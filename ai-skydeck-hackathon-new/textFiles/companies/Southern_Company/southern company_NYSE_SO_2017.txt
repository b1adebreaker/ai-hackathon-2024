Southern Company is one of only a few 

energy companies pursuing an “all of

developing and maintaining a diversified 

energy portfolio is essential to reducing 

carbon emissions, while maintaining 

reliability and affordability. Over the 

last decade, we have significantly trans-

formed our electricity generation mix.

megawatts (MW) of renewable generating 

capacity has been added across the system

tral resources, including 3,000 MW of 

renewable generating capacity, by 2022.

Partnering to provide state-of-the-art energy solutions

Southern Company subsidiary Georgia Power worked 

closely with design and construction consultant 

Darden & Company to help Mercedes-Benz Stadium 

become the only stadium in the U.S. to achieve 

LEED Platinum certification from the U.S. Green 

Building Council, the highest level of recognition 

for sustainability in building design. This was 

accomplished in part through the implementation 

of a 1 MW solar installation and 19 electric vehicle 

charging stations positioned throughout the campus. 

This helps the facility reach its sustainability goals by 

offsetting approximately 10 percent of the stadium’s 

energy consumption with 1.6 million kilowatt hours 

per year coming from on-site solar generation.

Voice of the Employee

We strive to promote and encourage 

open dialogue with our employees, 

welcoming employee feedback 

at any time for any reason. We 

understand that our employees 

are the most important aspect of 

our company, utilizing their talents 

and passions and working hard 

to produce unmatched service. 

To formally and anonymously 

collect feedback from employees, 

we conduct surveys periodically. 

We use this feedback to continu-

ously assess and improve the work 

environment for employees. The 

survey measures the strength of 

our culture and identifies areas for 

improvement. Most importantly, 

the survey helps create an envi-

ronment where employees feel 

valued and understood – giving 

them a greater sense of pride in 

the company and enabling them 

to better serve our customers.

efforts draw from diverse talent opportu-

nities such as college campuses, military 

installations, technical colleges, professional 

associations, conferences, job boards, social 

media outlets and networking events.

Modernization is decreasing the number 

of positions, which makes attracting, 

developing and retaining top talent even 

more important. Diverse hiring continues 

to outpace current representation.

Recruiting students

Our co-op and internship programs are designed to attract top talent 

by providing challenging work, meaningful leadership and professional 

responsibilities. One hundred years of strong partnerships with 

universities and colleges have built our competitive student co-op and 

intern programs. We actively recruit at 16 core schools, including several 

historically black colleges and universities with engineering programs. 

We also partner with various engineering associations, including the 

National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, 

Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the INROADS program,
