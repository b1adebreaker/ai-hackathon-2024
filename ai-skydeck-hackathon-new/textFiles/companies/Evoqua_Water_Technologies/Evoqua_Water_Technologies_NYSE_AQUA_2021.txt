A Message 
From 
Our CEO

Sustainability is core to what 
we do every day – providing 
solutions to protect and 
preserve one of our planet’s 
most valuable resources, water.

Sustainability is core to what we do every day – providing solutions 
to protect and preserve one of our planet’s most valuable resources, 
water. Our opportunity to make our customers’ water systems 
more sustainable is known as our Handprint. We are proud of and 
energized by the impact our Handprint has on water resiliency every 
day.

We are also driven to become more sustainable through our own 
actions, known as our Footprint. We believe our newly released 
sustainability goals relating to water reuse and reducing emissions, 
along with the implementation of water reuse and safety metrics 
in our annual incentive plan, will motivate our employees toward 
achieving our long-term strategy. 

Beyond our environmental goals, we are working to build a more 
inclusive and diverse culture, as will be evidenced in this report. We 
believe inclusion enables diversity to thrive and unites our employees 
around our purpose: Transforming Water. Enriching Life.®

Evoqua recognizes the importance of communicating with our 
stakeholders, and we have received positive recognition for our ESG 
reporting.* This report includes disclosure of our emissions and water 
data, including utilization of the standards set forth by the 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core Option and utilizing the 
recommendations provided by the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB).

customers build more sustainable water systems. We are committed 
to maintaining a technology-driven, customer-centric culture while 
offering a broad portfolio of water treatment products, services, and 
solutions that help solve global water challenges.

Finally, and through this report, we affirm our commitment to continue 
investing in innovation, creating an inclusive and diverse culture, and 
communicating the impact of our Footprint and our Handprint in 
working towards our purpose: Transforming Water. Enriching Life.® 

Sincerely,

Our Sustainability 
Goals

Helping our customers to be more sustainable through our solutions, 
known as our Handprint, is our opportunity. In November 2021, we 
announced two purposeful environmental goals to become more 
sustainable in our own operations. As an organization, we are also 
working to improve our safety performance. Aligning around common 
goals and impact areas is crucial to gain internal momentum towards our 
purpose: Transforming Water. Enriching Life.®

By 2035, Evoqua's 
facilities will seek to 
recycle and reuse 
more water than 
withdrawn.

Evoqua plans to set 
science-based targets 
by 2023, that will assist 
the company with its 
goal of reaching net-
zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050. 

For FY22, we aim 
to have our Total 
Recordable Incident 
Rate (TRIR) at less

Building a 
Sustainable Future

WE DEFINE OUR IMPACT THROUGH:

FOOTPRINT

Pursuing sustainability throughout
our internal operations.

While we withdraw 
approximately  
1.5 million gallons 
of water every day 
within our facilities, 
we also transform 
approximately  
100 billion gallons 
of water for our 
customers daily. 

Water scarcity, due to climate change and other factors, along with 
emerging contaminants in water, are growing concerns worldwide, 
impacting individuals, enterprises, communities, and governments. Safe 
and available water is critical to overall human health and well-being; 
however, certain sources estimate that as of early 2022, approximately 
2.4 billion people live in water-scarce areas1, and that by 2030, water 
scarcity could displace 700 million people.2 When considering the 
global economic landscape, few industries can thrive without a stable 
water supply, whether it is used to power the enterprise, required to 
feed its supply chain, or instrumental in creating a product itself.

At Evoqua, we work daily to build a more sustainable, healthy, and safe 
water system by providing water treatment solutions to communities, 
companies, and organizations worldwide. Evoqua is dedicated 
to developing and delivering solutions that help customers and 
communities protect the world's most valuable resource — water. 

CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION³ 
According to the United Nations, water is the core 
element through which people will feel the impacts 
of climate change.2 We are proud to help solve for a 
broad range of water treatment challenges through 
our technologies that enable water reuse such as, our 
mobile response units that enable customers to build 
resilient water systems. For more information on the 
SDGs, please see page 16 of this report.

A Message 
From Our  
CGO and  
CSO 

At Evoqua, we view sustainability as 
an opportunity, whether sharing our 
sustainability values with employees, helping 
our customers to understand how their water 
system can help meet their own sustainability 
goals, or developing new, efficient solutions 
that can solve water challenges related to 
SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation.

Water is one of the world’s most valuable resources. With water being 
identified by the United Nations as the primary medium through which 
we feel climate change*, it is inspiring to work for a company that is 
positioned to help mitigate water risk while improving health and safety. 
As Chief Growth and Sustainability Officer, I see first-hand how we 
address these challenges in communities and across industries.

At Evoqua, we view sustainability as an opportunity, whether sharing 
our sustainability values with employees, helping our customers 
to understand how their water system can help meet their own 
sustainability goals, or developing new, efficient solutions that can 
solve water challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal 6 
(SDG 6), Clean Water and Sanitation. By transforming approximately 
100 billion gallons of water a day for a variety of end markets, we have 
the opportunity to help our customers build more environmentally and 
socially responsible water systems. To help combat the effects of climate 
change on global water systems, we will continue to seek partnerships 
and innovative solutions to expand our positive Handprint.

* Read more about water and climate change from the United Nations 

As a company, we continue to identify new ways to reduce our 
operational Footprint. Over the next one and a half years, we plan to 
use the science-based target setting methodology to guide our mid-
term emission reduction targets, in line with the Paris Agreement's 
1.5°C pathway. We will continue working to further integrate a culture of 
sustainability within our organization through company-wide training on 
our Handprint and Footprint and other initiatives. We are committed to 
working with our customers, suppliers, peers, educational institutions, 
and other organizations to share best practices and strive to do better as 
we continue on our sustainability journey.

Sincerely,

Driving Innovation 
to Build Sustainable 
Water Solutions 

Sustainability is a consideration in our innovation process. 
Whether related to product life, customer impact, or 
manufacturing processes, we make decisions with potential 
environmental and social impacts in mind. One example of how 
we affect this is through our Sustainable Innovation Checklist. 
Implemented in FY21, this checklist enables us to systematically 
assess the multiple dimensions of sustainability when designing 
new products or solutions, including efficiencies, materials, end 
of life, and more. Innovation of digitally enabled solutions is 
another tool to improve sustainability within our business and 
our customers' operations. Our Water One® service enables us to 
increase customer uptime while reducing fleet mileage and ion 
exchange resin waste, among other things. For more information 
on our Water One Service, see page 16.

Investing in a  
New Sustainability  
and Innovation Hub

To support our efforts in developing 
cutting-edge and sustainable water 
treatment technologies that address 
critical water challenges, we opened 
our Sustainability and Innovation Hub in 
October 2021. The new facility serves as 
our center of excellence for research and 
innovation, addressing emerging water 
trends, including connectivity, health and 
safety, and the impacts of climate change 
on water.

The Sustainability and Innovation Hub 
is located in the Lawrenceville Tech 
Forge facility, part of Pittsburgh's urban 
technology park. This is an ideal location, 
as the area is home to a number of 
innovative companies in the region and 
conveniently located close to our world 
headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh. 
The 18,000 square-foot facility houses 
a hands-on demonstration and training 
area, pilot testing environment, and a 
state-of-the-art laboratory to grow our 
analytical and feasibility study capacity. 

The Hub focuses on elevating our 
connected and digital technologies, 
enhancing our waste-to-value treatment 
systems, and furthering the development 
of solutions to address emerging 
contaminants. The collaborative 
workspace is designed to efficiently 
analyze our customers' water quality to 
provide optimal, sustainable treatment 
solutions, illustrating our commitment to 
delivering excellence to our customers.

The establishment of the Sustainability 
and Innovation Hub aligns with our 
strategy for success through investment 
in research and development to 
help solve some of the world's most 
challenging water issues. Our vision 
for the Hub is to bring together 
technologies and innovative thinking to 
develop solutions that will empower our 
customers and help them respond to 
today's critical water challenges.

Our state-of-the-art 
Sustainability and Innovation 
Hub is dedicated to training 
and the development of 
next-generation treatment 
solutions.

APPENDIX

Both divisional and corporate Environment, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) resources 
investigate every product or service 
safety incident that occurs. We regularly 
test emergency response procedures 
as part of our EHS program, and part 
of our formal product recall procedures 
is to notify impacted customers. The 
Segment President for the product under 
investigation and our entire executive 
leadership team are engaged in the review. 
Corrective action may involve cross-
functional engagement from product 
management, corporate engineering, 
segment quality, strategic sourcing, and 
technology and innovation to address the 
issue. 

PRODUCT AND SAFETY TRAINING

OUR APPROACH TO QUALITY MANAGEMENT

Our employees are at the heart of every 
product and service we provide our 
customers. Employee product and safety 
training begins during our onboarding 
process, where each employee receives a 
mandatory overview of Evoqua's safety 
and quality programs. Training is tailored 
by location and job function to ensure 
employees are familiar with the safety and 
quality processes and programs specific to 
their role and responsibility. We train our 
employees and customers in product safety 
during installation and startup. 

CERTIFICATIONS 

We maintain an Integrated Management 
System Manual designed to help customers 
and employees understand management's 
commitment to establishing, implementing, 
and maintaining a management system aligned 
with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001 
requirements. It details our commitment to 
enhancing product quality, and in turn, safety. 
The manual, which includes our Management 
System Policy Statement, is available to all 
customers, employees, and personnel working

Sustainable 
Development Goals

As the world moves toward a more circular and sustainable 
economy, we believe that we are well-positioned to help our 
customers achieve their sustainability goals. Our broad portfolio 
of innovative products and services are aligned with the United 
Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)3 and help our 
customers solve their most complex water and wastewater 
treatment challenges, examples of which are outlined below. 
Aligning to the SDGs allows us to help our customers address the 
global challenges they may face, creating a more sustainable future.

CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION 

While SDG 6 is where we believe we have the most 
significant impact, we also help our customers 
meet other SDGs, including SDG 3, 7, 9, 12, and 13. 

HEALTH & WELLNESS We provide products and 
services to support disinfection and sanitization, which 
are critical to maintaining safe operations in hospitals, 
laboratories, food processing, and aquatic facilities by 
removing common and emerging contaminants. 

RENEWABLE ENERGY FROM WASTEWATER 
Our anaerobic digestion technology installations 
produce enough renewable energy to meet the 
electricity needs for the equivalent of ~5,000 
American homes per day.1 

In FY20, Evoqua was first recognized on the 
SDG2000 list by the World Benchmarking 
Alliance. This list contains the 2,000 companies 
with the greatest potential to influence a more 
sustainable future as envisioned in the SDGs. 
We are proud to remain one of the companies 
on this list working towards a better future.

SMART WATER Our award-winning Water One® service provides 
customers with reliable water quality and quantity when they 
need it through a digitally enabled, proactive service model. Based 
on our estimates, this service, which includes remote monitoring 
of systems, has enabled us to reduce the distance driven by our 

service technicians to customer sites by over 150,000 miles, which equates to a 
reduction of ~ 122 metric tons of CO₂ emissions.2 Our Water One service has also 
reduced the volume of chemicals used in our resin regeneration process in FY21 
by ~ 86,000 pounds, as compared to FY17 due to more efficient tank exchanges.2

CIRCULAR ECONOMY Evoqua reactivated ~ 13,000 tons of 
granular activated carbon and regenerated ~ 97,000 tons of resin in 
FY21. We reuse these materials through our carbon reactivation and 
resin regeneration services and ~110,000 tons of waste from going 
to landfills. Learn more on page 34.

CLIMATE MITIGATION With one of the largest fleets of temporary 
and rapid response mobile units in North America, Evoqua can 
provide clean water when and where it is needed most, aiding our 
customers through our Handprint. Internally, we are also working to 
manage our impact, known as our Footprint. In FY22, we set a goal 

to increase recycling and reuse of water in our facilities by 2035 and reach net-
zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Learn more on page 29. 

1 Evoqua Water Technologies anaerobic wastewater treatment systems produce approximately 540,000 m³ per day of biogas at installations around the world. This is utilized to produce an estimated 2,000,000 kWh of heat and 170,000 kWh of electricity every day. 

This estimate is based on average home electricity usage provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
2 Based on our review of data relating to just over 1,000 customers for the period from 2017 to 2021, we estimate that the digitally enabled remote monitoring service Water One® SD has allowed us to reduce the number of service trips to these customers during this 

period by 11%. This means less downtime and fewer disruptions for our customers. Based on the average time spent on a service trip and the average distance from our branches to these customer sites, we estimate that the reduction in service trips has resulted in 

approximately 9,400 fewer hours of time spent by our service technicians on service trips, fewer miles driven by our fleet, which in turn has reduced our CO2e emissions and chemicals consumed in our resin regeneration process.

Evoqua Water 
Sustainability  
Award

Our fourth annual Evoqua Water 
Sustainability Award Winner for 
2021 was Kimberly-Clark Corp.

Kimberly-Clark's sustainability strategy 
recognizes the need for strong water 
stewardship in its operations. The team 
continually looks for opportunities to make 
meaningful improvements in their processes 
for sustainable water use. Such was the case 
at their Maumelle, Arkansas manufacturing 
facility, where Kimberly-Clark was looking to 
be more water conscious. We worked with 
the facility to design a treatment solution 
to provide consistent, high-quality water 
output to meet their current and future 
water demands while taking advantage of 
water reuse opportunities. 

To reduce water withdrawal, instead of 
conventional reverse osmosis (RO), the 
Maumelle manufacturing facility was 
equipped with high recovery RO systems to 
treat the freshwater for their manufacturing 
processes. During the design phase, the 
Evoqua team integrated the new systems 
with existing pre-treatment solutions to 
minimize the footprint. The system's design 
includes Evoqua's Water One® service, which 
remotely monitors the deionized (DI) water 
system to ensure consistent, high-quality 
water output. Overall, the new treatment 
system has resulted in significant water and 
chemical savings for the facility. 

Read more on how Kimberly-Clark leveraged Evoqua's Water One® service to 
ensure consistent, high-quality water output and minimize their footprint.

The Evoqua Water 
Sustainability Award 
recognizes excellence in 
water stewardship. Winners 
include organizations using 
new or existing technologies 
in innovative and sustainable 
ways and have made significant 
strides in water efficiency. 
Each year, this recognition is 
awarded on World Water Day.

At Evoqua, we are dedicated to 
developing and delivering sustainable 
solutions that help our customers and 
communities protect the world's most 
valuable resource — water. Kimberly-
Clark's achievements in reducing and 
reusing water in their operations make 
it an exemplary company, and we are 
honored to be part of their sustainability 
journey.

Our Environmental 
Sustainability Goals

When we spoke with various stakeholders, during both our materiality 
assessment (page 17 of this report) and as part of our ongoing stakeholder 
engagement efforts (page 63 of this report), about the environmental 
issues related to climate change, water and emissions were identified as 
the primary areas where Evoqua could have a more significant impact. 
As a water technology company, water is crucial to our business and our 
solutions. Reducing emissions will require action across industries to help the 
earth remain below 1.5°C of warming. We help our customers mitigate water 
risk and the impacts of climate change on water systems, and we continue to 
look internally to do the same.

MITIGATING  
WATER RISK 
To address water risks related to climate change, Evoqua has 
adopted a goal to reuse more water than we withdraw by 2035. 
We are in the process of creating water management plans 
for our facilities to increase efficiency in our water usage and 
implement additional water recycling and reuse initiatives, using 
our technology wherever possible.

REACHING  
NET-ZERO EMISSIONS
Over the next one and a half years, Evoqua plans to use the 
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology to evaluate 
our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. The SBTi provides a framework 
for companies to set emission reduction targets that align with 
leading climate science and sector-relevant impacts. Currently, 
more than 2,000 businesses worldwide are working with the SBTi. 

We believe that following the SBTi methodology will guide our 
incremental greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets and 
help us reach our goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Managing Our 
Environmental Impact 

In FY21, we completed our first holistic review of Evoqua's 
Footprint, including GHG emissions, water usage, waste 
generation, and additional environmental inputs from our 
facilities. On an annual basis, we track our year-over-year 
progress with review by Evoqua's Internal Audit department. We 
facilitate regular best practice sharing among our top facilities to 
discuss valuable strategies to reduce our environmental impact. 
This includes topics such as installing LEDs, reusing materials, 
energy audits, upgrading HVAC systems, utilizing local/state/
federal incentives, and more. In FY22, we plan to create an 
internal dashboard for improved tracking and managing of our 
progress.

Emissions From 
Our Operations

For the next one and a half years, we plan to focus on setting our 
science-based targets (SBT). This includes reviewing scope 1 and 2 
data to ensure accuracy, which was completed for the data contained 
in this report. We also plan to evaluate our scope 3 emissions to 
determine whether a scope 3 target should be part of our SBT. 
Alongside evaluating our emissions, we are looking for more strategic 
opportunities at our facilities. As of September 30, 2021, renewable 
technologies account for roughly 16% of the electricity we utilize 
from the electric grid.1 We are currently evaluating opportunities 
to incorporate additional renewables into our portfolio. With scope 
2 comprising about 25% of our emissions, transitioning to more 
renewable sources will support our net-zero goal.2 Our scope 1 
emissions are nearly evenly distributed between fleet for our service 
vehicles and natural gas which is primarily used for heat process.

A Roadmap 
For Our Fleet

Evoqua's fleet, fueled from diesel and gasoline, accounts for approximately 
37% of our FY21 scope 1 and 2 emissions.* In FY21, we developed a three-year 
plan to reduce the environmental impact of our fleet. Due to unforeseen global 
supply chain challenges facing the automotive industry and competing business 
priorities, we were unable to pilot our projected number of hybrid vehicles in our 
first year of this three-year plan. Despite these challenges, we still made progress 
on our road to a more sustainable fleet and expect to continue to do so in FY22.

Pilot additional 
hybrid vehicles

PROGRESS 
IN FY21

Piloted a small number 
of hybrid vehicles to 
test functionality for 
our business

Developed a fleet dashboard 
to better monitor and 
enhance driver behavior on 
idle time, fuel usage, and 
driver safety

* Calculated using data from Evoqua's key facilities and fleet, which 
encompass over 90% of our internal environmental impact based on 
management estimates. 

Improved 
overall Miles 
Per Gallon 
(MPG) by

Reduced idle rate 
by 9% via driver 
education as part 
of our broader idle 
initiative

Rightsize our

Managing  
Our Water  
Withdrawal

Our products help our customers and communities with their water 
challenges every day. As a water technology company, water is just as 
critical to our operations, particularly at our resin regeneration sites. As 
of September 30, 2021, our top resin regeneration facilities comprise over 
80% of Evoqua’s overall water withdrawal. We are currently focusing on 
creating water management plans at these facilities to meet our water 
reuse goal.

METALS  
REMOVED
Evoqua continues to remove metals from customer aqueous 
solutions, averaging a 17% year-over-year increase in metal removal 
since 2019. From 2020 to 2021, we saw a 22% increase in metal 
removal. 

RESIN  
REGENERATED
We regenerated 96,842 tons of resin for 
reuse in FY21 avoiding the purchase of 
virgin resin and associated disposal. Learn

We avoided 12,924 tons of reactivated 
carbon from entering landfills. Learn

Our Roseville, Minnesota location removes dissolved heavy metals 
from a variety of rinse water and wastewater streams for our 
Wastewater Ion Exchange (WWIX) customers, so they are safely 
managed and recycled. Removing these heavy metals makes the 
water safe for our customer processes. Our team enables the media 
and metals to be reused whenever possible, avoiding landfills.

Safety at  
Our Core

Evoqua values Environmental Health 
and Safety (EHS) as an organizational 
responsibility that is integral to our 
success. The safety of our employees, 
and anyone who visits our facilities, is our 
top priority. Each year, Evoqua renews 
our commitment to safety with our EHS 
and Sustainability Policy, signed by our 
CEO. It states, "We (Evoqua) will provide 
our solutions, products, and services in a 
safe, environmentally sound, and socially 
responsible manner." 

Corporate EHS has governing 
responsibility of our operations. Most 
manufacturing locations have dedicated 
EHS personnel and safety committees 
responsible for investigating and reviewing 
accidents and communicating safety 
issues. All divisions host monthly reviews 
of both proactive and lagging safety 
measures. Our operating guidelines and 
procedures are relevant for our industry.

Our EHS team closely monitors our 
programs and internal goals through:

•  Monthly performance reviews at the 

executive level

•  Reviewing each recordable accident 

with the CEO and Executive 
Leadership Team (ELT), focusing on 
root cause and preventative action

•  Quarterly operation reviews and 
reports to the Board of Directors

•  Daily interactions with operation 

leaders

•  Routine checks of key performance 

indicators

•  Scheduled facility audits to ensure 

regulatory compliance

SAFETY GOAL
Total Recordable 
Incident Rate (TRIR) 
<1.0 for FY22

Our EHS Program

Our EHS program focuses on work environments where each 
employee is enabled, empowered, and embraces personal 
accountability for protecting their health and safety, as well as 
that of their co-workers. Every employee is encouraged to:

•  Perform a Take Two risk-assessment when they begin 

work and return from breaks

•  Follow standard work instructions for the work task they 

are performing

•  Utilize STOP WORK when they are unsure, come across 
an unexpected condition, have a concern, or see the 
potential for injury

There was a reduction in total work hours due to facility 
consolidation, which resulted in a slight increase in our 
Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) in FY21 as compared 
to FY20. To further improve our safety performance, we 
have established standardized EHS initiatives in both 
segments and are focusing on safety participation across 
the organization using resources like our EHS scorecards. 
These scorecards provide a detailed view of the use of our 
activity-based observation, feedback, challenging safety 
applications, and near misses and incidents. EHS scorecards 
are reviewed monthly with executives to ensure that 
individual leaders are accountable for routinely managing 
safety. Other methods intended to improve our health and 
safety performance in FY22 include: 

Increasing participation in safety reporting among 
employees, including observations, near misses, and 
safety challenges through our mobile applications.

Updating EHS training 
in our Learning 
Management System.

Streamlining our 
incident reporting 
process. 

Embracing the zero-incident safety culture model: 

•  Creating a zero-incident culture through leadership 

engagement and employee participation globally.

•  Providing coaching through employee feedback on the

Inclusion and  
Diversity

Our Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) 
strategy focuses on creating a sense 
of belonging to promote inclusion and 
spark opportunities. We aim to cultivate 
an inclusive environment that fosters 
diversity of thought, perspective, and 
demographic differences to flourish and 
grow as an organization. We continue 
to diversify our workforce and ensure 
our employees are safe, valued, and 
supported inside and outside the 
workplace. I&D at Evoqua is overseen by 
our Vice President of Human Resources 
and Talent and our Executive Vice 
President, Chief Human Resources 
Officer. At the Board level, the 
Compensation Committee of the Board 
of Directors oversees our I&D strategy.

We embrace inclusion and demand 
equal and fair treatment for all 
employees regardless of status. We 
have zero tolerance for any type of 
discrimination or harassment across 

our global organization. In FY21, we 
developed a mandatory company-wide 
unconscious bias training program, 
which will continue into FY22. This 
training educates employees about 
existing unconscious bias, enabling them 
to better understand, acknowledge, and 
manage how biases may be presented 
in our working environment and 
everyday lives. By recognizing how our 
choices and actions impact others, we 
can begin to work together to foster a 
stronger, more inclusive workplace. 

To increase diversity through our 
hiring practices, in FY21, we piloted 
diverse recruiting practices within two 
core divisions of our organization. 
We began requiring interview panels 
for senior leadership roles to include 
diverse personnel. We also adapted 
our branding language and imagery to 
include the diverse workforce of the 
future.

EQUITY SEQUENCE™ PROGRAM*

To systemically build an inclusive culture, we are training leaders at Evoqua to 
consider equity in their decision-making. We use a set of questions called the 
Equity Sequence™, that can be applied to any business initiative to reduce bias 
and increase inclusion. In FY22, these questions will be embedded into our 
current organizational processes, making it part of our daily work. The Evoqua 
Inclusion Network (EIN) will act as role models for the deployment of this 
practice and ambassadors of our enterprise I&D initiatives. 

At Evoqua, we 
believe inclusion 
enables diversity 
to thrive.

ANTHONY J. WEBSTER 
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,
CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER

EVOQUA INCLUSION NETWORK (EIN) 

To accelerate our inclusion initiatives, Evoqua established a 
core team of cross-functional and diverse employees who 
will serve as change leaders to ensure the establishment of 
embedded, specific, and transformative inclusion efforts. This 
group comprises employees at varying levels of the organization 
selected because of their passion for inclusion and diversity 
topics. This team is co-led by two senior business leaders and 
senior human resources leaders.

The Evoqua Inclusion Network is responsible for:

Setting the foundation 
for inclusion efforts 
to improve the 
effectiveness of I&D. 

Supporting learning 
opportunities that 
maximize action and 
produce systemic change.

Minimizing unconscious 
bias within key business 
decisions via system and 
process improvements.

Engaging a broader 
Evoqua network in 
supporting I&D initiatives.

Current Status 
Overview

While our inclusion and diversity efforts generally 
focus on the long-term culture of our organization, 
we are dedicated to transparency in our data. 
Women represented 20% of our organization's 
population at the end of FY21. Women make up 
25% of our senior leadership team. U.S. minorities 
make up 24% of our workforce. We are proud that 
despite the challenges of the pandemic and the 
disproportionate impact it has had on women and 
U.S. minorities, we have been able to maintain 
our representation in these groups. Employees 
identifying as military veterans increased slightly due 
to our self-identification initiative.

challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
employee wellness remains a top priority. 
We understand that some of the difficulties 
created by the pandemic may stem from 
challenging living and work situations, 
impeded physical and emotional health, and 
financial insecurity. As a company, we have 
provided resources to employees to support 
them as we transition to a new normal. Our 
Integrated Workforce Model (IWM) is designed 
to give employees flexibility in their work 
schedules to better balance life and work 
long-term. To ensure that our employees strike 
this balance, our leaders are enabled to work 
directly with their teams to determine how to 
meet business, team, and employee needs, 
while supporting greater choice in where work 
is done.

Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) 
provides appropriate resources when and 
where employees need them. We work 
with a financial services partner to educate 
employees on managing retirement and 
savings plans during turbulent times. 
Additionally, through our LIVE WELL program, 
we have arranged for employees to access 
complimentary fitness apps to exercise 
anytime, anywhere. Please see page 63 of this 
report for more on our LIVE WELL program.

U.S. locations follow a standard work week 
of 40 hours per week, 8 hours per day. Non-
exempt employees who work more than 40 
hours in a given workweek will be paid a 
minimum of time and a half. Where required 
by state or local law, employees who work 
more than 8 hours in a day will be paid daily 
overtime.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

We continue to look for opportunities to 
differentiate our employee programs and 
benefits. As a benefit to our full-time, salaried 
employees, we offer flexible, self-managed 
time off, enabling employees to take the time 
they need when they need it. We also have a 
parental leave policy for expecting parents. 
New benefits this year include fertility benefits 
and virtual physical therapy.1

All U.S. employees who have been with Evoqua 
for a minimum of one year (working 20 hours 
or more per week) are eligible to participate in 
Evoqua's Employee Stock Purchase Program 
(ESPP).2 Global employees can join with no 
minimum requirements in countries where the 
plan is available. U.S. employees classified as 
regular salaried or hourly (working a minimum 
of 20 hours per week) can participate in 
medical and pharmacy benefits, our tuition 
reimbursement program, and our 401(k) plan. 
Global employees are offered competitive 
healthcare and retirement programs.

1 Fertility and Virtual Therapy Benefits apply to U.S. employees only. 
2 Generally, all U.S. employees who have been employed by Evoqua or a designated subsidiary under the plan for a minimum of one year (working 20 hours or 
more per week and more than 5 months per calendar year) are eligible to participate in Evoqua's Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP).2 Employees of 
designated non-U.S. subsidiaries, however, can join without meeting such employment requirements in countries where plan participation is available through an 
approved international sub-plan, although each such employee must reside in the country where the designated non-U.S. subsidiary employing the employee is 
located.

SURVEYING OUR EMPLOYEES 

In FY21, we introduced an employee pulse survey 
to periodically measure employee engagement and 
receive feedback from our employees. The feedback 
from the surveys provide Evoqua with actionable 
insights to improve our employee experience. The 
three pulse surveys deployed in FY21 surveyed 
1,603 employees. In FY22, we plan to re-evaluate 
the timing and cadence of our surveys and include 
questions on inclusion.

On Tap for FY22
We have incorporated water 
stewardship and safety 
metrics into our employee 
Annual Incentive Program 
(AIP) for FY22.

Learning and 
Development

At Evoqua, we believe there is no one-
size-fits-all approach to development 
and that most learning happens in the 
workplace. Through programs like our 
Field Service Professional Engagement 
programs, internships, apprenticeships, 
co-op, and Leadership Development 
Program, employees learn new skills and 
gain the experience they can leverage 
throughout their careers. We added 152 
new learning programs to our Learning 
Management System (LMS) in FY21, 
which expanded training opportunities 
in management, safety, employee 
onboarding experience, and more. In 
FY21, 4,421 employees took training 
modules through our LMS.

Evoqua's interns and co-ops support 
vital projects that help drive success 
within our organization. Throughout 
FY21, Evoqua hosted 38 interns who 
gained exposure in areas such as, 
operations, sustainability, engineering, 
finance, and sales. Evoqua's internship 

program is one of our emerging talent 
programs that provides an external 
talent pipeline into Evoqua.

ENTERPRISE CAREER PATHS

In FY21, we established five full career 
paths for sales, project management, 
engineering, customer excellence 
(customer service, operational support 
and sales support), and commercial 
(non-sales customer-facing roles) 
employees. Each career path includes a 
toolkit that enables employees to grow 
their careers while supporting cross-
functional growth.

Currently, about 60% of Evoqua 
employees are represented in a 
career path. Information technology, 
manufacturing, and production career 
paths are under development for FY22, 
representing roughly another 30% of the 
employee base.

In FY21, we conducted a training 
module titled Sustainability 
101, which engaged our 
global employee base in our 
sustainability strategy and 
initiatives. In FY22, we will include 
additional company-wide training 
on sustainability topics, such as 
our Handprint and Footprint.

Supporting  
Our Communities

We recognize that our employees are 
driven by meaningful, purpose-driven 
volunteer opportunities. In FY21, we 
built a Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) program to support employees 
looking to make an impact in their 
local community and established a 
framework for corporate giving. Our 
CSR program will be led by a diverse 
group of employees, energized by their 
mission to connect our people with their 
passion. This program will launch in 
FY22 with a focus on further promoting 
corporate volunteering.

UPCYCLING MATERIALS TO 
COMMUNITY GROUPS

Our wastewater treatment team based 
in Derby, United Kingdom, is committed 
to reusing materials that their facility 
would otherwise discard. Seeking 
organizations that could put their 
legacy materials and spares to good 
use, the team partnered with a local 
electrical engineering company that 
takes our discarded parts and gives 
them a new life as lighting for non-profit 
organizations. This year, the partnership 

installed lighting for the Scouts youth 
organization. The extra lighting allows 
the group to operate safely outdoors 
so they can continue meeting while 
maintaining appropriate COVID-19 social 
distancing guidelines. 

Our Derby team also donated a 20-foot 
container to a local middle school. The 
container found new life as storage for 
essential school equipment and supplies 
outside of the building, helping teachers 
give each student the room they need 
to meet COVID-19 social distancing

THE HOLIDAY PROJECT

Our Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, team 
provided meaningful gifts for 145 
children through the Allegheny County 
Holiday Project. This was Evoqua's 
fourth year working with the Holiday 
Project. With the growing number of 
children in the foster care system in 
Pittsburgh and around the U.S., gifts 
from the Holiday Project provide 
an invaluable sense of normalcy for 
children whose lives are shaped by daily 
challenges.

WALKING FOR WATER

In recognition of World Water Day on March 22, 2021, 
our employees participated in the month-long Walk 
for Water Challenge. Walk for Water raises awareness 
around water scarcity while also challenging 
participants to incorporate walking into their daily 
routines. For each of the over 1,600 miles walked 
by our employees, a donation was made to directly 
fund a clean water project with charity: water, whose 
mission is to implement sustainable, community-
owned water projects in remote communities.

Our Board of 
Directors

Since Evoqua's IPO in November 
2017, we have been actively engaged 
in Board development efforts. We 
have recruited five talented directors 
to join our Board in the past five 
years. Currently, eight out of the nine 
directors on our Board (approximately 
90%) are independent according to 
our Corporate Governance Guidelines 
and the New York Stock Exchange 
corporate governance standards. 
An independent director chairs our 
Board, and all members of the Board's 
standing committees are independent. 
Only one of our directors lacks 
independence – our CEO. 

The Board of Directors has the 
following standing committees: 
Audit Committee, Compensation 
Committee, and Nominating and 

Corporate Governance Committee. In 
FY21, we held seven Board meetings. 
All directors attended at least 75% of 
the total meetings of the Board and 
each committee on which the director 
served during FY21 (for the period 
during which the director served); the 
average attendance rate was greater 
than 95%. Following most Board 
meetings, non-employee directors 
hold executive sessions without 
members of Evoqua management 
present. To continually improve our 
performance, the Board and each 
standing committee conduct an 
annual self-evaluation. For additional 
information, please see our Proxy 
Statement.

BOARD DIVERSITY 

In the process of searching for qualified persons to serve on the 
Board, the Board strives for the inclusion of diverse knowledge 
and viewpoints, and considers age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, and other personal characteristics. Three 
of our current board members self-identify as diverse based on their 
race or ethnicity and three members self-identify as female. Since 
October 2018, our Corporate Governance Guidelines have provided 
that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will 
include, and request that any search firm it engages include, female 
and racially/ethnically diverse candidates in the initial pool from which 
new director nominees are selected, otherwise known as the "Rooney 
Rule." The five directors who have joined our Board since 2018 include 
three women and two men, and two of these individuals self-identify 
as racially or ethnically diverse.

Ethics and

Integrity is the first of our core values. 
Our commitment to work safely and 
honestly, and to respect our employees, 
business partners and the environment 
must be our top priority. 

VINCENT GRIECO

EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,  
GENERAL COUNSEL AND SECRETARY

The Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee is responsible for periodically 
reviewing our Code of Ethics and Business 
Conduct and approving any proposed 
changes thereto. 

At least annually, the Audit Committee 
receives a report on and meets with the 
General Counsel and the Director of Ethics 
and Compliance to discuss systems for 
monitoring compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations, and our Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct.

Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
is available on our company website and 
refers to many of our policies. The Code of 
Ethics and Business Conduct applies to our 
directors, officers (including our principal 
executive officer, principal financial officer, 
principal accounting officer), and employees. 

All employees are required to annually certify 
compliance with the Code of Conduct. In 
FY21, 100% of our employees completed 
the Code of Conduct employee signoff. This 
report outlines a few policies that are specific 
to ESG. 

Evoqua is committed to regularly 
communicating and training on ethics and 
compliance topics to maintain the highest 
levels of integrity. With our global training 
initiatives and targeted training for specific 
functions, we regularly see over 90% 
completion on our training modules. The 
Ethics and Compliance team also works with 
the ELT to develop and deliver ethics and 
compliance messaging to the organization. 
This leadership is a demonstration of our 
commitment to doing business with integrity.

ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY

In our strides to maintain the highest 
possible ethical standards, Evoqua has a 
comprehensive Anti-Corruption Policy that 
details information on prohibiting bribes, both 
governmental and commercial; training on 
anti-corruption policies and procedures; due 
diligence on all third-party intermediaries, 
with continuous monitoring of high-risk third 
parties; strict requirements around gifts, 
travel, and entertainment of government 
officials; and internal auditing of anti-
corruption program policies, procedures, 
and controls. To prevent corruption, our 
management team receives periodic, targeted 
anti-corruption training. To our knowledge, 
we had no instances of bribery, corruption, or 
anti-competitive practices in FY21.

Whistleblower 
Program and Policy

Evoqua is committed to conducting business 
ethically and legally. This is underlined 
by our belief that no profit is ever worth 
compromising employee safety or the 
company's integrity. 

Evoqua's Compliance Helpline is managed 
by a third-party and is available twenty-
four hours a day, seven days a week. Our 
Employee Concern Policy provides that 
anyone using the compliance helpline 
can report anonymously without fear of 
retaliation. The purpose of the policy is 
to provide avenues for and encourage 
employees to raise concerns internally for 
investigation and resolution. Employee 
concerns are taken seriously, and we are 
committed to investigating and responding 
to every report. Our independent helpline 
is available for all internal and external 
parties in six languages. We proactively 
communicate the helpline's availability to 
employees through our employee newsletter, 
website, intranet, printed materials, and 
regular communication throughout the year, 
including employee town halls. The helpline 
and Ethics and Compliance team are available 
to help employees by providing guidance 
on compliance-related topics or any other 
concerns that could impact the company's 
integrity.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Our Conflicts of Interest Policy applies to 
all our directors, officers, and employees. 
Conflicts between personal interests and the 
company's interests can introduce ethical 
and legal challenges that jeopardize the 
reputation and the integrity of Evoqua and 
our directors, officers, and employees. Clear 
guidance on identifying, disclosing, analyzing, 
and mitigating actual or potential conflicts 
builds trust and reinforces a culture of 
integrity.

BUSINESS PARTNER CODE OF CONDUCT

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct 
applies to representatives, agents, 
distributors, and other channel partners, 
ensuring that any persons or entities acting 
on behalf of Evoqua are held to the same 
high standards as our Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct. Our Business Partner 
Code of Conduct is designed to reflect the 
current business, ethics, and compliance risks. 
The Code is modeled after the Responsible 
Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. 
All business partners are required to certify 
the Business Partner Code of Conduct at 
onboarding and at the time of contract 
renewal, if applicable.

Our Approach to 
Risk Management

RISK OVERSIGHT

We acknowledge that with our business 
comes risk. Evoqua has processes in 
place for identifying, managing, and 
mitigating potential risks while also 
assessing areas of opportunity for our 
company. Risk management is vital 
to our mission: Transforming Water. 
Enriching Life.®

Management is responsible for 
identifying, assessing, prioritizing, 
and managing Evoqua's risks. A 
management-level Risk Committee 
supports risk management activities 
within each functional area. The Risk 
Committee monitors the effectiveness 
of the risk management structures 
and advises our Executive Leadership 
Team on the effectiveness of 
those structures and strategies for 
prioritizing and mitigating enterprise 
risks.

Our full Board is responsible for 
overseeing management of the 
business and affairs of the company 

in a manner consistent with the best 
interests of the organization and our 
stockholders. In this oversight role, 
our Board must actively evaluate 
management's business strategies, 
plans, policies, and activities and 
understand management's approach 
to identifying, assessing, and managing 
the associated risks and opportunities. 
Due to the broader implications of 
certain categories of risk, such as 
financial, compensation, cybersecurity, 
human capital management, and 
ESG and sustainability, our Board 
coordinates oversight of these risks 
with its standing committees.

The Audit Committee of the Board 
of Directors is responsible for the 
company's enterprise risk management 
framework and its policies and 
procedures for risk management, 
including our company's cybersecurity 
risk exposure. For more on each 
committee's area of oversight, please 
visit our Proxy Statement, page 36. 

We acknowledge the importance of the Task Force on CIimate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations on risks and opportunities 
related to climate change. In the coming years, we will begin to further 
align our disclosures to these recommendations.

Cybersecurity

KEEPING DATA SAFE 

The data Evoqua owns and controls is among 
its most valuable assets. We have adopted 
measures to mitigate potential risks associated 
with information technology disruptions and 
cybersecurity threats; however, there is no 
assurance that these measures will prevent 
cyber-attacks or security breaches. The 
safety of the information that our customers, 
employees, suppliers, and stakeholders share 
with us remains a priority.

Evoqua maintains an Information Security 
Program to monitor and help mitigate 
our cybersecurity risk and ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our 
information systems and data. The program 
aligns to the National Institute of Standards and 

Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework 
(CSF), Special Publications 800-53 and 800-
171, and is evaluated through our internal audit 
activities and periodic external assessments. 
The Information Security Program includes an 
information security policy, system logging 
and monitoring, vulnerability and patch 
management, and a detailed incident response 
program so threats can be quickly evaluated. 
For more information on how we operate our 
program, see page 37 of our Proxy Statement.

We protect data based on its value and 
corresponding risk. Gaining stakeholder consent 
for the processing, sharing, and storage of their 
data includes following industry standards, such 
as our privacy policy and Our Code of Ethics 
and Business Conduct. Our third-party risk 

management program evaluates our IT partners 
throughout their lifecycle with us, assessing 
them for potential threats to our company.

Each year, we require our employees to take 
cybersecurity awareness training courses 
through our Learning Management System, 
which details best practices to prevent 
information security breaches. In addition 
to training, employees receive regular 
communications on cybersecurity, including 
email phishing exercises, posts in our electronic 
newsletter, and a dedicated intranet site. 

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors 
is responsible for monitoring the company's 
Information Security Program and periodically 
receives reports from the Chief Information 
Officer and Chief Information Security Officer.

Supply Chain

We maintain a cost-effective, diversified 
procurement program through strong 
relationships with strategic suppliers 
across critical inputs. Our supply 
chain's top acquired materials include 
chemicals, membranes, resin, metal 
fabrications, carbon, and electrical 
components. We seek sources of supply 
from multiple suppliers and often from 
various geographies. Our strategy has 
proven especially effective throughout 
the COVID-19 pandemic as we were able 
to source critical materials and mitigate 
risk, all while delivering cost-effective 
goods for our customers.

We have a comprehensive Supplier 
Code of Conduct to ensure we partner 
with businesses that share our mandate 
to respect international human and 
environmental rights and good business 
ethics. The procedures we have in 
place help us manage compliance-
related issues associated with our 
vendors and business partners. We 
provide training to our employees on 
our monitoring program to vet and 
monitor our customers and suppliers. 
We are dedicated to a supply chain that 
respects human rights. We reinforce this 
through our Supplier Code of Conduct, 

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, 
Modern Slavery Statement, and Conflict 
Minerals Policy. To further integrate 
sustainability best practices into our 
supply chain, in FY21, we updated our 
Supplier Code of Conduct. 

To mitigate risk in our supply chain, 
we question our suppliers on their 
environmental practices during the 
supplier onboarding process and require 
certification of our Supplier Code prior 
to engagement. This process is intended 
to assure us that we are engaging 
suppliers who follow compliant and 
ethical business practices and share our 
commitment to these principles.

Our Supply Chain Protocol is a two-
phased process. It includes: (1) an 
initial assessment that each supplier 
must complete, including a supplier 
questionnaire, which is evaluated to 
determine if we will use their products, 
and (2) a second assurance phase, our 
Compliance Requirement Auditing 
process. We also monitor our suppliers 
and customers for major compliance 
incidents and systematically monitor 
our suppliers for major environmental 
controversies.

Supplier  
Diversity Program

In FY21, we focused on supplier diversity to meet our customers' 
needs and align with our core value: sustainable. We believe that 
inclusion and diversity is a primary catalyst for innovation. To 
achieve this, we plan to seek opportunities to develop mutually 
beneficial relationships with small, minority-owned, women-owned, 
disadvantaged, disabled, LGBTQ, and veteran-owned business 
enterprises. Our Supplier Diversity Policy further details our next 
steps to promote diversity within our supply chain. 

Committing to a diverse 
supply chain today will 
generate opportunities for 
underrepresented groups 
tomorrow and beyond. 

JAMES M. KOHOSEK 
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,
CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER

Goals 
of Our 
Program:

Continuous 
development of 
a resilient supply 
chain.

Promote the inclusion 
of diverse suppliers 
in our global 
procurement process.

Create economic 
growth for new 
suppliers and their 
communities.

Foster continuous improvement between 
new and existing suppliers and provide the 
best value for Evoqua's customers.

OUR PROGRESS 

In FY21, we developed a supplier diversity policy and a web page 
that communicates our commitment to supplier diversity and the 
goals that will help us progress on our journey. 

Approximately 6% of Evoqua’s global spend during FY21 was 
with diverse suppliers. In FY22, we have set a goal to improve 
this while continuing to focus on customer fulfillment. If supply 
chain disruptions stabilize this year, we hope that our ability to 
increase our diverse spending while meeting customer needs 
becomes more achievable.

A business is recognized as a diverse supplier when it is at least 51% owned and operated by an individual or group that is part of a 
traditionally marginalized, underutilized, and underrepresented group. Currently, we are accepting self-identification of diverse suppliers. 
Commencing December 2022, we will ask all of our current suppliers to become certified to be considered a diverse supplier. We 
encourage all suppliers to get their certification from a third party local, state, or federal organization such as the National Minority 
Supplier Development Council or the Small Business Administration.

organization and its supply chain

OUR RESPONSE 

We maintain a cost-effective and diversified procurement program focused on supply chain continuity and 
customer fulfillment, utilizing strong relationships with strategic suppliers across key commodities. The top 
materials in our supply chain include chemicals, membranes, resin, metal fabrications, carbon, and electrical 
components. The procurement strategy within the project environment is focused on ensuring our ability to meet 
individual customer needs, with a particular focus on more complex installation projects. We seek to in-source 
products that align with our existing manufacturing core competencies and enable us to provide our customers 
with the highest level of value. Our diversified supply base spans multiple suppliers and geographies, allowing us 
to be cost-effective and responsive while embracing our sustainability objectives.

On December 17, 2020, we acquired the industrial water business of Ultrapure & Industrial Services, LLC 
(“Ultrapure”) for $8.7 million cash paid at closing. On April 1, 2021, we paid an additional $0.3 million due to net 
working capital adjustments. Ultrapure, based out of Texas, provides customers across multiple end markets 
with a variety of water treatment products and services, including service deionization, reverse osmosis, UV, and 
ozonation. Ultrapure strengthens our service capabilities in Houston and Dallas, Texas, and is part of our Integrated 
Solutions and Services segment. 

On April 1, 2021, we acquired the assets of Water Consulting Specialists, Inc. (“WCSI”) for $12.0 million cash paid 
at closing. WCSI is a leader in the design, manufacturing, and service of industrial high-purity water treatment 
systems. The acquisition strengthens our portfolio of high-purity water treatment systems and provides the

OUR RESPONSE 

•  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s primary responsibilities and functions are as 

follows:
 – The company’s director nominations process and procedures.
 – Evaluating the performance of the Board.
 – Developing and maintaining the company’s corporate governance policies. 
 – Oversight of the company’s key policies and strategies with respect to its environmental impact, 

sustainability practices, and corporate responsibility initiatives.

Snehal A. Desai, Chief Growth and Sustainability Officer, leads the company’s sustainability program. Our 
sustainability program is governed through a multi-tiered structure. It is designed to cover each of the broad 
categories of sustainability topics that we have identified, with assistance from our stakeholders. On a day-
to-day basis, our core Sustainability Team manages our sustainability program and coordinates with the 
individual workgroups that focus on each sustainability topic. We also maintain a Sustainability Steering 
Team, composed of vice presidents and senior managers from different functional areas, which monitor 
stakeholders’ interests. The Sustainability Steering Team advises the Executive Leadership Team on priorities 
to pursue under our sustainability program and reports to our Chief Growth and Sustainability Officer and 
periodically to the full Executive Leadership Team. 

The Chief Growth and Sustainability Officer reports directly to our CEO and provides quarterly updates to the 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding the management of the sustainability program, 
goal-setting, and reporting activities. For more information, see our Proxy Statement, page 38. 

102-21 Consulting stakeholders on

the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and the corporate governance standards of the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE). The sole non-independent member of our Board is Ron C. Keating. Mr. Keating is 
not independent because of his employment with the company as an executive officer. 100% of the members 
of the key committees of the Board (Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committees) are independent.

102-24 Nominating and selecting the 
highest governance body

OUR RESPONSE 

We believe a leadership structure with a separate CEO and Board Chairperson is appropriate for our company at 
this time due to the differences between the two roles. The CEO is responsible for setting our strategic direction, 
providing day-to-day leadership, and managing our business. The Board Chairperson provides guidance to 
the CEO, chairs Board meetings, sets the agendas for Board meetings, and maintains the flow of information 
to Board members in advance of and in between Board meetings. Currently, separating these leadership roles 
allows our CEO to focus on developing and implementing business strategies and objectives and monitoring 
our company's day-to-day management and performance. The Board Chairperson, on the other hand, is able to 
provide independent oversight of our company, serve as an independent liaison between our management and 
the members of our Board in providing feedback to our CEO, and focus on governance of our Board, including 
Board composition and the recruitment of new directors, Board meeting schedules and agenda-setting, and 
information flow and management reporting to the Board. For more information, please see our Proxy Statement, 
page 27.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee monitors our Board's composition and its committees, 
identifies and evaluates potential director candidates, and makes recommendations to the entire Board on these 
matters. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the company’s strategy, business, 
structure, and input from our CEO on strategic priorities when developing a search for a director candidate. 
Candidates for nomination to the Board may be suggested by current directors, management, stockholders, or a 
third-party search firm engaged to assist with director recruitment.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have specific minimum qualifications that must 
be met for a prospective director candidate to be nominated. However, when identifying potential candidates, 
it focuses on individuals with particular experience, background, qualifications, and skills, as summarized above 
under “Composition of the highest governance bodies and its committees.” The Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee considers diversity in knowledge and viewpoints and considers age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other personal characteristics in reviewing potential candidates. 
Additionally, under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
will request that any search firm include female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates in the initial pool from 
which the new director nominees are selected (also known as the “Rooney Rule”).

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may engage a third-party consulting firm to conduct 
director candidate searches. In such cases, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides the 
consulting firm with guidance on the experience, background, qualifications, and skills it is seeking in potential 
candidates. The consulting firm provides research and pertinent information and recommends candidates 
who satisfy such criteria. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then evaluates the potential 
candidates recommended by the consulting firm.

We expect our Board to thoughtfully appraise its performance as the highest governing body of our company. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee establishes and oversees a process for the annual 
evaluation of the Board and each standing committee thereof. On an annual basis, our Board and each of its 
committees conducts a self-evaluation under the framework that has been established by the Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee, including with respect to performance and effectiveness. Each committee and 
the full Board separately discuss the results of its self-evaluation, in conjunction with the organizational meeting 
of our Board that is held following our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The FY21 evaluation process resulted in a 
continuing focus on strategy and adjustments to time allocation for meetings. For more information, please see

the extent applicable, with our works councils, are good.

Evoqua’s Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) management system aligns with the essential elements 
of the ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007. The multi-tiered governance and oversight structure 
of our global EHS program is designed to facilitate the flow of communication throughout our entire 
organization regarding safety priorities, data trends, and other critical matters. Our EHS team closely 
monitors our program through monthly performance reviews at the executive level; our Chief Executive 
Officer and members of the leadership team review every recordable accident; quarterly operations review 
meetings and Board of Director reports; daily interactions with operations’ leaders; routine reviews of key 
performance indicators; and regular facility audits to verify compliance. Our EHS management system 
covers all Evoqua employees. Our scope includes the major product and service categories associated with 
the primary functions of manufacturing water and wastewater treatment solutions at multiple locations 
and distributing the product to industrial, municipal, and commercial customers worldwide. Contractors, 
service providers, and visitors should be made aware of and conform to the EHS Management System when 
working at Evoqua controlled facilities.

403-2 Hazard identification, risk
assessment, and incident investigation

Through our Incident Report and Investigation Program, which includes executive oversight, we have 
established reporting procedures for work-related injuries and significant non-injury losses that are focused 
on:

1.  Ensuring prompt medical care for injured employees. 

2.  Providing accurate and timely reporting of incidents within the organization and to governmental 

agencies, as required. 

3.  Providing management with the tools to determine the root causes of incidents, implement corrective 
and preventive actions to prevent their recurrence, and sharing this knowledge throughout Evoqua.

403-3 Occupational health services

We maintain an EHS program focused on work environments where each employee is enabled, empowered, 
and embraces personal accountability for protecting their health and safety, as well as that of their co-
workers. Every employee is empowered to:

403-4 Worker participation, consultation,
and communication on occupational
health and safety

1.  Perform a safe performance self-assessment when they begin work. 

2.  Follow standard work instructions for the job they are performing. 

3.  STOP WORK when they have a concern or see the potential for injury.

Information and resources can be found for workers on the Evoqua intranet site. 

We pride ourselves on our ability to communicate our EHS management system with integrity and 
transparency to our employees. Details on the system are communicated via the Evoqua intranet site and 
through targeted programs and training. The majority of our locations have EHS committees responsible for 
investigating and reviewing accidents and communicating safety issues. All of our divisions hold monthly 
calls to review safety issues. Our operating guidelines and procedures are relevant for our industry. 

In the U.S. and Canada, we rely upon our Daily Tiered Accountability Boards (TABs), start of shift meetings, 
and toolbox talks for employees to receive safety information and raise safety concerns. In EMEA, we rely 
upon our works councils, which comprise a network including human resources, employee representatives, 
and operations management to address employee health and well-being. The manufacturing locations 
also utilize TABs. In APAC, we rely upon safety committees comprised of employees and management. 
Ultimately, all employees can raise concerns through the Compliance Helpline.

403-5 Worker training on occupational
health and safety

403-6 Promotion of worker health

We have implemented targeted programs to ensure employees receive initial training, followed by regular 
refresher training. We also reinforce hazard awareness for slips, trips, and falls; strains and sprains; and body 
parts in the line of fire in our employee safety orientation, routine in-person and online safety training, safety 
alerts and messages, monthly safety calls, and our company-wide newsletters.

The wellness of our employees is extremely important at Evoqua. We recognize that our employees’ good 
health and well-being allow them to out-perform in the workplace and live a happy and rewarding life. We 
offer full health benefits, matching and profit-sharing contributions to the employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, 
a flexible work environment, and an Employee Assistance Program. Beyond traditional benefits, we think 
holistically about wellness. The mission of our LIVE WELL program is to create a work environment where 
employees have the tools, resources, and support system that will motivate and empower individuals to 
take responsibility and live a healthier lifestyle. LIVE WELL’s pillars include: Move More, Eat Better, Be Safer, 
and Be Mindful. Please visit page 42 of this report for more information on promoting worker wellness.

403-7 Prevention and mitigation of 
occupational health and safety impacts 
directly linked by business relationships

To prevent occupational health and safety impacts, Evoqua relies upon our EHS applications. This is how 
we identify and track EHS issues to closure. These applications include employee observations, safety 
challenges in which hazards are identified and tracked to closure, reporting of safety incidents that lead to 
investigations, and correctives that are also tracked to closure. 

Further information on our approach to preventing or mitigating significant adverse occupational health 
and safety impacts linked to our operations, products, services, our business relationships, and the related 
hazards and risks can be found in our EHS&S policy on page 36 of this report.
