global pandemic and unveiled the long-standing inequity within our 
society. Significant challenges such as these provide the opportunity for 
reflection, growth, and action.

At Evoqua Water Technologies, we have managed through the pandemic 
alongside our employees and our customers. We have worked to ensure 
safe working conditions while maintaining continuity of water supplies 
for our customers. As an essential business, we work every day, through 
the solutions and services that we provide to our customers, which we 
refer to as our Handprint, to build a more resilient and sustainable water 
system. Our team helps communities and industry solve challenges 
caused by climate change and build safe and healthy water systems. 
We appreciate the opportunity to serve our customers each day by

We continue to make progress on our internal sustainability journey, 
which we call our Footprint. Sustainable is one of our core values. We 
are measuring our environmental impact, and we are working toward 
setting our goals and defining our improvements for the future. We 

continue to examine our inclusion and diversity strategy to bring more 
value to our organization. Our Board of Directors is attuned to the value 
and opportunities created by diversity and actively considers racial, 
ethnic and gender diversity in our selection of director candidates. The 
most recent additions to our Board are two independent directors who 
increase the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of our Board membership.

Evoqua is dedicated to developing and delivering sustainable solutions 
that help customers and communities protect the world's most valuable

CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION 

While SDG 6 is where Evoqua has the 
most significant impact, we also help our 
customers meet other SDGs, including 
SDG 3, 7, 9, 12, and 13.

HEALTH & WELLNESS | We provide products and 
services to support disinfection and sanitization, 
which are critical to maintaining safe operations in 
hospitals, laboratories, aquatics, and food processing 
by removing common and emerging contaminants.

RENEWABLE ENERGY FROM WASTEWATER  
Our anaerobic digestion technology installations 
produce enough renewable energy to meet the 
electricity needs for the equivalent of 5,000 
American homes per day.1

SMART WATER | Our award-winning Water One® service provides 
customers with reliable water quality and quantity when they need 
it through a digitally enabled, proactive service model. Based on 
our estimates, this service, which includes remote monitoring of 
systems, has enabled us to reduce the number of miles driven by 
our service technicians to customer sites by over 100,000 miles, which equates 
to a reduction of approximately 80 metric tons of CO₂ emissions, and reduced 
the volume of chemicals used in our resin regeneration process by approximately 
58,000 pounds, as compared to FY17.2

CIRCULAR ECONOMY | Evoqua reactivated 14,994 tons of granular 
activated carbon and regenerated 51,929 tons of resin. Through 
our carbon reactivation and resin regeneration services, we can 
reuse these materials and prevent over 65,000 tons from going to 
landfills.

CLIMATE MITIGATION | With one of the largest fleets of temporary 
and rapid response mobile units in North America, Evoqua can 
provide clean water when and where it is needed most. Internally, 
we are also working to manage our impact. In FY20 we reduced 
our emissions of CO₂ from fossil fuel use by 1,541 metric tons as 
compared to FY19.³

1 Evoqua Water Technologies’ anaerobic wastewater treatment systems produce approximately 540,000 m³ per day of biogas at installations around the world. This is utilized to produce an estimated 2,000,000 kWh of heat and 170,000 kWh of electricity every day. 
This estimate is based on average home electricity usage provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  
2 These calculations are based on our review of data relating to just over 1,000 customers for the period from 2017 to 2020. We estimate that the digitally enabled remote monitoring service Water One® SD has allowed us to reduce the number of service trips to these 
customers during this period by 12%. This means less downtime and fewer disruptions for our customers. Based on the average time spent on a service trip and the average distance from our branches to these customer sites, we estimate that the reduction in service 

trips has resulted in approximately 6,300 fewer hours of time spent by our service technicians on service trips. 
3 Calculated using data from Evoqua's key facilities and fleet which encompass over 90% of our internal environmental impact based on management estimates.

We developed an internal 
team to drive impact across 
Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) factors.

The findings led us to two frames of reference 
for defining our sustainability impact:

HANDPRINT

Enabling our customers to become 
more sustainable through our 
solutions and service offerings.

FOOTPRINT

Evoqua’s responsibility to become 
more sustainable in our internal 
operations.

Our Path Forward

Throughout this report, you will see our progress 
this past year toward our goals. As an outcome 
of our materiality assessment, we developed our 
sustainability strategy, which was adopted by our 
company in late FY20. Our goals in the coming 
year are to continue our progress and enhance 
our disclosure going forward.

Evoqua Water 
Sustainability  
Award

Our third annual Evoqua Water 
Sustainability Award Winner for 2020 
was Bush Brothers and Company.

Other finalists for the 2020 award include Bellefonte Borough Authority 
Treatment Plant and Austin Energy. Learn more about the winner and finalists.

Bush Brothers and Company, America’s largest 
manufacturer of prepared beans, has been 
recognized for demonstrating multiple noteworthy 
improvements in its water sustainability efforts. 
The family-owned business has been operating in 
Chestnut Hill, Tennessee, for more than 110 years 
and consistently aims to reduce its impact on the 
community. When the local community faced water 
scarcity and drought concerns, Bush Brothers and 
Company took action to reduce their facility’s strain 
on limited water resources through a two-phase 
water reuse project.

Bush Brothers and Company’s facility biologically 
treats wastewater generated from bean rehydration 
and cleaning, batching of sauces, and plant 

sanitation operations. The treatment system utilizes 
multiple Evoqua dissolved air flotation units, and the 
water reuse system uses Evoqua’s reverse osmosis 
units for utility applications. The treatment system 
incorporates numerous sustainability benefits, 
including waste bean solids captured and used 
for cattle feed, biogas utilization for boiler fuel, 
land irrigation of treated water to replenish the 
water table, and reuse of treated water for non-
food contact utility applications. The technologies 
and processes implemented at Bush Brothers and 
Company are an excellent example of the ways in 
which water-intensive industries can maximize reuse 
and minimize environmental footprint.

Read the Bush Brothers and Company case study.
Read how Bush Brothers and Company leveraged Evoqua’s ADI-BVF® reactor to convert process 
wastewater into electricity.

The award recognizes excellence 
in water stewardship, including 
organizations using new or existing 
technologies in innovative and 
sustainable ways, and have made 
significant strides in water efficiency. 
Each year, this recognition is awarded 
on World Water Day. 

Bush Brothers and 
Company is proud to be 
selected by Evoqua for 
an award that recognizes 
the devotion that our 
people put toward creating 
a sustainable business, 
reducing our impact on 
the environment and 
improving our community.

PFAS and other emerging contaminants 
continue to drive complexity in water

to our water supply’s quality and safety. 
Removal of these contaminants is a 
mission-critical competency of Evoqua. 
In 2020, we supported the largest pilot 
in the U.S. to date to identify a treatment 
remedy for removing PFAS from 
groundwater. The water district installed 
30 liquid phase media adsorption vessel 
systems, using two different media 
types, to treat up to 86 million gallons 
of water a day. The new system provides 
clean, safe, and healthy drinking water 
to 2.5 million water district customers in 
Southern California.

SOLVING FOR MULTI-DIMENSIONAL 
SUSTAINABILITY NEEDS IN A WATER 
TREATMENT SYSTEM

In Boise, Idaho, we helped a potato 
processor solve its energy, water 
treatment, waste, and strict environmental 
regulations through an anaerobic 
digestion system. We designed and built 
a 17 million gallon ADI-BVF® reactor for 
one plant. Another low-rate anaerobic 
BVF® reactor and aeration tank for a 
second plant location allowed the plant 
to achieve approximately 86% chemical 
oxygen demand rate of removal. One 
of the facilities has taken advantage of 
the biogas created from the anaerobic 
treatment to fuel a process boiler, helping 
to displace natural gas and operating 
expenses while creating a more circular 
system.

helps maintain the integrity of 

the biological sample. With two 
weeks to design the system, and 
four weeks to have the reverse 
osmosis, UV sterilizer, deionizer, 
and more on-site, we met the 
needs of delivering pure water for 
one million COVID-19 test kits per 
day.
Learn more about the project.

Force of Nature® (FON), a small 
appliance company, increased 
its production of EPA registered 
disinfectant system by almost 
tenfold due to the unprecedented 
demand created by the COVID-19 
crisis. This system converts salt, 
water, and vinegar into hypochlorous 
acid, utilizing titanium mesh anodes 
coated with platinum metal oxide and 
titanium mesh uncoated cathodes, 
produced by Evoqua's Magneto 
anodes division. These systems have 

helped thousands of households 
easily and inexpensively produce an 
effective EPA registered disinfectant 
without leaving their homes or 
worrying about running out. Evoqua 
has been proud to work with FON 
for over eight years, since the initial 
concept stage, and delivered almost 
one year's production of electrodes 
for these systems in just four weeks.

Highlights From 
Our Operations

CHEMICAL RECIPE OPTIMIZATION FOR RESIN REGENERATION

Resin regeneration is already a circular 
concept, and we are now making it even 
more efficient.

In late FY19, we redesigned our light 
industry resin regeneration composition 
to see if we could reduce the processes 
chemical consumption. Throughout FY20, 

we implemented a change in the process, 
which allows us to cut our chemical usage, 
on average, by 10%. This provides year-
over-year cost savings while maintaining a 
high-quality product for our customers and 
will enable us to be more efficient in our 
resource consumption.

INNOVATION IN BEST PRACTICES

Resin is a type of media used to remove 
contaminants from water. Regeneration 
plants 'clean' ion exchange resin by 
processing it in large pressure vessels using 
chemicals and water. After regeneration, 
the resin is removed from the vessels 
and put into service bottles sent to our 
customers' facilities. Since this process 
can be water and time-intensive, our 
team designed a new station to more 
efficiently complete this process and reuse 
water from our service tanks. In FY19, our 
Indianapolis, IN, resin regeneration plant 
piloted the first mix bed automated fill 
station. 

The automated fill station can fill, pressure 
and flow check, and quality test the mix 
bed resin tanks using sensors, actuators, 

and a programmable logic controller. Water 
reuse plumbing was also incorporated into 
the system to increase efficiency. In FY20, 
this system was rolled out to two additional 
Evoqua facilities. 

The system allows for more than 80% of 
the clean deionized water to be reclaimed 
for reuse during our regeneration process. 
The system saves time and improves 
employee health and safety since the 
process requires less interaction and tank 
movement. 

In FY21, we will expand the new stations to 
two additional Evoqua facilities. We are also 
designing a separate bed resin automated 
fill station, which will be introduced at four 
Evoqua regeneration facilities.

Inclusion and  
Diversity

OVERVIEW

At Evoqua, we believe inclusion enables 
diversity to thrive. In FY20, we created 
an Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) strategy 
and reviewed it with multiple internal  
stakeholders. Our strategy focuses on 
creating a sense of belonging where we 
promote inclusion and spark opportunities. 
This focus on inclusion is what will help 
ensure positive outcomes are achieved. 

Upon reviewing the percentage of 
employees that fall into diverse groups, we 
will be focusing our FY21 diversity program 
on gender, U.S. minorities, and military 
veterans. We have put actions in place to 
continuously strive for greater inclusion in 

our organization. A significant portion of 
our effort is consciously determining who 
we bring into the organization and how 
we do so. With that, we understand that 
the best way to increase our employee 
diversity rates is by focusing on our 
recruiting practices.

We have zero-tolerance for any type of 
discrimination or harassment across our 
global organization. We always embrace 
inclusion and demand equal and fair 
treatment for all employees regardless 
of status. This year, additional anti-
discrimination training  was added to our 
Manager Academy program.

diversity-focused program

•  Ensure diversity is represented on interview 
panels when hiring senior leadership roles

• 

Implement a supplier diversity initiative

•  Embed inclusion and diversity principles into

Learning and 
Development

At Evoqua, we believe there is no one-size-
fits-all approach to development and that 
most learning happens in the workplace. 
Through our programs such as Leading at 
Evoqua, internships, apprenticeships, co-
op, and Leadership Development Program, 
employees and emerging talent learn new 
skills and gain experience they can leverage 
throughout their careers. 

New in FY20, the Learning and 
Development Team took a more specialized 
approach to learning. Employees were 
assigned online curriculum from our 

centralized learning platform that was 
most relevant to them. This improved the 
completion rates of our learning programs 
and ensured meaningful assignments 
reached each employee.

Throughout FY20, we continued to host 
opportunities to recruit emerging talent 
to our team. We hosted 46 internship, 
apprenticeship and co-op opportunities 
that supported projects to drive the 
success of our organization. These 
individuals gained exposure in operations, 
sustainability, and sales.

Supporting Our 
Communities

When we give back to our local 
communities, we are energized by 
the passion and dedication we see in 
our partners and employees. As an 
organization, we direct our corporate 
giving towards education, science, social, 

and humanitarian efforts, particularly those 
that satisfy our corporate objective to 
meet the needs for safe and clean water 
and sanitation. In this past year, response 
to COVID-19 was quickly recognized as an 
area of need.

#EVOQUAPROUD GIVEBACK PROGRAM

To raise funds for local communities 
impacted by COVID-19, we initiated 
an internal fundraising campaign by 
selling #EvoquaProud branded gear. The 
proceeds were donated to non-profits 
such as Feeding America, Water-4-Nations 
in Haiti, Mind in the United Kingdom, and 
Nature NB in Canada. These efforts helped 
provide access to out-of-school programs, 
meals for 12,660 families in need, and 
supplied 4,500 families impacted by 
COVID-19 with hygiene kits.

SUPPORTING LOCAL FOOD BANKS

In April 2020, national television caught 
glimpses of the lines of cars wrapped 
around Pittsburgh food banks as families 
sought support to put food on the table 
as the economic effects of COVID-19 hit 
home. Pittsburgh employees banded 
together to donate thousands of dollars 
to support these local food banks and 
community members in need.

Helping in the 
Sprint for Masks

Our wastewater treatment team based in 
Derby, United Kingdom donated a 3-D printer 
to assist a small local enterprise in creating 
900 face masks for healthcare workers on the 
front lines of COVID-19.

Water Education

As part of Evoqua’s World Water Day program, 
and before COVID-19 required us to cancel 
in-person events, Evoqua employees visited 
local schools to educate students on water 
sustainability and technology. Employees from 
Colorado Springs, CO headed to local schools 
to educate students about water use and 
sustainability, while Schaumburg, IL employees 
visited grade schools to conduct experiments 
and demonstrations on water chemistry and 
technology solutions.

Sustainability Highlights

OVERVIEW

Since our IPO in 2017, our Board 
of Directors has added three new 
independent Directors, and 70% of 
our Board is independent according to 
our Corporate Governance Guidelines 
and NYSE corporate governance 
standards. Our ten-member Board is 
chaired by an independent Director, and 
100% of the committee members are 
independent. Only three of our directors 
lack independence – our CEO and two 
Directors who are affiliated with our 
former private equity sponsor, AEA 
Investors LP.

The Board of Directors has the following 
standing committees: Audit Committee, 
Compensation Committee, and 

Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee. Our Directors are engaged, 
and the average attendance rate for 
meetings of the full Board and Audit 
Committee was 100%. The Compensation 
Committee's and Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee's 
average attendance meeting rates 
were 97% and 95%, respectively. Non-
management Directors hold executive 
sessions without members of Evoqua 
management present following most 
Board meetings. To continually improve 
our performance, the Board and each 
standing Committee conducts an annual 
self-evaluation. For additional information, 
please see our 2021 Proxy Statement.

The full Board of Directors has oversight 
of the company's sustainability 
priorities and the overall execution of its 
sustainability program.

compromising employee safety or the 
company’s integrity. Evoqua’s Compliance 
Helpline is managed by a third party and is 
available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a 
week. 

Our Employee Concern Policy ensures that 
anyone using the Compliance Helpline can 
report anonymously without fear of retaliation. 
Employee concerns are taken seriously, and 
the company is committed to investigating and 
responding to every report. The purpose of 
the Employee Concern Policy is to encourage 
employees to raise concerns internally for

persons or entities acting on behalf of Evoqua 
are held to the same high standards as our 
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. In

Supply Chain

We maintain a cost-effective, 
diversified procurement program 
through strong relationships with 
strategic suppliers across critical 
inputs. Our supply chain’s top acquired 
materials include metal, calcium 
nitrate, membranes, and ion exchange 
resin. We seek sources of supply from 
multiple suppliers and often from 
various geographies. We believe that 
our supply chain is well-positioned to 
remain stable.

We have a comprehensive, legally 
binding Supplier Code of Conduct 
for our suppliers that ensure we are 
partnering with businesses that share 
our mandate to respect international 
human and environmental rights and 
good business ethics. The procedures 
we have in place help us manage 
compliance-related issues associated 
with our vendors and business 
partners. We provide training to our 
employees on our monitoring program 
to vet and monitor our customers and 
suppliers.

We are dedicated to ensuring we 
respect human rights throughout our 
supply chain. We do this through our 

Supplier Code of Conduct, Code of 
Ethics and Business Conduct, Modern 
Slavery Statement, and Conflict 
Minerals Policy. 

We question our suppliers to ensure 
that they limit negative environmental 
impacts in their operations during 
our Supplier Code of Conduct 
and supplier onboarding process 
and require certification through a 
declaration in the Supplier Code prior 
to engagement. To assure that we 
engage only suppliers who follow 
fundamentally compliant and ethical 
business practices and share our 
commitment to these principles, we 
have a two-phased process in our 
Supply Chain Protocol. This includes 
an initial assessment that each supplier 
must complete and our supplier 
questionnaire, which is evaluated to 
determine if we will use their products, 
followed by a second assurance 
phase, our Compliance Requirement 
Auditing processes. We also monitor 
our suppliers and customers for 
major compliance incidents. We 
systematically monitor our suppliers for 
major environmental controversies. 

Supplier Focus 
in FY21

For FY21, inclusion and diversity within the supply 
chain will be a priority, specifically understanding the 
make-up of our current supply chain and increasing 
awareness of the need for diversity. In support of 
Evoqua’s core value of supporting the customer and 
ensuring supply chain continuity, we will also focus 
on our supply chain robustness. Identification of 
supply chain risks and facilitating alternative options 
is the prime objective. In FY21, we will integrate 
additional sustainability best practices into our 
supply chain management.

OUR RESPONSE 

We maintain a cost-effective and diversified procurement program focused on supply chain continuity and 
customer fulfillment, utilizing strong relationships with strategic suppliers across key commodities. The top 
materials in our supply chain include chemicals, membranes, resin, metal fabrications, carbon, and electrical 
components. The procurement strategy within the project environment is focused on ensuring our ability to 
meet individual customer needs, with particular focus on more complex installation projects. We seek to in-
source products that align with our existing manufacturing core competencies and that enable us to provide 
our customers with the highest level of value. Our diversified supply base spans across multiple suppliers 
and geographies, which we believe enables us to be cost-effective and responsive while also embracing our 
sustainability objectives. 

Below are relevant changes to our organization within FY20:

On October 1, 2019, we acquired a 60% investment position in San Diego-based Frontier Water Systems, LLC 
(Frontier). We have entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 40% interest in Frontier on or prior to 
March 30, 2024. Frontier is a pioneer in the development of patented, engineered equipment packages for high-
rate treatment and removal of selenium, nitrate, and other metals from complex water systems. Frontier is part 
of our Integrated Solutions and Services segment and broadens the portfolio of solutions that we offer to our 
customers through that segment.

On December 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Memcor low pressure membrane product line, including 
the product lines global workforce, its manufacturing site in Windsor, Australia, and associated operations and 
intellectual property, to DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (DuPont). Following the closing of the transaction, we no longer 
service the large municipal install base of Memcor products, which consists primarily of municipal drinking water 
and wastewater treatment facilities. We continue to sell Memcor products, which we purchase from DuPont for 
our industrial customer in our Integrated Solutions and Services segment.

On September 3, 2020, we acquired the assets of privately held Aquapure Technologies of Cincinnati (Aquapure), 
a Hamilton, Ohio based water service and equipment company. Aquapure serves the commercial and light 
industrial markets and provides customers with a variety of water treatment products and services, including 
deionization, reverse osmosis, softeners, and filtration systems. We expect this acquisition to strengthen our 
service capabilities in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the surrounding region.

In response to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic in the fiscal year, we have prioritized protecting 
the safety of our employees and stakeholders, taking actions to ensure the resiliency of our business, and 
managing the business for liquidity. Our business has been considered essential under federal and local standards, 
and, to date, we have maintained business continuity at our critical service branches and manufacturing facilities. 
We have taken measures to protect our employees, including implementation of remote working practices where 
possible and managing our supply chain to ensure that necessary personal protective equipment is available to 
our personnel.

Our Board maintains three standing committees, each comprised solely of independent, nonemployee 
members of the Board: 

The Audit Committee has oversight of the annual appointment and independence of our auditors, as well as 
the scope of audit and non-audit assignments and related fees; the results of the annual audit; accounting 
principles used in financial reporting; internal auditing procedures; the adequacy of our internal control 
procedures; related party transactions; and investigations into matters related to audit functions.

The Compensation Committee reviews and approves matters involving executive compensation, makes 
recommendations to the Board regarding setting of director compensation, authorizes equity and other 
incentive arrangements, and approves employment agreements and other employment-related arrangements 
for executive officers.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists our Board in identifying individuals qualified to 
become Board members, makes recommendations for nominees for committees and develops, recommends 
to the Board, and reviews our corporate governance principles.  

Our full Board is engaged in risk oversight both directly and through these standing committees. Our 
executive officers, also referred to as our “Executive Leadership Team,” include our President and Chief 
Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, President of the Integrated Solutions and Services 
Segment; President of the Applied Product Technologies Segment; Chief Growth Officer; General Counsel 
and Corporate Secretary; Chief Administrative Officer; and Chief Human Resources Officer. The Executive 
Leadership Team have principal authority and responsibility with respect to the day-to-day management and 
priorities of all aspects of Evoqua’s operations and programs.

In its oversight role, the full Board acts as a sounding board to the Executive Leadership Team in defining 
the sustainability priorities of Evoqua and the overall execution of its sustainability program. Evoqua has 
formed the Sustainability Steering Team, overseen by our Chief Executive Officer and other members 
of our Executive Leadership Team, to focus on five areas: social factors, corporate governance, internal 
environmental footprint, corporate social responsibility, and innovation. Under the leadership of the 
Sustainability Steering Team, we have begun executing environmental and social initiatives under our 
sustainability program via workgroups that are designed to help our customers improve their sustainability 
performance for water, energy and waste; lessen the environmental impact of our internal operations; help 
our employees, supply chain partners and communities thrive; and improve the communities in which we

OUR RESPONSE 

The Board of Directors, consisting of ten members, is the highest governance body at Evoqua. Our Board 
has affirmatively determined that seven of the ten members of our Board are independent directors as 
defined by the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and the corporate governance standards of 
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Ron C. Keating, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is not 
independent because of his position as an executive officer; and Brian R. Hoesterey and Vinay Kumar are not 
independent because of their affiliation with our AEA Investors LP. As of November 1, 2020, each of the Audit, 
Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board are composed entirely 
of directors of who meet the definitions of independence required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines 
and the NYSE corporate governance standards.

Our longest tenured directors joined our Board in 2014. Since 2018, three new directors have joined our Board.

Forty percent of our Board members self-identify as diverse, in terms of race, ethnicity or gender. Additionally, 
one Board member is a national of, and lives and works in, the United Kingdom. Our Board members range in 
age from 42 to 73; the average age on our Board is 59.5. In its oversight role, the full Board acts as a sounding 
board for the management of economic, environmental, and social topics. For more information on individual 
Board members please visit our Proxy Statement, pages 10-17 or evoqua.com/leadership. 

We currently separate the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. These positions are

as Chairman of our Board. The Chairman of the Board provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer, chairs 
Board meetings, sets the agendas for meetings of our Board and provides information to the members of 
our Board in advance of such meetings. As a result of this Board leadership structure, our Chief Executive 
Officer is able to focus on developing and implementing our company’s business strategies and objectives, 
and the Chairman is able to provide independent oversight of our company and serve as an independent 
liaison between our management and the members of our Board. For more information, please visit our Proxy

102-24 Nominating and selecting the highest 
governance body

OUR RESPONSE 

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists our Board in identifying individuals 
qualified to become Board members, makes recommendations for nominees for committees and develops, 
recommends to the Board, and reviews our corporate governance principles. A majority of the members 
of our Board are required to be independent. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
monitors the composition of our Board and its committees, identifies and evaluates potential director 
candidates, and makes recommendations to the full Board on these matters. The Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee considers the company’s strategy, business, and structure as well as 
input from our CEO on strategic priorities when developing a search for a director candidate. Additionally, 
under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, diverse candidates, including women and minorities, must 
be included in each pool of candidates from which we select new director candidates. Director candidate 
searches are conducted by a reputable, third party leadership consulting firm engaged by our Board. 
Potential candidates are evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, giving 
consideration to the types of qualifications, qualities, skills and other expertise we seek in all our directors, 
the needs of our Board, and other factors bearing on the candidate’s effectiveness as a contributor to our 
Board.

Please see our Proxy Statement, page 23 and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, page 2.

Our Board and each of its Committees conduct an annual performance self-evaluation under the 
framework established by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each member of our 
Board completes a written questionnaire covering various aspects of Board performance; similarly, each 
member of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees completes 
a written questionnaire soliciting feedback on the effectiveness of that Committee. Responses to the 
questionnaires are collected on an anonymous basis, and then compiled and summarized into a report 
by a third party. Each Committee and the full Board separately discusses the results of its performance 
evaluation in conjunction with the organizational meeting of our Board which is held following our Annual 
Meeting of Stockholders. For more information, please visit our Corporate Governance Guidelines or our 
Proxy Statement, page 24.

Our key stakeholders are customers, investors, employees, and community members.

102-41 Collective bargaining agreements

None of our facilities in the United States or Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements. As 
is common in Germany and the Netherlands, our employee populations there are represented by works 
councils. We are not involved in any material disputes with our employees and believe that relations with 
our employees and, to the extent applicable, with our works councils, are good.

102-42 Identifying and selecting 
stakeholders

Through our materiality assessment in 2019 we identified our key stakeholders and had the opportunity to 
create goals that fit their needs in accordance with our mission and values.

102-43 Approach to stakeholder 
engagement

Our employee engagement efforts include our weekly company-wide newsletter and frequent all 
employee town hall meetings, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to increase 
transparency, and employee engagement surveys through which we incorporate critical employee feedback 
into our culture, operations and strategic plans. Another employee engagement effort is our LIVE WELL 
programming, geared to promote worker health and well-being. Additionally, we conducted a materiality 
assessment in 2019, engaging a wide range of stakeholders, and we continue to undertake purposeful 
stakeholder engagement through our investor relations practices, our collaboration with our Board of 
Directors, customer questionnaires, focus groups and other activities. Our Compliance Helpline is available 
to all employees to report a concern. The Helpline is staffed by a third party and is available 24/7. Reports to 
the Helpline and submissions via the phone and internet may be made anonymously.

Found on page 25 of this report.

Evoqua’s EHS management system aligns with the basic elements of the ISO 14001:2015, and OHSAS 18001:2007. 
The multi-tiered governance and oversight structure of our global EHS program is designed to facilitate flow 
of communication throughout our entire organization regarding safety priorities, data trends and other critical 
matters. Our corporate EHS team closely monitors our program through monthly performance reviews at the 
executive level; our Chief Executive Officer and other leadership review every recordable accident; quarterly 
Operations Review meetings and Board of Director reports; daily interactions with operations’ leaders; routine 
reviews of key performance indicators; and regular facility audits to verify compliance. Our EHS management 
system covers all Evoqua employees. Our scope includes the major product and service categories associated 
with the primary functions of manufacturing water and wastewater treatment solutions at multiple locations 
and distributing the product to industrial, municipal, and commercial customers worldwide. Contractors, service 
providers, and visitors should be made aware of and conform to the EHS MS when engaged at work at Evoqua 
controlled facilities.

Through our Incident Report & Investigation Program, which includes executive oversight, we have established 
reporting procedures for work-related injuries and significant non-injury losses that are focused on: 1) Ensuring 
prompt medical care for injured employees, 2) Providing for accurate and timely reporting of incidents within 
the organization and to governmental agencies (as required), and 3) Providing management with the tools to 
determine the root causes of incidents, implement corrective and preventive actions to prevent their recurrence, 
and share this knowledge throughout Evoqua.

and communication on occupational

OUR RESPONSE 

We maintain an EHS program focused on work environments where each employee is enabled, empowered, 
and embraces personal accountability for protecting their health and safety, as well as that of their co-workers. 
Every employee is empowered to: 1) Perform a Safe Performance Self-Assessment when they begin work, 
2) Follow Standard Work Instructions for the job they are performing, and 3) STOP WORK when they have 
a concern or see the potential for injury. Information and resources can be found for workers on the Evoqua 
intranet site.

We pride ourselves on our ability to communicate our EHS management system with integrity and 
transparency to our employees. Details on the system are communicated via the Evoqua intranet site as well as 
through targeted programs and trainings. The majority of our sites have EHS committees that are responsible 
for investigating and reviewing accidents and communicating safety issues. All of our divisions hold monthly 
calls to review safety issues. Our operating guidelines and procedures are relevant for our industry.

In the United States and Canada, we rely upon our Daily Tiered Accountability Boards (TABs), Start of Shift 
Meetings, and Tool Box Talks, for employees to receive safety information and raise safety concerns. In EMEA, 
we rely upon our works councils, which consists of a network of people including HR, employee representatives, 
and operations management to address employee health and well-being. The manufacturing locations also 
utilize TABs. In APAC, we rely upon Safety Committees which are comprised of employees and management. 
Ultimately, employees have the ability to raise concerns through the Compliance Helpline.    

403-5 Worker training on occupational 
health and safety

We have implemented targeted programs to ensure employees receive initial training, followed by refresher 
training regularly. We also cover and reinforce hazard awareness for slips, trips and falls; strains and sprains; and 
body parts in the line of fire in our employee safety orientation, routine in-person and online safety training, 
safety alerts and messages, monthly safety calls, and our company-wide newsletters.

403-6 Promotion of worker health

The wellness of our employees is extremely important at Evoqua. We recognize that our employee’s good 
health and well-being not only allows them to out-perform in the workplace, but also to live a happy and 
rewarding life. We offer full health benefits, matching 401k, and an Employee Assistance Program. Beyond the 
traditional benefits, we think holistically about wellness. The mission of our LIVE WELL program is to create 
a work environment where employees have the tools, resources, and support system that will motivate and 
empower individuals to take responsibility for their health and live a healthier lifestyle. LIVE WELL’s pillars 
include: Move More, Eat Better, Be Safer, and Be Mindful. For more information on how we promote worker 
wellness please visit page 30 of this report.

403-7 Prevention and mitigation of 
occupational health and safety impacts 
directly linked by business relationships

To prevent occupational health and safety impacts, Evoqua relies upon our EHS applications. This is how 
we identify and track EHS issues to closure. These applications include employee observations, safety 
challenges in which hazards are identified and tracked to closure, reporting of safety incidents which leads 
to investigations and correctives which are also tracked to closure.

Further information on our approach to preventing or mitigating significant negative occupational 
health and safety impacts that are directly linked to our operations, products or services, our business 
relationships, and the related hazards and risks can be found in our EHS policy on page 25 of this report.
