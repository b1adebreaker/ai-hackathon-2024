Microsoft 2015 
Citizenship Report

Letter from Our CEO

Over the past year at Microsoft, we’ve challenged 
ourselves to rediscover what it is about the core of 
our company that really matters. How can we make 
a difference in this world in a way that no other 
company can? We’ve begun by embracing a new 
mission: to empower every person and every orga-
nization on the planet to achieve more. To achieve 
our mission, we’ve defined business ambitions 
that are equally bold: to reinvent productivity and 
business processes, to build the intelligent cloud 
platform, and to create more personal computing. 

The true test of the difference we make is the 
impact we have on people’s lives. This is why I trav-
eled to Nanyuki, Kenya, to celebrate the launch of 
Windows 10. Nestled in the foothills of Mt. Kenya, 
125 miles north of Nairobi, Nanyuki is a place 
where sending an email or accessing the Web in 
the past required a five-hour walk to the nearest 
wireless hotspot. Now, an innovative technology 
developed by Microsoft researchers, one that takes 
advantage of underutilized television broadcast 
spectrum, is helping to provide low-cost Internet 
access to the residents of Nanyuki. In the novel “The 
Flame Trees of Thika” set among these same foot-
hills, Elspeth Huxley writes that “when the present 
stung her, she sought her antidote in the future.” 

That future is now brighter. This fall, I visited Latin 
America to learn how technology is being used to 
empower people and businesses across the region. 
In Toluca, Mexico, just outside Mexico City, I saw 
this firsthand at a YouthSpark-POETA center that 
offers people from underrepresented backgrounds 
access to digital literacy, computer science training 
and mentoring, and resources to seek employment 
and entrepreneurship opportunities. I met with 
students and young entrepreneurs who had been 
inspired to start their own businesses, and in turn 
apply those learnings to teach others, and it was a 
profound reminder of the impact we can have  
in the world.  

This report summarizes our work during fiscal year 
2015 to meet the high expectations that we have 
for ourselves and that our customers, communi-
ties and other stakeholders have for us. Highlights 
include our efforts to address climate change 
through an industry-leading internal carbon fee 
and new policies designed to ensure that our U.S. 
suppliers provide paid leave to their employees 
who handle our work. In addition, in FY15, we made 
more than $922 million in technology donations to 
more than 120,000 nonprofit organizations globally, 
and Microsoft employees contributed $117 million 
to nearly 20,000 nonprofits through our corporate 
giving campaign.

To really make a difference, it’s not enough to 
build great products and services. Living up to our 
mission also depends on how well we apply our 
technology, talent and financial resources to foster 
opportunity and serve the needs of communities 
around the globe where our employees, partners 
and customers live. We recognize that our ability 
to pursue these goals requires that we conduct 
our business with integrity, with respect for human 
rights, and in ways that promote environmental 
sustainability. 

We’re particularly proud of our efforts to increase 
access to education and opportunity for young 
people. This year we surpassed the three-year 
goal for our YouthSpark initiative by creating 
opportunities for education, employment and 
entrepreneurship for 307 million youth worldwide. 
Over the next three years we are committing $75 
million to the next generation of our YouthSpark 
initiative to increase access to computer science 
education for all youth worldwide, especially those 
from under-represented backgrounds.

As I’ve shared with Microsoft employees, I believe 
we can do amazing things when we come together 
with a clear mission and a culture that brings  
out the best in us as individuals and collectively.  
Microsoft’s citizenship commitments help us 
ensure that what we accomplish together not only 
advances our business but also ultimately increases 
the positive impact we have in places like Nanyuki 
and Toluca and everywhere we do business around 
the world. 

Sincerely,

Satya Nadella
Chief Executive Officer

More than 99 percent of Microsoft employees completed 
annual training on our Standards of Business Conduct, 
which is available globally in 19 languages.

Microsoft’s total annual giving surpassed $1 billion for the 
second year in a row, with cash donations of $135 million and 
in-kind donations worth $922 million.

Our People

We surpassed the 3-year goal for our YouthSpark initiative 
by creating opportunities for education, employment, and 
entrepreneurship for 307 million youth worldwide.

Eighty-four percent of employees polled said they would 
recommend Microsoft as a great place to work.

Human Rights 

The percentage of minorities in our global workforce grew 
from 39 to 41 percent and the percentage of Microsoft 
senior executive women and minorities increased from 
27 to 30 percent.

Microsoft maintained our active membership in the 
Global Network Initiative, a collaborative effort regarding 
practical steps and policies technology and communication 
companies can adopt to respect and advance the freedom 
of expression and privacy rights of their users when faced 
with government demands. We were also the first major 
cloud provider to gain independent verification for meeting 
the world’s first international standard for cloud privacy.

In working to protect the rights of vulnerable populations, 
we launched a free cloud-based version of PhotoDNA, 
to further increase access to this technology used to help 
identify and remove child sexual abuse images from 
the Internet.

In FY14, we completed 314 third-party audits and Microsoft 
assessments of 138 Tier 1 and high- and medium-risk Tier 
2 hardware suppliers. Critical/serious nonconformance 
findings are detailed in this report. In all of these instances, 
the suppliers instituted corrective action plans that were 
approved by Microsoft, and follow-up audits confirmed that 
the suppliers were implementing the corrective action plans.

We continued to expand our work with our hardware 
suppliers to build their capabilities on environmental health 
and safety management and to improve factory workers’ 
living environments.

We also continued to enhance our work to advance 
responsible sourcing with our non-hardware suppliers, 
including new policies designed to ensure that our U.S. 
suppliers provide paid leave to their employees who 
handle our work.

Environmental Sustainability 

We met our carbon neutrality commitment through  
internal efficiency projects, the purchase of more than  
3 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of renewable energy  
(equal to 100 percent of our global electricity use), and  
a carbon offset project portfolio representing more than 
600,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

1.2 Citizenship Governance

Microsoft’s citizenship mission is to serve globally the needs of communities and to 
fulfill our responsibilities to the public. In doing so, we seek to apply the power of 
our corporate policies and business practices, our products, and our investments in 
communities to advance our company mission to empower every person and every 
organization on the planet to achieve more.

The charter for the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of our Board 
of Directors includes the responsibility to “review and provide guidance to the 
board and management about the company’s policies and programs that relate 
to corporate citizenship, including human rights, environmental sustainability, 
corporate social responsibility, supply chain management, charitable giving, and 
political activities and expenditures.” It does so on a semi-annual basis.

Microsoft’s Citizenship and Public Affairs team  
sits within our Legal and Corporate Affairs Group 
and drives initiatives and engages with groups 
across Microsoft to help the company fulfill its 
responsibilities as a global corporate citizen 
and deliver added value to the company and 
its stakeholders. This team of 30+ professionals 
develops our global citizenship strategies and 
works in partnership with local Microsoft citizen-
ship and corporate affairs professionals around 
the world to advance our citizenship commitments 
wherever we do business. The General Manager 
of Citizenship and Public Affairs reports directly to 
Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and General 
Counsel, who sits on CEO Satya Nadella’s Senior 
Leadership Team. 

More broadly, citizenship at Microsoft relies 
on the combined efforts of all our employees, 
including colleagues in dozens of other leader-
ship roles, business and operational groups, and 
global subsidiaries. Together, they help identify 
emerging issues and societal challenges where 
Microsoft can add the greatest value, develop 
and implement new strategies and programs, 
and monitor our progress.

Stakeholder Engagement

To inform our decisions, we regularly communicate with thousands of  
stakeholders globally ranging from parents concerned about their child’s online 
safety to international human rights experts. These engagements take many forms. 

Employees from our business and operational 
groups regularly identify and engage with stake-
holders in the course of their daily work activities. 
Our Citizenship and Public Affairs team also 
manages a number of stakeholder relationships 
and ongoing dialogues to help inform and guide 
our strategies. We connect with leading thinkers 
on corporate responsibility and societal challenges 
in groups such as Business for Social Responsibility,  
CSR Europe, and the World Economic Forum. 

We learn from them and other advocacy groups, 
socially responsible investors, corporate responsi-
bility rating agencies, other external stakeholders, 
and our own employees to identify new and 
emerging citizenship issues. We also base our 
work on international frameworks such as the 
United Nations Global Compact, the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, and  
the Global Reporting Initiatives’ Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines.

Stakeholder Engagement Overview

Stakeholder Groups

Examples of Engagement

Selected Results

Customers

We gain insights from online feedback, support 
communities, product satisfaction surveys, usability 
studies, research forums, business account manag-
ers, and our customer service representatives. 

Customer feedback and insights underlie all 
of our decisions to enhance existing products 
and develop new ones. In FY15, the Windows 
Insider program reached 5 million customers 
to allow them to preview Windows 10 and 
provide feedback, which helped shape key 
features of the product. Customer feedback 
also plays an important role in helping us 
develop clearer and more customer-friendly 
contracts and terms of use policies.

Stakeholder Groups

Examples of Engagement

Selected Results

Investors

Beyond traditional investor communications such as 
earnings calls and our annual meeting, we seek to 
proactively provide investors with corporate gover-
nance information through diverse communications, 
including a director video interview series and direct 
communications from independent members of 
our board to shareholders. We proactively reach out 
to institutional investors—including public pension 
funds and socially responsible investors—about 
governance and citizenship-related topics, and 
deliver a summary of their feedback to the board. In 
FY15, these engagements reached investors holding 
over 40 percent of our outstanding shares. We 
seek to transparently provide information sought 
by socially responsible investors and corporate 
responsibility rating agencies and seek their insights 
to identify new and emerging citizenship issues. 

Our engagement with investors has 
influenced many important parts of our 
citizenship strategy, such as our human 
rights commitments under the Global 
Network Initiative, a collaborative effort 
between information and communications 
technology (ICT) companies, human rights 
groups, socially responsible investors, and 
others. Investors are an important influence 
as we continue to consider ways to enhance 
our corporate governance principles 
and policies to serve the interests of our 
shareholders and other stakeholders.

Employees

Suppliers

Communities

We ask for—and act on—employee feedback in 
multiple ways, including conducting an annual online 
anonymous poll of all our employees around the 
world. The poll, with a nearly 85 percent response rate, 
asks employees to share feedback about the Microsoft 
work experience, including how they feel about their 
workgroups, organization, and company as a whole. 
Microsoft offers employees, customers, suppliers,  
and other external parties multiple ways to report 
compliance concerns as described in our Ethical  
Business Conduct and Governance chapter. 

We engage with suppliers through capacity-building 
workshops and trainings, supplier advisory boards, 
hosting an annual supplier summit, and participation 
in industry coalitions, such as the Electronics Industry 
Citizenship Coalition. We also conduct anonymous 
Voice of the Supplier Surveys, which include questions 
on citizenship issues.

Microsoft’s local citizenship teams work directly with 
community groups and in partnerships with local non-
profits. They share views and insights from local com-
munities with Microsoft’s global Citizenship and Public 
Affairs team in direct communications, through regular 
conference calls, and at an annual global summit.

Microsoft’s YouthSpark Initiative and 
Office 365 for Nonprofits program 
were both strongly shaped by input 
from local communities about the 
best way to serve economic and social 
needs in their area.

Microsoft’s Senior Leadership Team 
and individual managers use the poll 
results to further improve on areas of 
strength and address opportunities 
for improvement.

Industry coalitions 
and public-private 
partnerships

Microsoft actively participates in industry coalitions to 
address important citizenship issues and in many cases 
is among the leaders bringing companies together to 
work collaboratively to solve challenges.

Civil society / 
nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs)

Across the breadth of our business, we engage 
with thousands of NGOs working on issues ranging 
from environmental sustainability to employee 
diversity to child safety.

Our work to address environmental 
and social issues in collaboration 
with our suppliers is detailed in the 
Responsible Sourcing chapter.

Microsoft has helped establish  
groups that help set the standard  
for responsible business practices in 
the ICT industry, ranging from the 
Electronics Industry Citizenship 
Coalition and Global Network Initiative 
to the International Association of 
Accessibility Professionals.

Virtually all of the initiatives described 
throughout this Citizenship Report 
have benefitted from insights provided 
by NGOs and in many cases involve 
active ongoing partnerships with them.

Policymakers

Microsoft engages actively in policy issues relevant 
to our business, both directly and through industry 
associations. We seek to ensure that our participation 
in the political process takes place in the light of day 
and for reasons that are clear and justifiable to our 
shareholders and the public.

Microsoft is recognized as a leader 
for policies that help to ensure the 
accountability and transparency 
of our engagement in the public 
policy process.

Citizenship Materiality Assessment

To apply the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to 
our citizenship materiality assessment, we follow the common practice of defining 
our most significant citizenship issues as those ranking highest both in business 
importance to Microsoft and in importance to our key stakeholders.

This aligns with how we set our citizenship  
strategies and commitments to drive both  
positive impacts to our business and to society. 

Citizenship Materiality Assessment: Top Issues 

•  Access to technology and economic 

opportunity

Following are the top citizenship issues we identi-
fied using this approach. It reflects input gathered 
from our stakeholder engagement processes 
described in the previous section, consultation 
with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and 
other external experts, and consideration of the 
impacts of Microsoft’s core business priorities.

•  Climate change and energy

•  Corporate governance

•  Data privacy and security

•  Device lifecycle impacts

We recognize that our citizenship commitments 
have always played an important role in enabling 
Microsoft’s business success, but perhaps never 
more so than now. Microsoft is in the midst of a 
transformation into a productivity and platform 
company that will thrive in the mobile-first, cloud-
first world. As we explain in depth in our annual 
report, key elements of this vision include creating 
more personal computing, building the intelligent 
cloud, and reinventing productivity and business 
processes. Our citizenship commitments and the 
effective management of these top issues play an 
important part in earning and keeping the trust 
of our customers and other stakeholders and our 
ability to realize our long-term business strategy.

•  Environmental/social applications of technology

•  Ethical business practices

•  Human capital (or talent management and 

development)

•  Human rights

Commitment to Ethics and  
Standards of Business Conduct 

Building a fabric of trust is paramount to realizing our mission to empower every 
person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This means winning 
and preserving the trust of our customers, partners, and governments around the 
globe. We work to build and maintain trust through a shared commitment to ethical 
behavior and by acting with integrity in everything we do.

Microsoft regularly interacts with customers, partners, competitors, shareholders, 
suppliers, representatives, regulatory agencies, and government officials. We are 
committed to engaging all of these groups in a respectful, ethical manner and in 
compliance with all legal requirements.

Establishing trust in our complex and dynamic 
world starts with our culture—how we work, what 
we value, how we interact with others. The foun-
dation of our ethical culture is our commitment to 
integrity, honesty, and principled behavior in every 
situation and challenge we face.

our organization, and foster responsible  
decision making. We are proud that because  
of our commitments and actions, we’ve been  
on the Ethisphere Institute’s list of the World’s 
Most Ethical Companies every year since they 
began issuing the list in 2011.

Our commitments to ethical business practices 
and strong corporate governance policies are 
designed to promote the long-term interests of 
our shareholders, maintain internal checks and 
balances, promote accountability at all levels of 

Microsoft’s Standards of Business Conduct are 
the foundation of our commitment to ethical 
business practices and legal compliance. These 
standards are endorsed by the Microsoft Board 
of Directors and apply to all employees, directors, 
and executive officers of Microsoft and its subsid-
iaries and controlled affiliates (where Microsoft 
directly or indirectly owns more than 50 percent 
of the voting control).

All Microsoft employees must complete annual 
training on our Standards of Business Conduct. 
The training course is available in 19 languages. 

In FY15, as in previous years, we achieved a  
completion rate for the course of greater than  
99 percent. In addition, a variety of mandatory 
role-specific trainings address the compliance risks 
of particular business functions, and Microsoft 
provides employees with a wide range of addi-
tional optional training and guidance to ensure 
awareness of our policies and expectations for 
ethical behavior. The following graphic from the 
Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct reflects 
our straightforward approach and encourages 
employees to consult with internal resources  
when necessary.

2.2 Commitment to Ethics and  

Standards of Business Conduct 

Business Conduct and  
Compliance Program

Microsoft’s Office of Legal Compliance is respon-
sible for our Business Conduct and Compliance 
Program, working closely with the rest of Microsoft 
Legal and Corporate Affairs, Finance, Human 
Resources, Internal Audit, and other groups 
focused on ensuring compliance. We have more 
than 50 people whose primary role is investigat-
ing potential breaches of company policy, and an 
additional 120 people whose primary role is com-
pliance. In addition, we sometimes retain outside 
law firms to conduct or assist with investigations. 
This is a reflection of the size and complexity of 
our business and the seriousness with which we 
take meeting our obligations.

Across Microsoft’s business, we build and monitor 
internal controls to identify and mitigate risks of 
unethical and non-compliant conduct, perform 
regular internal audits, require multiple levels of 
approval for contracting and expenditures, and 
maintain internal compliance scorecards that 
affect key leaders’ performance compensation. 

Our responsibility is to take steps to train our 
employees, to build controls to prevent and  
detect unethical and non-compliant conduct,  
and when we identify or learn of concerns or 
improper conduct, to investigate them fully  
and take appropriate action to remediate.

Microsoft offers employees and external parties 
multiple ways to report compliance concerns. 
These include the following:

•  Calling a toll-free telephone integrity hotline 

that is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by 
a third-party vendor (operators are available 
to receive calls in 49 languages).

•  Submitting an online report through a publicly

Example of Microsoft Guidance  
to Employees on Making Ethical Decisions

We expect you to be well informed and exercise good judgment 
when making business decisions for Microsoft. Before making a 
business decision, ask yourself the following questions:

Is it consistent with 
our core values and 
the Standards?

We expect you to think 
through the issues and to 
use available resources 
to help, including our core 
values and the Standards.

Is it legal?

We are not expecting 
you to be a lawyer or legal 
expert. We do expect 
you to ask questions and 
seek guidance if you 
are not sure.

Am I comfortable with 
others finding out 
about my decision?

If you would not be 
comfortable sharing your 
decision with friends, 
family, and co-workers, it 
probably is not the right 
thing to do.

If you cannot answer “yes” or you are not sure, do not make the  
decision or take the action until you get additional help and guidance.

2.2 Commitment to Ethics and  

Standards of Business Conduct 

Preventing retaliation is critical to the Business 
Conduct and Compliance Program. Microsoft 
maintains and communicates an open-door p 
olicy and strictly prohibits retaliation against 
complainants who raise a compliance concern in 
good faith. Microsoft is committed to handling all 
inquiries discreetly and preserving the confidenti-
ality of anyone requesting guidance or reporting  
a possible violation to the extent possible and 
within the limits allowed by the laws.

Anti-corruption

Microsoft’s Standards of Business Conduct and 
Anti-Corruption Policy for Representatives 
include strong commitments to observing the 
standards of conduct set forth in the US  
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the applicable 
anti-corruption and anti-money laws of all the 
countries in which we operate. We prohibit cor-
ruption of government officials and the payment 
of bribes or kickbacks of any kind, whether in 
dealings with public officials or individuals in the 
private sector. We require partners to provide 
anti-corruption training to all employees who 
resell, distribute, or market Microsoft products or 
services and provide them a free, online training 
course available in multiple languages. Microsoft’s 
Supplier Code of Conduct also includes strong 
ethics and anti-corruption provisions, which are 
highlighted in an online Supplier Code of Conduct 
Training that suppliers must take. These are both 
available in 33 languages.

Beyond clearly communicating our expectations, 
Microsoft vets third-party representatives and 
certain suppliers to help ensure that we only 
engage those that are legitimate businesses with 
a reputation for integrity. We conducted a risk 
assessment to identify higher-risk representative 
types, which were then vetted along with many 
other lower-risk representative types. This includes 
channel partners, consultants, lobbyists, and 
other third parties engaged by Microsoft and 
its subsidiaries and joint ventures worldwide. In 
addition, we continue to have third-party reviews 
conducted for all new suppliers. Since the vetting 
program’s inception, Microsoft has screened nearly 
100,000 representatives and suppliers to enable 
Microsoft to monitor the risk profile and drive risk 
mitigation efforts accordingly.

2.3 Corporate Governance

Corporate governance at Microsoft is designed to promote the long-term interest 
of our shareholders, maintain internal checks and balances, strengthen management 
accountability, engender public trust, and foster responsible decision 
making and accountability.

Among the responsibilities of the Regulatory  
and Public Policy Committee is reviewing and  
providing guidance to the Board and manage-
ment about the Company’s policies and programs 
that relate to corporate citizenship, including 

human rights, environmental sustainability, 
corporate social responsibility, supply chain 
management, charitable giving, and political 
activities and expenditures.

Role and Structure of  
the Board of Directors 

Through oversight, review, and counsel, 
Microsoft’s Board of Directors establishes and 
promotes Microsoft’s business and organizational 
objectives. The board oversees the company’s 
business affairs and integrity, works with manage-
ment to determine the company’s mission and 
long-term strategy, performs the annual CEO 
evaluation, oversees CEO succession planning, 
establishes internal control over financial 
reporting, and assesses company risks and 
strategies for risk mitigation.

The board routinely reviews evolving practices to 
determine those that will best serve the interests 
of our shareholders. Microsoft is a leader in  
adopting standards to increase accountability 
to our shareholders, including early adoption of 
majority voting for board directors, Say on Pay 
advisory votes on executive compensation, and 
most recently, a proxy access bylaw. 

Microsoft’s Board of Directors maintains four 
standing committees to assist it in discharging its 
oversight responsibilities: an Audit Committee, 
a Compensation Committee, a Governance and 
Nominating Committee, and a Regulatory and 
Public Policy Committee. Only independent direc-
tors serve on these committees. Each committee 
has duties assigned by the board in compliance 
with Microsoft’s Bylaws and committee charters, 
which are available online.

2.3 Corporate Governance

Shareholder Engagement 

We seek to proactively provide investors with  
corporate governance information through 
diverse communications, including a director 
video interview series and direct communica-
tions from independent members of our board to 
shareholders. In 2009, we began posting video 
interviews with members of the board of directors 
to provide deeper insights into their backgrounds 
and perspectives on board service. In May, we 
posted our most recent interview with Mason 
Morfit, a Microsoft board member since 2014  
and president of ValueAct Capital. During the 
conversation, Mason speaks about his background 
at ValueAct Capital, his views on Microsoft’s 
leadership, and where he thinks the company is 
headed next. He also offers a behind-the-scenes 
view of how the board operates, and talks about 
the importance of shareholder engagement.

Our board video series, Microsoft on the Issues 
blogs, and annual letter from the Governance and 
Nominating Committee of the board are a few 
examples of our investor outreach efforts. With 
over 3.4 million shareholders, these are examples 
of one-to-many communications that provide the 

scale to reach all of our shareholders. Our Investor 
Relations website and its Governance & Citizen-
ship tab take the same approach.

We use a variety of other methods to engage  
with our shareholders. Over the past year,  
independent members of our board and members 
of senior management conducted outreach to a 
cross-section of shareholders owning approxi-
mately 40 percent of outstanding shares. Senior 
members of our management team also speak 
with our shareholders and provide the feedback 
received directly to our board. Our CEO, Satya 
Nadella, remains committed to investing time with 
our shareholders to increase transparency and 
better understand their perspectives, including by 
participating in our quarterly earnings calls.

The following diagram shows our annual outreach 
efforts and corporate governance cycle.

Shareholder Outreach and Our Corporate Governance Cycle

Microsoft believes that effective corporate governance should include regular, 
constructive conversations with our shareholders. We actively engage with our 
shareholders as part of our annual corporate governance cycle described below. 

Spring

Summer

Fall

Winter

Our corporate gover-
nance cycle begins with 
reviewing governance 
best practices, regulatory 
developments, and our 
own policies and 
practices. This analysis 
informs the annual 
update of our gover-
nance framework and 
policies.

We communicate to our 
shareholders significant 
changes to our gover-
nance practices along 
with other developments 
at Microsoft. We speak 
with a cross-section of 
our investors holding 
a significant portion of 
our outstanding shares 
about this information 
and solicit input on 
topics that are important 
to them, which we 
communicate to the 
Board and incorporate as 
part of what we address 
in our proxy.

We publish our annual 
communications to 
shareholders and other 
stakeholders:

•  our annual report

•  proxy statement and

•  citizenship report

We speak again with 
investors about 
important topics to be 
addressed at our annual 
shareholders meeting. 
We then hold our annual 
shareholders meeting.

The cycle concludes with 
the annual Board and 
committee evaluations, 
which include consider-
ing feedback received 
from shareholders during 
the preceding year.

2.4 Public Policy Engagement

Corporate participation in the public policy process is an important and essential 
means of enhancing shareholder value and is fundamental to free and democratic 
societies. We seek to ensure our participation in the political process takes place
in the light of day and for reasons that are clear and justifiable to our shareholders 
and the public. Our public policy engagement is guided by a publicly available 
Global Public Policy Agenda, which outlines our policy positions on issues core 
to our business. 

Microsoft is recognized as a leader for policies  
that ensure the accountability and transparency 
of our engagement in the public policy process. 
During FY15, we received the third highest rating 
in the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political 
Accountability and Disclosure, which is compiled 
annually by the Center for Political Account-
ability and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center 
for Business Ethics Research at the University of 
Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business.

Microsoft has adopted Principles for 
Engagement in the Public Policy Process in 
the United States to address issues specific to 
the US political and fundraising system. Under 
those policies, we commit to disclose a semi-
annual list of election campaign expenditures, 
including financial and in-kind contributions by 
the company and MSPAC to candidates, political 
parties, political committees, and other politically 
active tax-exempt organizations, such as those 
organized under Internal Revenue Code section 
501(c)(4), as defined by applicable laws. To uphold 
our commitment to transparency of our political 
spending and contributions, we do not make 
corporate contributions to any non-candidate or 
non-party political committees organized under 

section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, which 
are formed solely to influence elections. We also 
make no independent political expenditures or 
electioneering communications, as permitted 
under the US Supreme Court’s Citizens United 
ruling, and we inform our trade associations that 
no Microsoft funds may pay for their independent 
expenditures or electioneering communications. 

The Political Engagement section of our 
Citizenship website provides our comprehensive 
disclosure of our political engagement policies, 
disclosure of our US political expenditures  
and contributions, and information on our  
policy-related trade association memberships.

2.5 FY15 Progress and FY16 Goals

Progress Against FY15 Goals

FY16 Goals

Goal: Engaging in cross-industry forums to help us identify 
and contribute to the development of best practices.

Goal: Maintaining or increasing dialogue between 
stakeholders and the company. 

In FY15, Microsoft’s Anti-Corruption Program Management 
Office helped lead the US Technical Advisory Group to create 
and represent the US position in the development of the 
proposed International Standards Organization (ISO) Anti-
Bribery Standard, through the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI). The standard, once finalized and published, will 
help prevent corruption by enabling companies to consistently 
create and evaluate anti-bribery programs, identify and 
remediate areas for improvement, and demonstrate program 
effectiveness. Microsoft is also engaged in promoting anti-
corruption initiatives among intergovernmental organizations 
and multinational companies through Microsoft’s membership 
in the World Economic Forum Partnership Against Corruption 
Initiative (PACI) as an industry partner.  

FY15 marked an especially active year for proactively 
consulting with institutional investors and other shareholders 
in the wake of leadership changes. We sought feedback and 
input from a broad range of our investors, including public 
pension funds and leaders among the growing number of 
institutional investors focused on environmental, social, 
and governance issues. With the publication of our 2015 
Citizenship Report, we also launched a new Transparency 
Hub to make it easier for stakeholders to quickly access 
and understand our broad range of citizenship-related 
disclosures. 

Goal: Continuing to enhance our corporate governance 
principles and policies to serve the interests of our 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 

Our annual corporate governance cycle begins with review-
ing governance best practices, regulatory developments, 
and our own policies and practices. This analysis informs the 
annual update of our governance framework and policies.  
Acting in line with Microsoft’s long-standing corporate 
governance philosophy, in August 2015 the Board adopted a 
new “Proxy Access for Director Nominations” bylaw.

Goal: Monitoring and implementing the regulatory and 
disclosure requirements adopted under the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

We expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to con-
tinue to adopt regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
These include disclosure of pay ratios, pay for performance, 
hedging, and executive compensation recovery. We previ-
ously implemented polices relating to hedging and executive 
compensation recovery and will monitor and implement any 
further requirements in these areas. We also filed our second 
annual Conflict Minerals Report in compliance with regula-
tions called for under Dodd-Frank.

•  Advancing a project to simplify policies and make it 

easier for employees to find and use policies.

•  Launching a campaign to increase employee knowledge 
and use of the Microsoft ethics hotline and escalation 
processes and to emphasize Microsoft’s zero tolerance 
policy for retaliation.

•  Continuing to enhance our corporate governance 
principles and policies to serve the interests of our 
shareholders and other stakeholders.

•  Continuing to implement new regulatory and disclosure 
requirements adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

3.1 Our Approach

Perhaps the most important driver of our success is culture. We fundamentally  
believe that we need a culture founded in a growth mindset. It starts with a belief 
that everyone can grow and develop; that potential is nurtured, not predetermined; 
and that anyone can change their mindset. Our leadership is focused on bringing 
out the best in people, so that everyone is bringing their “A game” and finding  
deep meaning in their work.

We strive to exercise our growth mindset every 
day in three distinct areas:

1.  Customer-obsessed. We learn about our 
customers and their businesses with a 
beginner’s mind and then bring solutions 
that meet their needs. We look to learn from 
the outside and bring that knowledge into 
Microsoft, while still innovating to surprise and 
delight our users.

2.  Diverse and inclusive. The world is diverse. We 
serve everyone on the planet by representing 
everyone on the planet. We seek to be open 
to learning our own biases and changing our 
behaviors so we can tap into the collective 
power of everyone at Microsoft. We don’t just 
value differences, we seek them out and invite 
them in. And as a result, our ideas are better, 
our products are better, and our customers are 
better served.

3.  One Microsoft. We are a family of individuals 
united by a single, shared mission. We build 
on the ideas of others and collaborate across 
boundaries to bring the best of Microsoft to  
our customers as one. 

Through Microsoft’s Global Human Rights 
Statement and as a signatory to the UN Global 
Compact, we’re committed to respecting all of 
the human rights described in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights; the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and 
Cultural Rights; and the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work. 2

In addition, our commitments to communicate 
respectfully with each other, to provide for 
diversity and equal employment opportunity 
at all levels of our organization, and to protect 
the safety and health of our employees are 
incorporated into the Microsoft Standards of 
Business Conduct described in the Ethical 
Business Conduct and Governance chapter. 

2  Those ILO principles are freedom of association and the effective 
recognition of the right to collective bargaining; elimination of all 
forms of forced or compulsory labor; effective abolition of child 
labor; and elimination of discrimination in respect of employment 
and occupation.

3.1

Our Approach

Microsoft’s global Human Resources team 
advances our policies and programs to recruit, 
retain, and develop exceptional people. This team 
includes groups focused on compensation and 
benefits, talent and organizational capability, and 
diversity and inclusion. In addition to a central 
team, HR professionals are embedded within each 
group in Microsoft to ensure that every employee 
has a clear point of contact and support on HR 
issues, from our executive managers to indi-
vidual contributors. At the end of FY15, Microsoft 
employed 117,354 people worldwide.

In FY15 we faced the challenge of responsibly 
managing reductions in our overall workforce of 
approximately 18,000 positions. This was driven by 
two goals: work simplification and Nokia Devices 
and Services integration synergies and strategic 
alignment. The reductions were spread across 
many different business units and many different 
countries. We sought to go through this process 
with the deepest respect for affected individuals 
and recognition of their service to the company. 
We offered severance to all employees, as well 
as job transition help in many locations. Around 
the world, we worked to ensure we followed local 
process and laws in each of the countries affected. 

We ask for—and act on—employee feedback in 
multiple ways, including conducting an annual 
poll of all our employees around the world. Our 
main annual global employee poll is conducted 
by a third-party vendor to protect employee 
anonymity. In FY15, nearly 85 percent of our more 
than 100,000 employees responded to the poll. 
The poll asks employees to share feedback about 
their experience working at Microsoft. Microsoft’s 
Senior Leadership Team and individual managers 
use the poll results to further improve on areas of 
strength and address opportunities for improve-
ment. We supplement the poll with additional 
quarterly “pulse” polls covering additional issues.

3.2 Compensation and Benefits

Microsoft offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract the world’s best 
talent in over 100 countries, and rewards people for great results. Our Performance 
and Development approach and rewards program applies to Microsoft employees 
globally at every level of the organization to the extent permitted by local law. 

Stock-based compensation is a key component of 
our rewards programs at Microsoft as it provides 
an ownership stake in the company’s success. Over 
85 percent of Microsoft employees are eligible 
for an annual stock award. In addition, 90 percent 
of Microsoft’s employees are eligible for a cash 
bonus. Bonuses focus on an individual’s business 
impact over the past year.

We offer a wide assortment of flexible benefits. 
Due to local law, local conditions, and employee 
preferences, some benefits vary by location, but 
following is a representative sample of the array of 
benefits we offer: 

• 

Industry-leading health insurance coverage in 
the US with no employee premiums; and best-
in-class medical and dental coverage in which 
Microsoft funds eligible employees’ Health 
Savings Account for tax-free savings for current 
or future medical expenses.

•  Family benefits including health coverage for 
spouses, dependents, and domestic partners; 
subsidy for nearby childcare programs and 
back-up care for children, adults, and elders; 
Flexible Spending Accounts for healthcare 
and childcare; onsite lactation facilities; and 
adoption assistance and adoptive parent leave.

•  Family and medical leave programs, including 
paid and unpaid maternity and paternity leave 
programs and personal and compassionate 
leave, subject to local laws. 

•  Paid time off (vacation and sick days) and paid 

sabbaticals for qualifying employees.

•  Flexible work programs, including flexible 

schedules, telecommuting, and  
job-sharing options.

•  Voluntary benefits including additional 

disability insurance and group legal coverage.

•  Voluntary retirement savings plans, 

including plans in which the company makes 
contributions (such as 401(k) Plan matches for 
US employees of 50 cents on every dollar up  
to 6 percent of employee contributions). 

•  Employee discounts and friends and family 

discounts for Microsoft products. 

•  Discount programs for shopping, dining,  

and travel.

•  Employee Stock Purchase Plan offering 

employees discounted shares of  
Microsoft stock.

•  Life insurance and accident insurance.

•  Commute options, including free or subsidized 
mass transit tickets, access to free employee 
shuttles, and on-campus bike shops and  
secure storage. 

•  Education assistance for eligible employees.

3.3 Global Diversity and Inclusion

For over two decades, our Global Diversity and Inclusion Office has evolved and 
enhanced the company’s diversity and inclusion initiatives to meet the changing 
needs of our workforce and business. We have a deep commitment to create an 
inclusive environment where all employees can do their best work. This commitment 
is anchored around strengthening our diversity and inclusion acumen, deepening 
leader and manager understanding of the diversity strategy and its value 
proposition, and increasing senior leader accountability for their diversity plans. 

We know that Microsoft, like the rest of the tech 
industry, must do more to fully reflect the diversity 
of the global population. As a result, this past fiscal 
year, we’ve put renewed focus and thought into 
advancing the diversity and inclusion agenda 
within the company. We developed and rolled out 
key priorities, resulting in our FY16 Global Diversity 

and Inclusion Strategy, which was reviewed and 
approved by our Board of Directors. This new 
strategy has four specific areas of focus: trans-
forming the culture, empowering our people, 
expanding our talent pipeline, and delighting  
our customers.

Building an Inclusive and 
Engaging Culture

Maximizing the contribution of every individual 
allows us to infuse diverse thought as a natural 
part of the way we innovate. With that in mind,  
we value accountability and learning as key 
ingredients to nurturing an inclusive culture.  
Our clearest sign of investment and commitment 
towards creating a more inclusive culture is the 
recent launch of a new mandatory company-wide 
online Unconscious Bias training. From our experi-
ence and the advice of industry experts, we 
identified the importance of recognizing and 
changing unconscious biases in the workplace as 
one of the key actions that will help us to modify 
mindset and behavior. Demonstrating leadership 
support for this training, our CEO Satya Nadella 
and his senior leadership team, along with their 
direct reports, participated in dedicated learning 
sessions and also conducted strategic planning  
on the business benefits of diversity. 

To ensure that completing this training is not a 
“check the box” exercise, we have created inclusive 
leader, manager, and employee learning paths to 
build on the training and other new programs that 
will advance our collective diversity and inclusion 
acumen. These interactive programs include the 
extension of the Unconscious Bias training using a 
live case study format that focuses on real-life, 
role-play opportunities to examine and understand 
unconscious biases that may shape communication 
style, decision making, and behaviors. 

More broadly, we are committed to integrating 
diversity and inclusion principles into meaningful 
aspects of all that we do: from our hiring processes 
to our pursuit of innovation in how we build 
products and technology—to the way we  
communicate with and reward our people.  
We’ve already started this integration with  
company-wide employee events such as our 
annual Hackathon, customer feedback loops,  
our focus on usage in the engineering teams,  
and in our performance management practices. 
Our Ten Inclusive Behaviors guide, shared upon 
completion of the Unconscious Bias Course, 
provides best practices for all employees to 
embrace and model.

3.3 Global Diversity and Inclusion

We’ve also embraced opportunities to advocate 
for public policies that foster diversity and inclu-
sion. In 1993, Microsoft became the first Fortune 
500 Company to provide same-sex domestic 
partnership benefits for Microsoft lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) employees.  
We also found that with regards to our LGBT 
employees and their families, there can be  
significant challenges in states or countries that 
don’t provide equal recognition for their marriage 
or committed relationships. For that reason, in 
January 2012 Microsoft joined other leading 
companies to support legislation in our home 
state of Washington that recognized marriage 
equality for same-sex couples. Since then, we’ve 
advocated for marriage equality in places where 
we have facilities and employees and will continue 
to support marriage equality when this issue arises 
in communities around the world.

Empowering Our People

Recognizing that “top talent” and “diverse talent” 
are not mutually exclusive populations, we will 
continue to make Microsoft the employer of 
choice for all great talent. And with that, we are 
more focused than ever on empowering our 
people through recruitment, retention, and career 
development. We have clear goals company-wide 
to increase global representation of women and 
ethnic minorities in the United States, particularly 
at more senior levels of the organization. Within 
our talent and recruiting organizations, we are 
sharpening our focus on diverse candidate 
pools—and in fact one of the metrics our recruit-
ing organization is measured against is how 
effectively it recruits from these pools. 

Each member of our senior leadership team is 
accountable for driving diversity and inclusion prog-
ress relative to how we attract, retain, and advance 
women and other diverse employees within the 
company. We’ve introduced and revised a number 
of rich developmental and on-boarding programs 
to support this effort. We continue to evolve our 
talent management practices by diversifying our 
candidate slates and implementing inclusive succes-
sion planning for senior diverse talent.

Expanding Our Pipeline of 
Talent and Leaders

In addition to our employee retention and career 
development strategies, expanding the pipeline 
of diverse talent for the tech industry as a whole, 
as well as for our company, is very important to 
us. We have developed specific programs around 
the cultivation of diverse talent which start with 
our high school internship programs and continue 
with our executive recruiting efforts. The follow-
ing are examples of some of our programs that 
directly address the shortage of diverse students 
graduating with science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM) degrees: 

•  For more than a decade we have championed 

DigiGirlz, now part of the Microsoft YouthSpark 
initiative, which gives girls aged 14 to 18 
the opportunity to learn about careers in 
technology, connect with Microsoft employees, 
and participate in hands-on computer and 
technology workshops. DigiGirlz programs now 
span 16 countries and have reached 26,000 
participants. A key sign that this program is 
having a positive impact is that some of the 
early participants have now graduated from 
college and joined Microsoft as employees. 

•  Blacks at Microsoft, an Employee Resource 

Group, hosts an annual Minority Student Day 
that provides local area high school students 
from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds 
with information about the tools, resources, 
and career opportunities that are available 
to them in information technology. It also 
awards scholarships to high school seniors and 
connects recipients with mentors throughout 
their college careers. The program has 
been successful in helping graduates find 
employment at Microsoft.

•  We’ve recently expanded our Explore Microsoft 

12-week summer internship program that 
strives to attract women and minorities into 
technical fields and to Microsoft. It is specifically 
designed to expose first- and second-year 
college students to software development and 
encourage students to pursue degrees in this 
and other related fields of study.

•  Our involvement with Code.org has enabled 
us to reach 52 million youth in the US in just 
the past 18 months, and through our TEALS 
program we reached 6,000 students in 131 high 
schools during the 2014–2015 school year.

3.3 Global Diversity and Inclusion

In addition to these investments, we are also 
broadening the spectrum of diverse talent sources, 
including deepening our commitment and invest-
ment in hiring people with disabilities. We recently 
invested in a new pilot program focused on hiring 
people with autism for full-time, Redmond-based 
Microsoft positions. We developed this pilot in 
partnership with Specialisterne, a social enterprise 
run by the Specialist People Foundation, which 
works to enable one million jobs for people with 
autism and similar challenges through social  
entrepreneurship, corporate sector engagement, 
and a global change in mind-set. 

Microsoft is also working to help diversify non-
STEM fields as well, such as the legal profession. 
In 2015 Microsoft partnered with other compa-
nies and law firms to launch the Gregoire Fellows 
Program in partnership with the University of 
Washington School of Law, to bring greater  
diversity to the school and improve the pipeline  
of diverse students to Washington state.  
The Fellows will receive summer internships,  
mentoring throughout their time in law school, 
and a scholarship to study for the bar.

Delighting Our Customers

When it is all said and done, having a diverse  
workforce—one that is a reflection of the richness 
of the customers around the world who buy our 
products, services, and technologies—is critical to 
our long-term business success. Our goal is to use 
diversity and inclusion to build products that  
customers need, choose, and love.

Our product development processes are evolving 
to become more inclusive and accessible than  
ever before. We have programs such as our annual  
Ability Summit and new Inclusive Design initiative 
that serve to enable more innovative and accessi-
ble products. Through these efforts, accessibility  
features and settings are built into Microsoft  
software programs. We have made significant  
R&D investments in accessible technology,  
including speech processing (for hard of hearing),  
speech synthesis (for speech impairment),  
eye-operated assistive technology and advanced 
wheelchairs (for ALS), and directional audio (for 
guide dogs).

Our Employee Resource Groups (ERG) repre-
sent many different segments of our population 
and serve as outreach mechanisms between 
diverse communities and Microsoft as a whole. 
These groups help support important business 
initiatives—from recruiting and retention to the 
marketing of Microsoft products and services.  
We work closely with our ERGs and Employee  
Networks to help make sure that the products  
that we’re creating actually work for the  
populations they represent.

Workforce Diversity Data

Our emphasis on diversity is not purely a conver-
sation about the numbers—it is as much a focus 
on our attitudes and behaviors as leaders that 
drive the numbers. That being said, it is important 
that we track and report on our diversity data—
which we do quarterly. While we have publicly 
shared our workforce data since 2006, in the fall 
of 2014 we began sharing even more specific 
data relative to our demographics via our Global 
Diversity & Inclusion website, including publish-
ing the EEO-1 data we report each year to the US 
government. The data confirmed that Microsoft, 
like the rest of the tech industry, must do more to 
fully reflect the diversity of the global population, 
and underlies the new approaches and commit-
ments we are making to make progress.

our commitment and focus on diversity and 
inclusion a truly integrated part of the company’s 

standard business practices. We are inspired by the 
opportunities that lie before us and believe that 
the diversity of our workforce and inclusiveness 
of our culture will continue to play a critical role 
in helping us deliver innovations that will bring 
ultimate value to our customers.

3.4 Training and Development

We believe that everyone can grow and develop; that potential is nurtured, not 
pre-determined; and that anyone can change their mindset. To support our 
growth mindset culture, we offer a diverse range of learning and development 
opportunities, including trainings available in the classroom, online, and through 
videos, mobile apps, podcasts, and other formats in multiple languages, to meet 
the learning needs of our employees around the world. We believe training is not 
limited to formal instruction and our training philosophy focuses on providing the 
right learning, at the right time, in the right way.

With training opportunities ranging from class-
room modules to peer-to-peer mentoring, no one 
metric captures the breadth of learning available 
to Microsoft employees, but globally we have 
found that in FY15:

•  91 percent of all employees were satisfied with 
the knowledge they gained and could apply to 
their job immediately with our formal training.

•  Our employees spent an average of 26 hours in 

formal training. 

We invest significantly in our employees’  
career development, provide on-the-job 
“stretch” opportunities for advancement, and 
offer frequent promotion opportunities, all of 
which are foundational to our culture. 

Throughout the year, employees get coaching  
on career development through meetings with 
their manager. Managers receive training to 
enhance their skills in coaching and mentoring 
employees on how to achieve the greatest impact, 
as well as how to drive their own career develop-
ment, providing tools and resources to support 
focused and actionable conversations. We also 
offer all new employees a robust new employee 
orientation that covers a broad range of topics  
to help set employees up for success from their 
first day at Microsoft. Orientation topics range 
from an overview of benefits, online resources, 
opportunities to engage in communities, to 
exploration of our company values, culture,  
and Standards of Business Conduct.

3.5 Employee Wellness and Occupational Health and Safety

Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being with  
comprehensive benefits to help employees maximize their physical,  
financial, and social wellness.

•  Healthy dining options, including a new 

Real Easy Wellness labeling system used in 
all Microsoft cafes with color coding to flag 
healthier and less healthy options.

•  Access for Microsoft employees and their 
dependents to weight management,  
tobacco cessation, and chronic disease 
management programs.

•  An onsite health clinic at our Redmond, 

Washington headquarters campus, offering 
comprehensive health and wellness services 
and clinics at some other locations.

These benefits include:

•  The Microsoft Ergonomics Program, offering 

employees ergonomic assessment and training 
programs and special furniture, equipment, and 
software for medical needs.

•  The Microsoft CARES employee assistance 
program, offering free access to services 
including personal and family counseling, stress 
management, and referrals for child/elder care.

•  Fitness benefits that fund gym memberships 

or fitness-related equipment and activities and 
onsite recreational and fitness opportunities.

•  Free onsite “Know Your Numbers” health 

screening events, providing employees and 
their adult dependents with screening for risks 
of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, 
and high blood pressure as well as onsite 
mammography screenings.

In addition to our wellness programs, Microsoft’s 
Health and Safety program integrates appropriate 
safety and health practices into our operations, 
and works for continual improvement in employee 
health and safety. As part of this commitment, 
health and safety professionals assess the safety 
risks of Microsoft work activities and engage with 
workers and management to implement safe  
work practices, hazard controls, and training 
to minimize safety risks. They also assess new 
workspaces as they are constructed and existing 
workspaces periodically to ensure sound design-
for-safety principles are followed and needed 
controls are implemented effectively. As part 
of this approach, Microsoft involves employees 
and managers in Health and Safety Committees 
specific to our datacenters, retail operations, 
and our manufacturing facilities.

Over the past several years, we have worked  
to enhance our capacities to protect employee 
health and safety as the diversity of our operations 
has grown and exposed our employees to new 
types of workplaces. As described in our Responsi-
ble Sourcing and Manufacturing chapter, we 
created a global manufacturing team of experts  
in industrial safety, occupational health, and 
environmental sustainability to work across  
Microsoft’s newly acquired device factories to  
align programs and priorities, ensure excellence  
in environment, health, and safety, and drive 
continuous improvement. In FY14, our metrics  
for occupational injuries and illnesses were com-
parable to or less than injury-illness rates from 
other companies with similar operations. Our US 
facilities had an Injury-Incident Rate of 0.14 and  
a Lost-Day Rate of 0.02 (our 12-month rolling 
average for July 1, 2013—June 30, 2014) based  
on US OSHA rules for recordkeeping).

3.6 FY15 Progress and FY16 Goals

Progress Against FY15 Goals

FY16 Goals

Goal: Continuing to advance our culture of working 
together to drive meaningful impact for our teams, 
business, and customers and to adjust our approach to 
Performance and Development programs, as needed, 
in response to employee feedback and evolving 
business needs.

In FY15, under the leadership of our CEO, our HR organiza-
tion worked with teams across Microsoft to explore, define, 
and foster a culture to help us achieve our mission and 
strategic goals. Our CEO has articulated his vision of 
culture in employee Q&A sessions and all company emails. 
Moreover, in FY15, we launched our first annual “//oneweek” 
Global Hackathon to bring together diverse individuals to 
collaborate on developing innovative new ways for Micro-
soft to do business and solve customer and social problems.

Goal: Continuing to offer industry-leading health care 
in the United States with no employee premiums and 
continuing to provide multi-modal educational materials 
to teach employees and their dependents how to optimize 
their health care and overall wellness.

We’ve maintained these benefits and continue to invest in 
preventative and life-optimizing wellness programs for our 
employees and in many cases their family as well.

Goal: Creating learning that supports our employees’ 
ability to adapt and lead in our changing company, a 
changing industry, and a changing world. 

We developed new learning opportunities on a range  
of topics from unconscious bias training to career  
development skills.

Goal: Driving innovation and efficiency by infusing 
diversity and inclusion into our business strategy and by 
developing innovative products and services to better 
serve the needs of a broad range of customers.

•  Recruiting and developing talent with world-changing 

capabilities.

•  Leading the culture transformation toward a growth 
mindset and helping drive behaviors to support the 
cultural attributes of diversity and Inclusion, customer 
obsession, One Microsoft, and making a difference.

•  Making Microsoft an exceptional place to work through 

rewards, work environment and perks, and a clear 
employee value proposition. 

Our Senior Leadership Team conducted strategic planning 
on the business benefits of diversity and has rolled out new 
strategies to gain business value from diversity and inclusion 
across core parts of our business.

•  Driving transformational leadership by elevating the 
value, accountability, and impact of leadership at 
Microsoft, including defining and driving leadership 
attributes that align to culture.

•  Helping Microsoft’s employees achieve more by 

transforming HR through data, technology, process 
excellence, and investment in our people.

4.1 Our Approach

Microsoft is committed to applying our technology, talent, and financial resources 
to empower communities around the planet where our employees, partners, and 
customers live and work. 

Our Citizenship and Public Affairs team devel-
ops and coordinates global strategies that are 
implemented through local citizenship teams and 
nonprofit partners to meet unique local needs 
and conditions. We focus our corporate philan-
thropy on two strategic areas that align with our 
business and where we can contribute our skills 
and resources to create meaningful impact. First, 
we seek to empower youth around the globe by 
connecting them with greater opportunities for 
education, employment, and entrepreneurship, 
with a particular focus on creating opportunities 
for all youth to learn computing. Second, we work 
at a global scale to donate technology to nonprofit 
organizations so they can do even more good. 

As a complement to our focused approach to our 
corporate philanthropy, our flexible volunteer and 
employee giving programs enable employees to 
support the causes they choose with donations 
of time, expertise, money, and software. Our 
employees regularly tell us a key factor behind 
their choice to work at Microsoft is knowing their 
personal commitment to philanthropy will be 
honored, encouraged, and matched.

We also work to use the full set of resources we 
can offer to nonprofits and communities beyond 
our contributions, product donations, and 
volunteer talent. For instance, we have active 
community engagement programs to organize 
and host nonprofit and community events at 

Microsoft Stores and a number of our facilities 
in cities around the world, such as the Micro-
soft New England Research and Development 
(NERD) Center in Boston. We frequently donate 
space for our nonprofit partners to hold meet-
ings and events in our facilities. We also extend 
our expertise in citizenship communications to 
nonprofit partners with trainings and resources 
on effective digital communications and use 
of social media. We also collaborate with key 
nonprofit partners on joint public relations and 
communications strategies to publicize their 
message on important causes.

For the second year in a row, our FY15 total annual 
giving surpassed $1 billion.

4.2 Microsoft YouthSpark

Microsoft YouthSpark is a global company-wide initiative to use the power of 
technology to connect youth around the world with education, employment, 
and entrepreneurship opportunities. We launched YouthSpark in 2012 with the 
specific goal of creating opportunities for 300 million youth by 2015. In FY15 we 
created opportunities for over 80 million youth and met our three-year goal, 
creating opportunities for more than 307 million youth in total. Going forward, 
we will continue our YouthSpark initiative with a sharpened focus on increasing 
access for all youth to computer science education on a global scale. The 
following are just a few of the programs that comprise YouthSpark.

Nonprofit Partners
To help close the opportunity gap for millions of 
youth around the world, Microsoft YouthSpark 
provides philanthropic contributions to more than 
400 youth-serving nonprofit organizations in more 
than 100 countries spanning the globe, including: 

•  The Anupdip Foundation for Social Welfare’s 

DREAM for Women program, which establishes 
women-run co-operatives in rural India and 
provides them technology and business  
skills training.

•  The Center for Digital Inclusion’s 68 

YouthSpark Centers across Brazil, Colombia, 
and Mexico, which provide technology and 
business skills trainings to help youth increase 
their opportunities for further education, 
employment, and entrepreneurship.

•  Silatech’s Youth Works Employment Initiative, 
a three-year program to empower one million 
Arab youth through training, job placement, 
and self-employment resources.

•  Junior Achievement’s Youth Enterprise Europe 
program that provides computer science and 
entrepreneurial educational trainings in 17 
European countries.

•  Code.org and the Hour of Code, which have 
introduced millions of K–12 students to 
computer science education with a particular 
focus on increasing participation by women 
and underrepresented students of color.

Office 365 for Education
Microsoft Office 365 is free for all students and 
teachers around the world and provides ready 
access to technology tools that power learning 
and collaboration: email, instant messaging,  
group video and voice chat, and online  
document viewing and editing.

Skype in the Classroom
Skype in the Classroom creates a free, global 
community for teachers to connect their students 
with other students and guest speakers from 
around the world.

Microsoft Digital Literacy Curriculum
Microsoft’s free online Digital Literacy curriculum  
is available in 10 languages that together are 
spoken by more than half the world’s population. 
The user friendly curriculum spans a broad range 
of technology skills at Basic, Standard, and 
Advanced levels. 

Computer Science Education—TEALS
Technology Education and Literacy in Schools 
(TEALS) pairs computer science professionals with 
classroom teachers to teach computer science in 
high schools across the country, either in-person 
or via Skype. Started in 2009 by a Microsoft 
employee who developed and ran the program in 
his spare time, TEALS was embraced and adopted 
by Microsoft in 2011. Doubling in size every year, 
in the 2014–2015 school year TEALS reached 6,000 
students in 131 schools in 18 states, and to date 
has helped teach more than 12,500 high school 
students introductory or advanced placement (AP) 
computer science with an industry-recognized 
curriculum developed by the University of California 
at Berkeley and the University of Washington. 
TEALS recruits volunteer technology professionals 
from Microsoft and across the industry. 

Microsoft Imagine
Microsoft Imagine connects aspiring student 
developers of all skill levels with the tools, 
resources, and experiences they need to turn their 
innovative ideas into reality, whether it’s building 
a game, designing an app, or launching a project. 
Imagine includes the Imagine Cup, Microsoft’s 
global youth technology competition, which 
challenges students to apply their knowledge and 
passion to develop technical solutions for social 
impact, engaging games, and driving innovation.

In developing Microsoft YouthSpark, we consulted 
with government, nonprofit, and business leaders 
globally to understand the challenges young 
people face in building their lives and contributing 
to their communities. This work highlighted the 
need to go beyond addressing the “digital divide” 
and to take a more holistic approach to address 
the opportunity divide—the gap between those 
who have the skills, access, and opportunities to  
be successful and those who do not.

As we reflect on our learnings and develop- 
ments during our first three years implementing  
YouthSpark, going forward, we are focusing 
YouthSpark on creating opportunities for all  
youth to learn computing—with a top priority on 
increasing access for all youth to computer science 
education on a global scale. As technology has 
become an integral part of people’s daily lives in 
nearly all regions of the world, we’re seeing a 
growing demand—from students, parents, teach-
ers, governments, and nonprofits—to teach youth 
not only how to use technology, but also how to 
create technology and become the innovators  
and drivers of growth and opportunity in their 
communities. 

The goal of computer science education is not, 
necessarily, for everyone to become a computer 
scientist or a software engineer. We believe that 
all young people should have access to com-
puter science education so they can learn this 
foundational subject matter and develop the 
computational thinking skills that will be critical for 
their future. In the coming years we will focus our 
YouthSpark philanthropy, youth programs, and 
policy advocacy to advancing this cause.

4.3 Technology for Good 

Microsoft helps build nonprofits’ capacity to use technology to be more efficient, 
effective, and innovative in doing their important work. In addition, in FY15 Microsoft 
donated software, services, and hardware—worth $922 million—to more than 
120,000 nonprofit organizations around the globe.

In FY15, we continued to expand our Office 365 
Nonprofit offer to reach a total of 110 countries. 
The program provides nonprofits with free access 
to the latest Microsoft Office cloud service, which 
includes anywhere access to Microsoft Office 
applications and professional email, calendar, 
instant messaging (IM), and web conferencing 
tools. The offering allows nonprofits’ employees 
and strategic volunteers to access Office applica-
tions and documents anywhere across multiple 
devices; enables easy collaboration through 
content sharing; and offers efficient administrative 
controls so organizations can spend less time and 
resources on IT maintenance. 

Through this program in FY15 we activated 1.09 
million new Office 365 seats among nonprofits.  
In its first two years, Office 365 Nonprofit offers 
have provided licenses for 2.7 million nonprofit 
employees and strategic volunteers. 

We also host NGO Connection Days around the 
globe for nonprofit organizations to learn how 
technology can help them become more efficient 
and effective in their work. In FY15, Microsoft 
collaborated with nonprofits by hosting 89 NGO 
Connection Days in 59 countries.

4.4 Humanitarian and Disaster Response

In times of disaster, and to prepare for those times, Microsoft and our partners 
contribute resources and technology solutions to assist governments and 
humanitarian organizations in their emergency response efforts. Microsoft’s  
Global Disaster Response Team includes experts from Microsoft Operations, 
Services, and Citizenship and Public Affairs to quickly deploy Microsoft technologies 
and technical assistance to customers, communities, governments, and nonprofits 
in the wake of natural disasters. The team also works to help organizations make 
technology systems more resilient to proactively prepare for disasters. We also help 
governments and nonprofits quickly identify and deploy the right technology to 
address the unique needs of a disaster situation. 

In FY15, Microsoft provided support to address a 
number of disasters around the world, including 
the spread of ebola in Africa, flooding in India,  
and a cyclone in the Philippines. In addition, we 
provided more than $13 million in cash, technol-
ogy, and in-kind support to help with the relief 
efforts necessitated by two major earthquakes  
in Nepal. After the devastation we saw in Nepal, 
we offered free calls in and out of the country  
via Skype. The Microsoft Innovation Center in 
Kathmandu trained student partners and sent 
them to local communities with Windows Phones 
to help people make Skype calls and connect  
with families, friends, and aid. Our Microsoft 
Consulting Services Team also provided a range  
of free technology services to agencies working  
on earthquake relief efforts in Nepal, including the 
United Nations Development Programme, Office 
of the Prime Minister, Nepalese Ministry of 
Finance, and the Nepal Police. 

For more information, see our Disaster Response 
Program website.

Outside the US, employees can take up to three paid 
days off to volunteer in their local communities. In the 
US, our Employee Giving Program matches employee 
gifts of money and time to nonprofits up to $15,000 
annually. In FY15, we increased our company volunteer 
match to $25 per hour so that, as an example, four 
hours of volunteer time results in a $100 donation 
from Microsoft to the nonprofit. In FY15, 67 percent 
of Microsoft’s US employees participated in the 
Employee Giving Program.

To encourage employees to volunteer, we maintain 
an extensive database of volunteer opportunities and 
host an organized Day of Caring for team-based group 
volunteer efforts for employees around the Seattle 
area and many of our other locations. We also actively 
recruit employees to participate as volunteer computer

5.1 Our Approach

Microsoft’s respect for human rights reflects our longstanding commitment to 
empowering individuals around the world. We work to ensure that we respect 
human rights across all aspects of our business, and we seek to apply the power 
of technology to promote human rights globally. 

Since endorsing the UN Global Compact in 2006, 
Microsoft has had a formal commitment to 
respecting all of the human rights enumerated  
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
International Covenant on Civil and Political  
Rights; International Covenant on Economic,  
Social and Cultural Rights; and ILO Declaration  
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 
Across our business we have a wide range of 
policies, practices, and programs that relate to 
human rights, including data privacy and security, 
free expression, labor rights in our workforce and 
our supply chain, and equality and diversity.

Building on these fundamental commitments, 
Microsoft was among the first companies to align 
our human rights work with the UN Guiding Prin-
ciples on Business and Human Rights released in 
2011. Microsoft’s Global Human Rights Statement 
articulates our human rights commitments in line 
with the framework of the Guiding Principles, 
including issues related to governance, due dili-
gence, and remediation. We have long included 
human rights topics in our citizenship reporting. 
Over the past year, we participated in a multi-
stakeholder process convened under the Reporting 
and Assurance Frameworks Initiative to support the 
development of the UN Guiding Principles 
Reporting Framework.  

We have worked to apply that framework to this 
year’s report and applied the stakeholder engage-
ment and materiality assessment processes 
described in Chapter 1 to determine what the 
framework terms “salient” human rights issues to 
include. This chapter covers many of those salient 
issues: privacy and data security; our commitments 
to the Global Network Initiative principles on 
freedom of expression and privacy rights of users; 
online safety and other steps to protect the rights of 
vulnerable populations; and our commitments to 
accessible technologies. Other salient human rights 
issues are addressed in other relevant sections of 
the report, including our commitments to ethics 
and anti-corruption discussed in Chapter 2; how 
our human rights commitments apply to our 
workforce discussed in Chapter 3; our work 
empowering communities discussed in Chapter 4; 
and the work we do to apply our human rights 
commitments to our direct and indirect suppliers 
discussed in Chapter 6. We are among the first 
companies to apply the Guiding Principles  
Reporting Framework to our reporting and look 
forward to learning from other examples of how 
they are implemented to inform our approach in 
future reports.

5.1

Our Approach

Our human rights commitments are incorporated 
into our Standards of Business Conduct, which  
all employees receive and for which they must 
complete training (as described in depth in the 
Ethical Business Conduct and Governance 
chapter). Our human rights commitments are  
also highlighted in a range of role-specific train-
ings tailored to particular business functions.  
As our Global Human Rights Statement articulates, 
we regularly review and strengthen anonymous 
grievance reporting mechanisms that allow our 
employees and others affected by our operations 
to report suspected incidents of human rights 
abuse. We investigate and, where appropriate, 
take remedial action to address reported viola-
tions. The mechanisms take multiple channels, 
ranging from our Standards of Business Conduct 
hotline described in the Ethics and Business 
Compliance chapter to private communications 

we have with human rights defenders, such as 
Freedom House, that work with us to disable user 
accounts that have been compromised by political 
regimes conducting human rights abuses. 

Since 2013, the Microsoft Technology and  
Human Rights Center has worked to prioritize  
and coordinate human rights due diligence, identify 
emerging risks and opportunities related to human 
rights, and promote harmonized approaches to 
human rights across Microsoft. The Center also 
works to foster dialogue to advance understanding 
of the human rights impacts of information and 
communications technology (ICT). Through the 
Center, Microsoft engages with a broad range of 
human rights groups, academics, and industry 
groups globally to share Microsoft’s experiences 
and lessons learned. Among its activities in FY15, 
the Center has:

•  Collaborated with groups such as the Aspen 
Institute’s Business and Society Program, The 
Conference Board, International Corporate 
Governance Network, and World Economic 
Forum to share best practices for business to 
address human rights issues. 

•  Hosted a series of multi-stakeholder workshops 
on business and human rights in the United 
Kingdom, Brussels, and Central Europe. 

•  Sponsored and participated in RightsCon 
Southeast Asia, a summit on defending 
digital rights of Internet users which attracted 
participants from NGOs, business, and 
governments from 50 countries. 

•  Convened a range of events including 

roundtables at the World Economic Forum 
Annual Meeting in Davos on LGBT equality and 
on government surveillance and meetings with 
institutional investors and corporate lawyers to 
raise awareness and understanding of the UN 
Guiding Principles.

5.2 Privacy and Data Security

Microsoft has a longstanding commitment to ensuring the privacy and security of 
our customers’ data. We have a strong set of privacy principles and practices that 
apply company-wide. We incorporate privacy considerations into our design and 
development processes, offer our customers meaningful privacy choices, and 
responsibly manage and protect the customer data that we store. 

We’ve led our industry with privacy protections 
such as our commitment to not scan Microsoft 
Outlook or other email services for purposes of 
targeting online advertising. In October 2014, 
Microsoft became one of the first companies to 
sign the Student Privacy Pledge developed by 
the Future of Privacy Forum and the Software & 
Information Industry Association to establish a 
common set of principles to protect the privacy  
of student information.

In our ongoing effort to give customers meaning-
ful data about when and how we collect and use 
personal data, in June 2015 we updated the Micro-
soft Services Agreement to provide one place to 
understand the privacy protections in place for 
most of Microsoft’s consumer services, including 
Bing, Cortana, OneDrive, Outlook.com, Skype, 
and Xbox Live. At the same time, we updated 
the Microsoft Privacy Statement to provide a 
single, straightforward resource for understanding 
Microsoft’s commitments for protecting individual 
privacy with these services. 

Our privacy protections have gained external 
recognition. Microsoft is the first major cloud 
provider to adopt—and gain independent  
verification for meeting—the world’s first  
international standard for cloud privacy, the ISO/
IEC 27018 standard developed by the International 
Organization for Standardization to establish a 
uniform, international approach to protecting 
privacy for personal data stored in the cloud.  
This builds on past efforts: in April 2014 we 
received confirmation from European data  
protection authorities that Microsoft’s enterprise 
cloud contracts are in line with “model clauses” 
under EU privacy laws regarding the international 
transfer of data, becoming the first company to 
receive such recognition. 

With ongoing concerns about government  
surveillance practices over the past several years, 
Microsoft has categorically stated that we do not 
provide any government with direct and unfet-
tered access to our customers’ data, and we  
don’t provide any back doors. As we’ve publicly 
disclosed, if a government wants our customers’ 
data, it must serve us with the appropriate warrant, 
court order, or subpoena targeted at specific 
accounts and identifiers. We reject requests that 
don’t meet these requirements, and we only 
provide the data specified in the legal order. 
Measures we’ve taken over the past two years  
to ensure we continue to meet our commitments 
to data privacy and security and earn customers’ 
trust include expanding our use of encryption 
across our services, providing choice and transpar-
ency on data location, and strengthening legal 
protections for customers.

Privacy and Data Security

5.3 Global Network Initiative

Microsoft has also worked to champion our view 
that while technology has a critical role itself in 
protecting people’s rights and keeping people 
safe, technology and the Internet must be gov-
erned by law. To that end, both on our own and in 
collaboration with others in our industry, Microsoft 
is pushing for reform in government surveillance 
practices. We fought for and won the right to 
increase our disclosure on the volume of national 
security orders for customer data we receive 
from the US government. We’ve very publicly 
advocated that governments need to create a 
new international legal framework to ensure that 
governments seek information about the private 
citizens of other participating countries only 
pursuant to legal rules and due process. 

Throughout FY15, we engaged in an ongoing 
legal challenge to the US government’s attempt 
to mandate that we turn over a customer’s email 
content stored in our datacenter located in Ireland. 
We have gained support from more than two 
dozen leading technology and media companies 
to argue that digital information must be afforded 
the same legal protections as physical documents 
and correspondence. Beyond addressing this spe-
cific case, we have also advocated about the ways 

to best protect privacy, ensure that governments 
keep people safe, and respect national sovereignty 
while preserving the global nature of the Internet.

To help inform the public debate about the 
best ways to balance privacy and security and 
in keeping with our longstanding commitment 
to transparency, we publish a semi-annual Law 
Enforcement Requests Report and clearly outline 
our well-documented practices for responding 
to government demands for customer data. 
The report includes the number of demands we 
receive and the number of accounts or identifiers 
that may be affected by these demands. We also 
provide details on the number of demands we 
complied with and, if we complied, whether we 
provided content or non-content data. In addition, 
as a result of a concerted effort by Microsoft and 
our industry partners, we are now permitted to 
publish data about the number of legal demands 
we receive from the US government pursuant to 
national security laws. 

Microsoft is a founding member and sits on the board of the Global Network 
Initiative (GNI), a collaborative effort between ICT companies, civil society 
organizations, socially responsible investors, and academics. GNI provides a set of 
Principles and Implementation Guidelines regarding practical steps and policies ICT 
companies can adopt to respect and advance the freedom of expression and privacy 
rights of their users when faced with governmental demands. 

The GNI provides for a series of independent 
assessments conducted every other year by an 
independent assessor accredited by the GNI 
Board, on how its member companies are imple-
menting the GNI Principles. The independent 
assessor reviews the policies and procedures 
adopted by the company in accordance with the 
GNI guidelines and looks at how the policies and 
procedures were implemented in real-world cases. 
Based on the results of the most recent assess-
ment and engagement with Microsoft, the GNI 
Board determined that Microsoft is compliant with 
the GNI Principles. The assessment found that the 
systems, policies, and procedures that Microsoft 
relies upon to implement the GNI Principles 
are both mature and subject to ongoing review 

with an eye to continuous improvement. The 
GNI’s public report on the results of its Phase III 
company assessments is available online.

As part of our commitment to GNI and under 
our Global Human Rights Statement, Microsoft 
has independent experts in business and human 
rights conduct Human Rights Impact Assessments 
(HRIAs) of specific parts of our business. The HRIAs 
include independent research, internal interviews, 
and engagement with external stakeholders to 
identify relevant human rights risks and oppor-
tunities for specific Microsoft products, services, 
business relationships, and markets.

5.4 Working to Protect the Rights of Vulnerable Populations

Microsoft works to help protect people of all ages and abilities against a broad 
range of risks, including malware, online hoaxes, tech scams, and online bullying.
To promote the safer use of Microsoft devices and online services, we offer a range 
of safety features, including family safety settings. We also have strong prohibitions 
against abusive behavior on our online services in our Terms of Use, which are 
enforced by complaint response teams on services such as Xbox Live.

We promote online safety broadly across the 
Internet as well. Microsoft has a near 20-year 
history making online safety resources  
available to children and their parents. In FY15,  
we enhanced our existing materials with new 
interactive and engaging online safety resources 
on the Microsoft YouthSpark Hub to empower and 
involve youth in adopting safer online habits and 
practices. In FY15, Microsoft joined the UK Prime 
Minister’s WePROTECT Children Online initiative 
to combat child sexual exploitation and abuse 
and serves as the industry representative on the 
WePROTECT International Advisory Board, which 
is recommending a series of actions for the global 
child protection community.

These and other activities follow Microsoft’s work 
six years ago with Dartmouth College to develop 
PhotoDNA, a free technology that helps identify 
and remove child sexual abuse images from 
among the billions of photos on the Internet. 
PhotoDNA has now become an industry best 
practice for combating child sexual abuse images 
and is used by NGOs, law enforcement, and other 
leading Internet companies like Facebook. At 
Microsoft, we use PhotoDNA to help disrupt the 

spread of child sexual abuse images through our 
Bing, OneDrive, and Outlook.com services. This 
year Microsoft made PhotoDNA available as a  
free cloud service to make it even easier for 
companies to detect and report illegal images of 
child sexual abuse before they are seen by others.

A broad range of groups across Microsoft work 
to advance a safer Internet for all, including the 
Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit, an international 
legal and technical team of more than 100  
attorneys, investigators, big data scientists, and 
forensic analysts. DCU’s cybercrime experts focus 
on two areas: fighting malware and reducing risk; 
and protecting vulnerable populations, especially 
the very young and the elderly. The DCU’s work 
includes investigating fraud and tech scams  
targeting unsuspecting and non-tech savvy cus-
tomers, who are primarily the elderly. To combat 
this problem, DCU works with law enforcement, 
the Federal Trade Commission, and advocacy 
groups such as AARP to educate consumers on 
how to avoid being scammed and, when neces-
sary, take legal action against known scammers.

5.5 Accessible Technology

As a reflection of our commitment to human rights and to our billions of  
users around the world, Microsoft seeks to provide products and services  
that empower people across a broad range of abilities, cultures, languages,  
and levels of economic development. 

This commitment starts with offering people 
access to technology in a language familiar  
to them that respects linguistic and cultural 
distinctions and helps sustain diverse local  
languages and cultures. Through the Microsoft 
Local Language Program, Microsoft collaborates 
with local governments, language authorities, 
universities, and NGOs to provide individuals 
access to computing in their native language.  
The local language program supports more than 
108 languages, covering 4.5 billion speakers 
around the planet. Under the program, Microsoft 
provides a range of language and translation tools 
and resources, including free Language Interface 
Packs to make Windows and Office applications 
available in local languages ranging from Albanian 
to Yoruba. 

In addition, Microsoft seeks to ensure our technol-
ogy is accessible to the more than 1 billion people 
around the world with a disability. The Microsoft 
Accessibility Standard is a company-wide policy 
that drives consideration for accessibility into the 
design, development, evaluation, and release of  
all of our products and services. Windows, Office, 
Internet Explorer, Xbox, and our other products 
and services include accessibility features and 
controls such as the Ease of Access Center in 
Windows. Beyond its own accessibility features, 
Microsoft Office 2013 includes an Accessibility 
Checker that helps users enhance the accessibility 
of their documents and presentations. We’ve 
found that many of our accessibility innovations 
and features allow us to deliver more flexible user 
experiences that benefit a wide range of our 
customers, not just those with disabilities. 

Microsoft offers guidance on accessibility to our 
users, with accessibility information available in 
over 40 languages. Microsoft Customer Support 
provides a dedicated support desk for customers 
who have disabilities or who are looking for support 
when also using assistive technology, such as screen 
readers, screen magnifiers, and speech recognition 
commands. We provide guidance to help users 
address a broad range of disabilities, including: 

•  Vision impairments

•  Dexterity and mobility impairments

•  Hearing impairments

•  Learning impairments

•  Language and communication impairments

•  Age-related impairments 

We are continually working to raise the aware-
ness of accessibility issues in the technology 
industry. The Microsoft Accessibility Developer 
Center provides guidance, tools, and technologies 
for developing accessible applications and web 
content. Our tools and guides help governments, 
schools, businesses, and organizations integrate 
technology for individuals with disabilities. Micro-
soft Research and product teams also collaborate 
with disability experts to unlock new uses for 
technologies that can dramatically benefit people 
with disabilities, such as helping individuals with 
paralysis communicate with their families using 
eye gaze technology and speech synthesizers on 
the Microsoft Surface. For more information, see 
the Microsoft Accessibility website.

in their implementation.

Goal: Supporting and advancing the implementation 
of the UN Convention for the Rights of People 
with Disabilities. 

Microsoft collaborates with governments, consumers, and 
organizations to support and advance the implementation 
of the UN Convention for the Rights of People with Disabili-
ties and promote digital inclusion of persons with disabilities 
in all aspects of development. We regularly partner with 
organizations such as the Global Initiative for Inclusive Infor-
mation and Communication Technologies (G3ict), the United

(UNESCO) and the Organization of American States (OAS) 
to raise awareness of the accessible ICT in countries such as 
Mexico, India, and South Africa. 

•  Continuing ongoing review of our policies and practices 
to ensure we are meeting our commitments to human 
rights and to perform ongoing assessments of the human 
rights impacts of our operations.

6.1

Our Approach

All suppliers doing business with Microsoft must uphold the ethical business, 
employment, environmental, and worker safety practices prescribed in our Supplier 
Code of Conduct—which aligns with, and in certain cases exceeds, the Electronic 
Industry Citizenship Coalition’s (EICC’s) responsible supply chain standards. We are 
also committed to ensuring that suppliers of the raw materials incorporated into 
our products operate sustainably and ethically.

We apply risk-based approaches for the respon-
sible management of all of our suppliers, with 
a particular focus on suppliers of products and 
services that directly touch our customers, such 
as Microsoft-branded hardware devices and 
packaging and outsourced customer service and 
support. We also work collaboratively with our 
suppliers on proactive initiatives that create value 
for their employees, the communities in which 
they operate, and their own businesses.

Within Microsoft, two groups work to ensure 
that our social, ethical, environmental, health, 
and safety requirements for suppliers are met. 
Microsoft’s Device and Supply Chain Group 
(DSC) established its Social and Environmental 
Accountability (SEA) Program in 2005 to ensure 

that our hardware and packaging suppliers 
conform to our Supplier Code of Conduct and 
additional hardware-related requirements for 
living conditions, safe working practices, and 
environmental, health, and safety protection. 
Microsoft’s Global Procurement Group, which 
manages Microsoft’s spending with indirect 
(that is, non-hardware) suppliers, created a new 
management function in 2013 to consolidate and 
enhance responsible sourcing activities based 
on learnings and best practices from the SEA 
Program. Together, these two programs promote 
capacity-building and establish proactive partner-
ships with suppliers, and embed social and 
environmental criteria into Microsoft’s core 
purchasing and sourcing decisions.

6.2

Social and Environmental 
Accountability in Our Device 
and Supply Chain Group

Our hardware business has grown since its inception in 1982. Our Device and Supply 
Chain Group manages this supply chain, which spans 25 countries around the 
world. To provide greater transparency on our hardware supply chain, we publish 
an annual list of our top 100 production suppliers for our commercially available 
hardware products. During FY15, our supply chain integrated the Nokia Devices 
and Services business, which expanded our suppliers to include those engaged 
in mobile device production.8

6.2 Social and Environmental Accountability

in Our Device and Supply Chain Group

SEA Supplier  
Engagement Approach

Microsoft’s Supplier Code of Conduct and SEA 
requirements are incorporated into our contracts 
with Tier 1 suppliers that manufacture our hardware 
components and products, and strategic Tier 2 
suppliers and other suppliers contracted by  
Microsoft to provide components and/or materials 
to our Tier 1 suppliers. We also require these suppli-
ers to address the SEA requirements with their own 
upstream and downstream suppliers with which 
Microsoft does not contract directly. Microsoft’s 
factory and sourcing managers partner with our 
SEA team of experts to ensure that Microsoft’s labor 
rights, ethics, environment, occupational health, 
and safety requirements are met.

We raise the performance bar with our existing 
suppliers while onboarding new suppliers. All new 
and directly contracted hardware and packaging 
suppliers undergo initial risk assessments and initial 
capability assessments and audits. A combination of 
third-party auditors and/or members of Microsoft’s 
SEA team conduct these audits and assessments 
using a checklist composed of the Electronics 
Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) requirements 
and additional Microsoft requirements on labor, 
environmental protection, ethics, worker health and 
safety, and management systems. During the review 
process, auditors examine documentation; visit 
production lines, dorms, canteens, and waste 
storage facilities; and conduct face-to-face  
interviews of workers and factory management.  
To ensure consistency and quality of third-party 
audits, Microsoft pre-qualifies third-party auditors 
through shadow audits and assessments of their 
onsite audit performance and reports.

contracted suppliers. Third-party auditors audit 
SEA conformance with our Tier 1 suppliers annu-
ally and our Tier 2 suppliers based on their risk 
level. Microsoft’s SEA team supplements these 
third-party audits with regular onsite assessments 
of Tier 1 factories and high- and medium-risk  
Tier 2 component suppliers. 

In cases when nonconformances are detected, our 
SEA team works closely with suppliers to develop 
corrective action plans to resolve detected issues, 
including building needed capabilities through 
education and training. Suppliers are required  
to identify the root cause, establish a corrective 
course of action, and implement preventive 
actions for all issues found. Suppliers must  
correct issues within specific deadlines based  
on the severity of the nonconformance or risk 
termination of our business.

Beyond auditing, learning directly from workers is a 
key priority. In FY14, we launched an anonymous 
and factory-independent worker grievance hotline 
pilot project. This program continued to scale and 
increase in quality and efficiency in FY15, though  
a new partnership with China Labor Support 
Network. In its first year of operation, we rolled  
out the hotline in five Tier 1 factories and one  
Tier 2 factory. The hotline launch included worker 
orientations to encourage use of the hotline and  
to encourage factory management to consider  
the hotline as a resource for workplace labor and 
environment, health, and safety issues. In its first 
year of operation, the hotline received a total of  
232 inquiries. The three most frequent topics were 
related to wages and benefits, factory procedure 
and policy, and living conditions. Starting in FY16, 
we will make this hotline available to the rest of our 
Tier 1 suppliers in China and select Tier 2 suppliers.

SEA Audit and  
Assessment Findings

In FY15, we completed 314 third-party audits and 
Microsoft assessments of 138 suppliers. These 
audits and assessments continue to provide us 
with insight into the needs and challenges of our 
supply chain and guide our investments in supplier 
capability and future improvements.  

In this report, we disclose all findings of critical/
serious nonconformance with our SEA require-
ments. These critical/serious findings were 
escalated to Microsoft senior management, and 
the suppliers were placed on restricted status with 
no new Microsoft business awarded until the 
issues were resolved. In all instances, the suppliers 
instituted corrective action plans that were 
approved by Microsoft and follow-up audits 
confirmed that the suppliers were implementing 
the corrective action plans.

In the following SEA Audit and Assessment Results 
table, we provide year-over-year data on findings  
of critical/serious nonconformance with the require-
ments covered in these audits and assessments.

Changes in the number of audits and assessments 
conducted each year and the scope of those 
audits cause fluctuations in year-over-year  
comparisons. In addition, we are always learning 
during the course of our work, which results in 
improvements to our program and can increase 
findings. Nonetheless, to better facilitate compari-
sons going forward, this year we also report 
nonconformance percentages of suppliers audited 
in addition to reporting total findings. 

We typically see improvements in performance 
after working with suppliers on an ongoing basis 
on previously addressed issues. For the first time, 
this year we also broke out findings by new and 
existing suppliers. New suppliers are those new  
to the Microsoft Device Supply Chain and audited 
for the first time, while existing suppliers are those 
which received audits and assessments in the past. 
While informative, we emphasize that the percent-
ages are affected by our raising the bar on supplier 
performance year over year and enhancement of 
audit quality and auditor requirements.

11  The two cases are related to student workers, whose original ID cards were kept by their teacher.

12  Examples of these nine nonconformances include two child labor issues and seven issues of student 

workers working overtime. Neither child labor nonconformance found underage workers in the factory: 
one found evidence of past underage workers and one found insufficient documentation of legal proof of 
age. In both cases, the factories instituted new procedures for verifying and documenting proof of age to 
prevent hiring underage workers.

13  The case is related to incomplete and inaccurate attendance records of workers.

14  Examples of the cases involved factories not paying sufficient overtime compensation according to the 

local minimum wage.

15  This case is for requiring a pregnancy test for female workers during the onboarding health examination.

Enhancing Workplace  
Experiences

There is growing recognition among industry 
advocates that compliance audits and assessments 
are not a long-term solution to consistent perfor-
mance. We seek to establish best practices over 
time by building supplier capabilities through 
training and sharing experiences and best  
practices, including detailed guidelines on how  
to improve factory workers’ living environments 
and environmental health and safety systems. An 
example of this is the implementation of our Tier 1 
Model Factory Scorecard, created in FY13 with 
input from worker surveys and suppliers to identify 
best practices in living and working conditions. 
Through this collaborative effort and quarterly 
scorecard tracking progress, we are pleased to 
report that in FY15 all of our Tier 1 factories met our 
target performance goal of 95 percent or more on 
the Model Factory Scorecard, and we are now 
working with those factories to help them achieve 
100 percent compliance.

Over the past several years, we also significantly 
expanded job-related and life skills training 
opportunities in one or more of our Tier 1 supplier 
factories, including:

•  Creating a factory-specific curricula and 
delivery model for our China YouthSpark 
Information Technology (IT) skills training 
program. By the end of the pilot, December 
2013 to December 2014, a total of 6,731 workers 
(4,451 online and 2,280 classroom)  had taken 
the class.

•  Providing reproductive health education 

programs at all of our Tier 1 suppliers through 
the HERproject (Health Enables Returns) run by 
Business for Social Responsibility. In FY15, we 
trained a total of 7,685 workers, bringing the 
total number of workers trained since we 
launched in FY12 to 179,598 workers.

•  Piloting line leader capability training to 

improve front-line supervisors’ communication 
skills and management effectiveness. The pilot 
program trained 30 line leaders, each 
responsible for on average 30 workers (in total 
affecting 900 workers).

•  Rolling out training in parenting programs to 
support migrant parent workers who may be 
far away from their families. This program  
helps the migrant parents build and maintain 
meaningful relationships with their children to 
ensure that they are not only materially looked 
after, but emotionally as well. In FY15, the nine 
suppliers rolled out the training to all their 
workers, especially targeting their migrant 
workers. By the end of June 2015, a total of 
1,600 workers participated in this training.

6.2 Social and Environmental Accountability

in Our Device and Supply Chain Group

Environmental, Health, and 
Safety Capability Building

Factory worker health and safety is a top priority 
for Microsoft. Over the past four years, we have 
significantly expanded our engagements to help 
suppliers create and maintain safe working envi-
ronments. These programs included the following.

Training Resources
We created a training platform called SEA 
Academy that includes labor, ethics, environ-
mental, health, and safety (EH&S) training course 
modules for suppliers. In FY15, we also conducted 
trainings for 504 trainees from our high-risk sup-
pliers. The courses are also designed as a “train 
the trainer” with project management training to 
complement the expert content and provide tools 
on how to successfully improve their factories. 

Health and Safety Programs
We worked with factory management to emphasize 
the need to use competent and experienced EH&S 
professionals to define and implement the programs 
necessary to build a culture of health and safety. To 
address this, we piloted a number of training modules 
in our Tier 1 and high-risk Tier 2 suppliers, including: 

•  Safety Culture

•  EH&S Professionals and Senior Management 

Capability Improvement

•  EH&S Employee Participation

•  Risk Behavior Change

•  EH&S Standardization

•  Risk Assessment

•  Chemical Safety and Management

•  Line Manager EH&S Skills Improvement

•  Safety Officer Certification for EH&S Staff

•  Prevention of Occupational Disease

•  Effective Water Management

In FY15, 528 SEA professionals from the Microsoft 
Device Supply Chain attended our SEA in-house 
training, representing factories with more than 
32,000 workers.

Injury Data Tracking
We track key health and safety performance 
indicators for our Tier 1 factories using standard 
OSHA metrics. In FY15, our Tier 1 suppliers aver-
aged a work-related injuries and illness rate of 
0.045 versus an industry benchmark of 1.4, and a 
lost working-hour accident rate of 0.031 versus an 
industry benchmark of 0.7.

Key Tier 2 Supplier Improvement Program
In FY14, to address the growing need for additional 
capacity building among some Tier 2 suppliers, we 
launched a new program to provide targeted 
component suppliers with onsite consulting from 
the SEA program team. We also continued our 
program to target our lowest performing compo-
nent suppliers with special additional inspections 
that include Microsoft executives as well as SEA  
and Sourcing team members. This subset of  
suppliers face an additional compliance scorecard 
and must improve their performance within a 
quarter. Additional time may be given in certain 
occasions that are justified and approved by the 
SEA team. As a result of the close engagement and 
collaboration with suppliers to make improvements 
identified during these audits and assessments, 

factory and worker conditions have advanced at 
many of our suppliers. Suppliers who failed to meet 
the requirements are subject to phase-out and 
termination of business with Microsoft.

Sustainable Manufacturing

In addition to meeting legal requirements, we 
apply the same Social and Environmental 
Accountability standards and processes to the 
factories we own and directly operate. Within our 
Microsoft Devices Group (now called the Windows 
and Devices Group), we created a global manufac-
turing Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) team 
of experts in industrial safety, occupational health, 
and environmental sustainability to work across 
these factories to align programs and priorities, 
ensure excellence in EH&S, and drive continuous 
improvement. This new team works closely to align 
approaches with our existing Supplier Social and 
Environmental Accountability team that addresses 
labor rights, employee health and safety, and 
environmental standards in our hardware and 
packaging suppliers and with our corporate-wide 
Occupational Health & Safety & Well Being team 
in Human Resources.

6.3 Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials 

Microsoft’s commitment to the responsible production of our hardware and 
packaging extends to the raw materials that go into them. In 2014, we formalized 
our values and approach around upstream responsible sourcing through our 
Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials policy, which goes beyond conflict minerals 
to apply to all materials sourced around the world. This policy extends our Supplier 
Code of Conduct expectations in support of human rights, labor, health and safety, 
environmental protection, and business ethics to all harvested and extracted 
materials incorporated into our products. 

We exercise due diligence across our supply chain 
through a material tracing process that allows us 
to immediately identify the constituent substances 
used in our products and trace them back to their 
associated suppliers. Beyond our own supply  
chain due diligence, we have now moved our 
collaborative efforts to the upstream mining 
industry, through direct participation in and 
support of the Initiative for Responsible Mining 
Assurance, Pact, and the Alliance for Responsible 
Mining, to holistically cover end-to-end mining 
sustainability, from artisanal to larger mining 
enterprises. It is our intention that these initiatives 
eventually will enable our suppliers to purchase 
responsibly sourced materials for use in our 
products and address important challenges for  

the supply chains dependent upon the use of 
metals, ranging from underage labor to environ-
mental degradation. On the specific issue of tin 
originating from Indonesia, Microsoft is also a 
member of the IDH Tin Working Group, which 
brings together a range of stakeholders seeking  
to address the social and environmental issues 
related to tin mining.

In another example, we have collaborated with  
our suppliers and other hardware companies since 
2007 to address conflict minerals from the eastern 
DRC. Our suppliers must not knowingly use 
minerals that are not DRC conflict-free and we 
expect our suppliers to engage in similarly robust 
due diligence activities. We provide a detailed 

discussion of our conflict minerals due diligence 
process and findings in our June 2015 Conflict 
Minerals Report filed with the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission under requirements of  
the Dodd-Frank Act. Microsoft’s report has been 
cited for its leadership in transparency with the 
disclosure of as much smelter-level and country-
of-origin data as we have available. As with our 
broader efforts on mining sustainability, we 
believe that collaborative partnerships are most 
effective in addressing conflict minerals. 

Meaningful progress related to conflict minerals is 
reflected in our Conflict Minerals Report filed with 
the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 
June 2015. The number of conflict-free smelters in 
our supply chain increased from 80 to 148, due to 
the integration of Nokia’s Devices and Services 
Group, supplier outreach, and the maturation of 
the Conflict Free Smelter Program (CFSP), of which 
we were an original participant and remain a 
strong supporter. In addition, in spring 2015 we 
passed a significant milestone with all tantalum 
smelters identified in the Microsoft supply chain 
validated as conflict-free. We strengthened our 
supplier audit process to improve due diligence, 
developed new controls to standardize supplier 
reports, and initiated third-party assistance to help 
smelters prepare for CFSP validation. 

More detailed results of our conflict minerals due 
diligence process and findings are available in our 
latest Conflict Minerals Report, available on our 
Responsible Sourcing webpage for download. 

We also have supported the Conflict Free Smelter 
Initiative (CFSI) since its inception in 2010 and 
donated to the initial audit fund to make it easier 
for smelters to become certified through CFSI’s 
Conflict Free Smelter Program.

We support several other organizations  
promoting responsible mining and an end  
to conflict in and around the DRC, including the 
Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals 
Trade and the Responsible Sourcing Network’s 
Multi-Stakeholder Group.

6.4 Responsible Sourcing with Indirect Suppliers

As with our SEA Program for hardware suppliers, Microsoft’s Global Procurement 
Group’s responsible sourcing initiatives span a broad range of work to ensure 
compliance, advance sustainability in procurement processes, and pursue 
partnerships with suppliers. 

Microsoft screens our indirect (that is, non-
hardware) suppliers on an ongoing basis against 
23 different ethical, social, and environmental 
risks by country and by commodity category, 
and applies assurance requirements for suppliers 
found to pose the highest risks. Among these, we 
have dedicated supplier training and assurance 
programs related to anti-corruption and privacy 
and security.

For our top strategic suppliers, our Responsible 
Sourcing program monitors compliance with 
our Supplier Code of Conduct through quarterly 
scorecards that are integrated into their business 
dashboards and review. For our suppliers of prod-
ucts and services that directly touch our customers 
(for example, our outsourced customer service 
and support) the program ensures compliance 
through onsite assessments. These suppliers 
also face additional Responsible Sourcing 
Requirements to issue annual Corporate Social 

Responsibility reports that include metrics drawn 
from the Global Reporting Initiative. 

Finally, another significant requirement launched 
in FY15 and being rolled out into FY16 involves 
new procurement standards to ensure that a wide 
variety of suppliers that do business with Microsoft 
in the US provide their employees who handle 
our work with at least 15 days of paid leave each 
year. We believe we were the first large company 
to take this approach, and we gained significant 
attention for the move from the media, policymak-
ers, and other companies. We are working to be 
thoughtful to ensure the changes don’t undermine 
the breadth and diversity of our suppliers as we 
implement the new requirement.

Microsoft has a long-standing and strong 
commitment to source from historically dis-
advantaged groups. Our Procurement team 
is committed to increasing our spending with 
diverse suppliers as part of our Supplier Diver-
sity Program. In FY15, Microsoft spent $2.3 
billion with minority-, disabled-, veteran-, and 
woman-owned businesses, placing Microsoft 
in the top 20 companies globally for spending 
with diverse suppliers. We also have focused 
programs in place to encourage diversity 
among the law firms we do business with and 
to increase the diversity of banks and financial 
institutions we use.

Responsible Sourcing with Indirect Suppliers

Supplier Capacity Building and 
Partnerships

Beyond risk mitigation, we also work to  
advance citizenship projects with our suppliers 
that create shared value. We encourage and 
recognize suppliers who made exceptional  
impact in social and environmental areas through 
our supplier awards program, which highlights 
those awarded as examples to attendees of our 
annual supplier summit. In 2015 these awards 
included a Supplier Diversity Award, Bring the 
Opportunity Divide Leadership Award, Impact 
Sourcing Leadership Award, and Climate Perfor-
mance Leadership Award. 

We provide supplier development and training 
resources, including our Supplier Code of Conduct 
Training Program. This online training is manda-
tory for a segment of our suppliers based on risk 
to ensure they understand and follow ethical 
business practices in accordance with our Supplier 
Code of Conduct. In FY15, 55,063 employees at 
6,413 suppliers completed this training. Beyond 
this mandatory training, we invite key suppliers  
to participate in webinars and workshops on 
topics ranging from Microsoft’s carbon neutrality 
program to the latest Global Reporting Initiatives 
guidelines. We participate in the CDP Supply Chain 
Program to provide our suppliers a standardized 
platform to understand the risks and opportunities 
that climate change presents to them.

Through the Microsoft YouthSpark Supplier 
Community Technology Center (CTC) program,  
we collaborate with suppliers to further extend  
the reach of Microsoft’s YouthSpark initiative.  
We provide curriculum and support to help our 
suppliers use their facilities to host technology 
skills trainings for their employees and local 
community members. These trainings provide 
participants with an opportunity to receive a 
no-cost Microsoft Digital Literacy certificate, a key 
qualification for many technology jobs. To date,  
16 suppliers have launched centers at 26 locations 
in 13 countries and 45,000 participants have 
achieved a Microsoft Digital Literacy Certificate.  

In a separate initiative, in FY15 we continued our 
collaboration with the Rockefeller Foundation to 
research and promote best practices in “Impact 
Sourcing” with suppliers that proactively seek to 
provide work and training opportunities to high 
potential but disadvantaged individuals. Several  
of our suppliers have embraced this concept and 
partnered with us in a multi-stakeholder group  
to develop Impact Sourcing success metrics, and  
also helped developed business cases on Impact 
Sourcing. In addition, our suppliers have commit-
ted to create over 5,000 Impact Employment jobs. 
In FY15, Microsoft supported Impact Sourcing 
projects in the United States, Kenya, Uganda, and 
India for services such as facilities management, 
and we are working to extend this approach with 
more suppliers.

6.5 FY15 Progress and FY16 Goals

Progress Against FY15 Goals

Goal: Evaluating and aligning our principles, policies, and 
activities across the Microsoft Devices Group to include the 
factories and suppliers related to the Nokia Devices and 
Services business we acquired near the end of FY14.

As reported in this chapter, we are applying the same SEA 
requirements that we apply to our suppliers’ factories to the 
factories we own. In FY15, we worked to align factory policies 
and practices with our labor, health and safety, environment, 
and ethics systems that we apply to our contracted suppliers 
and to our existing factory in Wilsonville, Oregon.

Goal: Continuing to scale our SEA supply chain programs 
such as the Model Factory Program, Worker Grievance 
reporting, and EH&S capability building to continue to 
enhance worker living and working conditions.

As detailed in this chapter, we continued or expanded all 
of these efforts and continue to see significant progress by 
participating suppliers.

Goal: Continuing to invest in improving the management 
system capabilities of low-performing, high-risk Tier 2 fac-
tories by providing targeted SEA consulting and training.

As detailed in this chapter, we continued these efforts 
and continue to see significant progress by participating 
suppliers.

Goal: Working collaboratively with NGOs and others in our 
industry to advance the goals of the Microsoft Policy on 
Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials, including further 
progress addressing conflict minerals.

As reported in this chapter and our Conflict Minerals Report, 
we expanded our NGO partnerships and made significant 
progress tracking minerals in our supply chain and expand-
ing coverage of certified conflict-free smelters.

Goal: Enhancing the screening of our non-hardware supply 
chain annually for ethical, social, and environmental risks 
and deepening assurance requirements for suppliers found 
to pose the highest risks. These will include EICC-based 
supplier self-assessment questionnaires, contractually 
binding Responsible Sourcing Requirements, quarterly 
scorecards, onsite assessments, and third-party audits.

In FY15 we continued to refine and enhance our approaches 
to screening our indirect suppliers and applying a range of 
assurance mechanisms, including onsite assessments based 
on suppliers’ risks. As described in this chapter, Microsoft 
screens our non-hardware suppliers on an ongoing basis 
against 23 different ethical, social, and environmental risks 
by country and by commodity.

FY16 Strategic Goals

•  Broadening the scale of our SEA supply chain programs, 
such as the SEA Academy, Model Factory Program, 
Worker Grievance reporting, Labor and EH&S capability 
building, to continue to enhance worker living and 
working conditions. 

• 

Increasing our ongoing investment in improving the 
management system capabilities of low-performing, 
high-risk Tier 2 factories by providing targeted SEA 
consulting and training.

•  Continuing to strengthen engagements and work 

collaboratively with NGOs and the electronics and other 
industry sectors to advance the goals of the Microsoft 
Policy on Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials, 
including further progress addressing conflict minerals.

•  Expanding consideration of the sustainability 

performance of our indirect suppliers in our procurement 
decisions and supplier awards.

7.1 Our Approach

Microsoft believes that information technology has tremendous potential to help 
solve pressing environmental and energy challenges. We understand and embrace 
the opportunity to help people and organizations around the world improve the 
environment. We seek to advance sustainability through the products and cloud 
capabilities we offer to our customers and partners, and the use of big data to 
discover the next generation of innovations and insights.

At the same time, we recognize the need to 
address our own environmental footprint as  
both our datacenter operations and hardware 
offerings grow. Microsoft is pioneering new  
ways technology can make our own operations 
more sustainable. Since 2013, we’ve achieved 100 
percent carbon neutrality for our global operations, 
which includes our datacenters, labs, offices,  
manufacturing facilities, and business air travel. 

This commitment was achieved by boosting 
efficiency, purchasing renewable energy in the 
markets of our operations equal to 100 percent  
of our energy consumption where available, and 
conducting a voluntary carbon offset program.  
We also work hard to ensure sustainability is 
considered at each state of the lifecycle of our 
devices, from their design through end of life.

Environmental Principles, 
Policies, and Management

Our commitment to environmental sustainability 
spans our company. We seek to advance 
sustainability through the products and platform 
capabilities we offer our customers and partners, 
our own business practices, and our global 
partnerships with governments, academics, 
nonprofits, and others. 

Microsoft’s commitments to environmental sus-
tainability are articulated in our Environmental 
Principles and Climate Change Policy Statement 
and embedded in other corporate policies for how 
we run our business, such as our Environmental 
Compliance Specifications for hardware and our 
policy on Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials.

Microsoft has a global corporate environmen-
tal strategy team and environmental experts 
embedded within engineering, supply chain, 
procurement, research, real estate and facilities, 
datacenters, and legal and corporate affairs. Their 
work is governed through executive oversight and 
is reviewed semi-annually by the Regulatory and 
Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors.

Our environmental strategy includes a corporate 
carbon neutrality goal as well as goals for specific 
areas of our business, ranging from datacenter 
efficiency to energy and waste reduction at  
Microsoft campuses to the use of recycled content 
in packaging. Microsoft employees receive the 
appropriate role-based environmental training 
and certifications as needed for their jobs, such as 
training in chemical management for hardware lab 
employees and design for environment training 
for packaging engineers. We also promote broad 
environmental awareness by emailing an annual 
update on our environmental goals and progress 
to all Microsoft employees globally. 

Core parts of Microsoft’s operations are  
certified to the International Organization  
for Standardization (ISO) 14001 Environmental  
Management System. This includes our European 
Operations Center, all Microsoft-owned manufac-
turing sites and all the contract manufacturing 
facilities of our Tier 1 hardware suppliers. Microsoft 
also earned a cross-company, corporate-level  
ISO 14001 certification for Microsoft’s hardware 
and packaging manufacturing supply chain 
management and operations.

7.2 Products

We are committed to delivering products, solutions, and services that help 
organizations boost efficiency and minimize environmental impact.

Cloud and Azure

As a carbon neutral cloud services provider, 
Microsoft offers organizations a carbon-efficient 
and carbon neutral alternative to running their 
own private datacenters. Moving to Microsoft 
cloud services for Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft 
SharePoint, and Microsoft Dynamics CRM capabili-
ties can help businesses reduce energy use and 
carbon emissions by 30 to 90 percent per user 
versus running on-premises. 

Driving Energy Efficiency  
in and with Our Services  
and Devices

We are focused on and committed to increasing 
computing power per unit of energy consumed 
across the services and devices that we offer in  
the marketplace. Each new version of Windows 
offers enhancements to energy efficiency and 
power management tools, including a new Energy 
Saver Mode added to Windows 10. Third-party 
applications also have an important role to play, 
and we provide energy-smart development 
guidance and tools for developers and IT profes-
sionals developing for the Windows platform.

In FY15, Microsoft certified its first ENERGY STAR 
and EPEAT registered product, Surface Pro 3, when  
the standards were revised to bring tablets into 

scope. FY15 was also the first year for ULE 110 
certifications of mobile phones. This certification 
establishes multiple sustainability criteria for 
mobile phones, including packaging, materials, 
manufacturing and operations, energy efficiency 
of the power supply, health and environment, and 
end of life management. All Xbox consoles are 
configured to automatically reduce energy use 
while inactive. We also have committed to limit 
Xbox energy consumption in dashboard and 
media play.

We work to reduce the environmental impacts of 
our products and services but see even greater 
opportunity to benefit the environment at scale by 
delivering products, solutions, and services that 
help our customers’ organizations boost efficiency 
and minimize their environmental impact. 

With Microsoft Azure, businesses can use  
Microsoft carbon neutral datacenters for  
on-demand compute and storage, helping save 
energy costs and reduce their company’s carbon 
footprint while also reducing the capital costs 
associated with purchasing hardware and infra-
structure. The Microsoft cloud is also connecting 
public and private data sources with the privacy, 
security, and control needed for cities to have 
effective cross-departmental collaboration  
and resource sharing for greater efficiency; the 
scalability and cost-effectiveness of cloud services 
help reduce costs without cutting essential  
services. Organizations that invest in Microsoft 
Azure will be able to harvest information and data 
as resources to help service increasing populations 
more efficiently and with less waste.

CityNext

For cities, Microsoft CityNext partners provide 
solutions spanning energy, water, buildings, 
infrastructure, and transportation to help modern-
ize cities in sustainable ways that will minimize 
their resource use and environmental impact. Our 
broad portfolio of familiar consumer and business 
platforms and partner solutions—which many 
cities already use—are meeting customers wher-
ever they are on the technology innovation curve 
and helping them to build a bridge to the future. 
Within our Sustainable Cities focus, we deliver 
solutions for:

•  Buildings, infrastructure, and planning. 

Microsoft partners are using both design and 
embedded technology to lower the energy 
consumption and improve the performance of 
buildings. By combining existing systems with 
cloud-based analytics and business intelligence 
capabilities, buildings can be smarter and more 
efficient, and save about 10 percent of energy 
costs per year.

•  Energy and water. By using digital technology 
to integrate and manage distributed energy 
supply and demand data, Microsoft partners 
are working to improve the reliability, security, 
and efficiency of the electric system, as well as 
using technology to measure, manage, and 
report on carbon and other environmental 
impacts.

•  Transportation. Through software, Microsoft 

partners are helping to improve the design and 
operation of transport networks and run real-
time data systems that can facilitate cleaner and 
more efficient transport choices.

To date, we have recruited more than 1,000 part-
ners that are delivering more than 870 solutions 
in countries all around the world from Ankara, 
Turkey, to Auckland, New Zealand.

Productivity

With the increasing number of interconnected 
devices—from thermostats, appliances, and 
fixtures, to equipment, vehicles, and charging sta-
tions—all generating massive sets of data, big data 
is changing what is possible with sustainability. 
Microsoft is investing to help customers manage 
smart resources using big data through tools for 
Windows Server and Windows Azure.

Through data and analytics, customers are gaining 
vital insights from millions of devices, social 
media channels, and business systems. This data 
represents a significant opportunity to make more 
accurate decisions, achieve greater efficiencies, 
and become more sustainable in areas like energy, 
water, buildings, transportation, and countless 
other scenarios. For example, to increase the use 
of renewable energy, big data can be used to 
more effectively understand and anticipate energy 
demand and consumption in near real time, which 
can enable more responsive generation. Distribu-
tion needs to become more flexible to manage 
renewable sources, and end use is critical to the 
equation in taking advantage of technology, 
eliminating waste, and optimizing consumption. 

Microsoft Office 365 solutions support the new 
world of work by streamlining communications 
and collaboration and thereby reducing the 
need for business travel and commuting—while 
delivering all the environmental benefits of cloud 
computing. Skype adds to these enterprise-grade 
collaboration, online conferencing, and desktop-
sharing capabilities with its global customer base, 
making it even easier for businesses to use online 
meetings in place of travel to connect with trading 
partners and customers.

7.2 Products

Design for Green Devices

The Safety, Compliance, and Sustainability team 
within the Microsoft Devices Group incorporates 
environmental and safety principles and processes 
in the design and production of our devices and 
product packaging. The team works with design 
groups through a Design for Green initiative  
to evaluate and encourage the use of more 
environmentally benign materials, increase  
the recyclability of our devices and packaging,  
and minimize material use. The team provides 
guidance on alternative materials and other ways 
to address environmental impacts. We also require 
our suppliers to identify every material that’s in our 
products and to follow a comprehensive list of 
restricted substances specifications to avoid 
hazardous materials. 

To address sustainability in packaging, we’ve 
designed packaging for Xbox One, Surface, and 
our hardware peripherals to reduce the use of 
materials and replace plastics with paperboard 
packaging and materials from sugarcane waste. 
We also set standards of a minimum of 50 percent 
recycled content (25 percent of which must be 
post-consumer) for paperboard packaging and a 
minimum of 25 percent post-consumer content 
for rigid plastic packaging. 

Device Take-Back  
and Recycling

Microsoft is committed to meeting and going 
beyond government standards on take-back and 
responsible recycling or disposal of electronics, 
batteries, and packaging. We are a member of 
more than 145 government-mandated recycling 
schemes and producer responsibility organizations 
worldwide. In addition, we also offer several volun-
tary take-back and recycling programs, including 
incentives to bring used electronics to Microsoft 
Stores for recycling. We offer a comprehensive 
online tool to help consumers understand the 
recycling options available to them in their specific 
location. Where no local options exist, consumers 
can use the tool to contact Microsoft and we will 
generate a postage-paid e-label for them to use  
to send their equipment to a contracted recycler  
for free.

Microsoft also offers two programs, Microsoft 
Authorized Refurbisher (MAR) and Microsoft 
Registered Refurbisher Program (RRP), that help 
refurbishers extend the life of used PCs by provid-
ing them with commercial licenses for Microsoft 

software and non-profit organization licenses for 
those serving non-profits and schools. Through 
these programs, Microsoft and our refurbisher 
partners provided nonprofits and schools access 
to 746,140 refurbished computers in FY15.

Microsoft works to responsibly reuse, refurbish, or 
recycle used computers and electronics from our 
own operations and used personal and electronic 
items from our employees. For our own e-waste 
and the e-waste we collect from employees and 
customers, Microsoft requires external certification 
of the recycling partners that we contract with  
and bans any landfilling or exportation of used 
electronics that they collect. The recycling partners 
directly contracted by Microsoft to manage our 
e-waste and the e-waste we collect from employees 
and customers must meet stringent specifications. 
These include a product landfill and export ban. 
Microsoft also requires the recyclers to be certified 
by a recognized scheme such as ISO 14001, R2, or 
E-Steward; conduct assessments of their down-
stream partners; track the material types and 
quantities that they process to final disposition;  
and provide a certificate of destruction. Finally, 
Microsoft forbids the use of prison or other  
involuntary labor to staff recycling operations.

7.3 Our Business Practices

We are mindful that environmental stewardship needs to begin with our own 
operational practices, which includes delivering on our commitment to be 
carbon neutral and to procure 100 percent renewable energy.

Carbon Neutrality  
Commitment and Carbon Fee

in the same markets as our operations wherever 
possible) and externally certified carbon 
offset projects. 

Since July 1, 2012, Microsoft has achieved carbon 
neutrality across our global operations, spanning 
more than 100 countries, for our datacenters, 
software development labs, offices, business air 
travel, and (as of July 1, 2015) Microsoft-owned 
manufacturing operations. Our carbon neutral 
strategy hinges on company-wide accountability, 
achieved through an internal carbon fee 
cascaded globally to our business groups. 
This chargeback model puts a price on carbon 
and makes the company’s business divisions 
responsible for the cost of reducing and compen-
sating for the carbon emissions associated with 
their electricity use and air travel. The carbon 
fee funds energy efficiency investments, purchas-
ing renewable energy equal to 100 percent of our 
consumption (with the green power purchases 

In April 2015 Microsoft released a whitepaper 
describing the progress made with our carbon 
fee since its inception, in the hope to inspire other 
organizations to take similar action. Among the 
results it details: since the inception of the carbon 
fee, we have purchased more than 10 million 
megawatt-hours (MWh) of green power, reduced 
our emissions by 7.5 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e), saved more than 
$10 million a year, and had an impact on more 
than 3.2 million people in emerging nations 
through carbon offset community projects. 

Besides our carbon neutrality commitment, we 
have a 100 percent renewable energy commit-
ment, which we meet through direct purchases of 
renewable energy and the purchase of renewable 
energy credits. We currently use directly purchased 

renewable electricity to power 23 percent of our 
operations, and are exploring opportunities to 
expand our direct purchase of renewable energy 
and support the construction of new renewable 
energy projects. In FY15 we purchased more than 
3.2 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of renewable 
energy, and in January 2015 the US Environmental 
Protection Agency ranked us as the second-
largest user of green power in the US. The new 
110-megawatt (MW) Keechi Wind project that we 
funded through a 20-year agreement to purchase 
100 percent of its output came online in FY15, and 

we also announced an even larger power pur-
chase agreement for all of the output of the new 
175-MW Pilot Hill Wind Project. We also generate 
a small amount of onsite renewable energy, such 
as from solar panels covering the rooftops on our 
Silicon Valley campus. Finally, access to renewable 
energy is among the criteria that we consider in 
siting datacenters, and a number of our datacen-
ters, like our complex in Quincy, Washington, are 
powered by hydroelectricity.

In order of preference, we seek to use renewable energy by:

1

2

3

Connecting facilities directly 
to renewable energy sources 
where feasible.

Signing long-term renewable 
power purchase agreements 
in regions where we  
have operations and those 
projects are viable.

Investing in green power 
(RECs) to match our total 
electricity usage with the 
equivalent number of 
RECs that are credible, are 
verifiable, and add additional 
renewable energy to the grid.

7.3 Our Business Practices

Driving Energy Efficiency 
Across Our Operations

Building Efficiency Investments
Our last round of carbon-fee funded efficiency 
projects and other energy-efficiency investments 
by our Real Estate and Facilities group totaled  
over $3.1 million in investments that reduced our 
associated carbon emissions by 18,179 metric tons 
and also paid for themselves in less than a year 
with $3.6 million in energy savings. Beyond cost 
savings, we’ve also found opportunities to create 
new areas of revenue. Microsoft created an  
analytical software solution that joined together 
38,000 assets of disparate, sensor-enabled  
equipment across the 125 buildings in our Puget 
Sound headquarters. The system processes 500 
million data transactions every day to prioritize 
maintenance and repairs with the greatest  
energy and cost saving potential. The solution is 
generating energy savings of 10–11 percent and an 
implementation payback of less than 24 months. 
We are now expanding the solution to our other 
campuses with equally good results: the software 
identified $240,000 of energy savings at our 
Mountain View, CA campus within the first 30 days 

of deployment. We are sharing our results with 
government and industry leaders from around  
the globe and making similar solutions available 
through partners to our customers (such as 
through Microsoft CityNext offerings). With 
inefficient commercial buildings responsible f 
or upwards of 40 percent of the world’s energy 
consumption, we see the huge potential environ-
mental and business impacts from this approach.

Datacenters 
We’re designing energy-saving approaches into 
our new datacenters, such as using outside air 
cooling and airside economizers that dramatically 
cut the energy and water used for cooling. This 
approach to cooling reduces energy consumption 
by 15-20 percent and water consumption by 90 
percent. Overall, our datacenters average 1.4 PUE 
(Power Usage Effectiveness, one measure of data 
center efficiency), more efficient than the industry 
average of 1.7 PUE.

We are concerned about not just efficiency inside 
the datacenter, but also how to create dramatically 
more efficient systems, from the power plant to 
the chip. Examples of this approach include the 
pilot project datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming, 

which ran completely independently of the grid 
from 2014 to 2015 by using energy generated from 
biogas, a byproduct of a nearby water treatment 
plant. We’ve also pioneered a new concept to 
integrate fuel cells directly into server racks, which 
we expect to effectively cut datacenter energy 
intensity in half by eliminating transmission losses 
and other inefficiencies. We are working with 
industry partners and the DOE to pilot and com-
mercialize new energy technologies that will be 
foundational to the next generation of efficient 
datacenter designs. In another step forward in this 
approach, in FY15 we established a partnership 
with the University of Texas at San Antonio and the 
school’s Texas Sustainable Energy Research Insti-
tute to identify economically viable technologies 
that further reduce the environmental footprint of 
datacenters. Beyond the datacenters themselves, 
we’re building energy-saving features into our 
cloud services, such as the ability for developers to 
automatically scale their resource use to demand. 

Carbon Footprint  
and Energy Use

We have a longstanding commitment to  
transparently disclosing our carbon footprint  
and have voluntarily reported our carbon footprint 
through CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure 
Project) since 2004. Data on our carbon emissions 
are available on the CDP website. We also have 
pilot projects to encourage portions of our supply 
base to report their emissions to CDP. In recogni-
tion of our climate efforts, CDP included Microsoft 
on its Global 500 Climate Performance Leadership 
Index in the past two years. In September 2014, 
we earned the top grade “A” in CDP’s assessment 
of our performance to promote climate change 
mitigation, adaptation, and transparency, and CDP 
rated our disclosure and transparency on climate 
issues at 99 out of 100.

7.4 Water and Waste

Water 

Microsoft’s operations are generally not water 
intensive, with the exception of some of our data-
centers that rely on water for cooling. We’ve worked 
to mitigate the impacts of datacenter water use 
by using recycled municipal waste water in some 
water-scarce locations such as San Antonio, Texas.

Beyond datacenters, Microsoft continues to 
invest in water-saving fixtures in our office  
buildings and smart landscape irrigation  
practices to conserve water. 

20 This data covers 65 percent of Microsoft facilities by square foot-

age, including key water using data center operations. Additional 
details of our water use and previous years’ reports are publicly 
available in our CDP Water Project filing. As with emissions and 
energy data, we will disclose updated FY15 water data before the 
end of the calendar year at www.microsoft.com/transparencyhub.

Waste

Microsoft’s Real Estate and Facilities teams around 
the world implement waste minimization programs, 
including office supply reuse, recycling, and in many 
cases, composting programs. Among our accom-
plishments, we reduced, reused, or recycled 99 
percent of the waste from our Redmond, Washing-
ton dining facilities by switching to compostable 

tableware, administering aggressive recycling 
programs, and adapting our menu to get the  
most from each item of food served.

We’ve also set a long-term goal of 90 percent 
waste diversion from landfills across our global 
headquarters facilities in the Puget Sound region 
of Washington, which represent approximately 
36 percent of our total real estate portfolio. We’re 
rapidly approaching that goal and are working 
to extend that goal to additional campuses in the 
United States and around the globe.

Our increased use of recycling and composting 
and lower waste to landfill is evident in the fol-
lowing chart, covering data from our facilities 
across the Puget Sound region. We are working 
to increase the amount of waste data we collect 
across other Microsoft locations to improve our 
waste reporting in the future.

As we expand our on-campus hardware device 
labs, we have begun to generate hazardous waste 
and e-waste from developing and testing proto-
type devices. We have implemented a chemical 
management program that helps employees 
prevent waste generation by using less-polluting

products and reducing or eliminating unused 
materials. When we do generate waste, we recycle 
whenever possible and dispose of any remainder 
as required by local regulations. We have also 
developed an auditing program to verify that any 
facility that handles our waste for recycling or 
disposal can do so responsibly and while comply-
ing with environmental regulations. In FY14 we 
generated 1.68 metric tons of hazardous waste 
across our Puget Sound facilities, which was 
disposed of at properly permitted US hazardous 
waste facilities.

7.5 Partnerships

Microsoft works with governments, policymakers, and NGOs around the world 
to address key environmental issues that affect our business, employees, and 
the communities we serve. We are driving policy development and research with 
a broad range of diverse groups to achieve a more sustainable future. Through 
Microsoft Research and groups we sponsor, we are working to apply information 
technology to address large-scale environmental challenges.

Public Policy Engagement on 
Climate and Energy

Recognizing the need to work to address global 
environmental challenges in broad partnerships, 
Microsoft’s Climate Change Policy Statement 
recognizes that climate change is “a serious 
challenge that requires a comprehensive and 
global response from all sectors of society.”  
Microsoft is working to advance public policies 
that promote the use of information and commu-

nication technology (ICT) to advance energy 
efficiency, spur innovation and economic  
opportunity, and contribute to practical strategies 
for mitigating climate change. For the past six 
years, our annual Global Public Policy Agenda  
has included a section supporting government  
policies that support technological advances  
and innovation to reduce energy use and limit  
the effects of climate change. This section also 
includes support for cost-effective policies that 
increase the availability of low carbon and renew-
able energy for us to use in our operations. 

We have also supported industry and multi-
stakeholder initiatives to address climate policy. 
Among these:

•  We are a signatory to the Climate Declaration, a 

nonpartisan statement from the business 
community developed by Ceres and its 
Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy 
(BICEP) coalition, which notes that “tackling 
climate change is one of America’s greatest 
economic opportunities of the 21st century.” 

•  We are a founding member of the Digital 

Energy & Sustainability Solutions Campaign 
(DESSC), a coalition of leading ICT companies 
and environmental NGOs. DESSC is committed 
to advancing public policies that help drive 
sustainable economic growth through ICT-
enabled energy efficiency and clean energy 
innovation.

•  We serve on the board of the Global 

e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), a collaborative 
effort between leading IT companies and the 
United Nations Environment Programme and 
International Telecommunication Union. 
Microsoft has played a leadership role in the 
development of GeSI series of reports on how 
the ICT can address climate change (Smart 
2020, Smarter 2020, and Smarter 2030). The 
latest Smarter 2030 GeSI report identifies ways 
that ICT can enable a 20 percent reduction of 
global CO2 emissions by 2030. The report also 
identifies how ICT can integrate renewables into 
the grid, boost agricultural crop yields by 30 
percent, save over 300 trillion liters of water, 
and conserve 25 billion barrels of oil a year.

Microsoft Research

Microsoft supports environmental research that 
isn’t tied to developing a specific product or 
service, but rather advances the field of comput-
ing and demonstrates how cloud services and 
mobile devices can combine to help solve some 
of society’s biggest environmental challenges. Our 
own Microsoft Research (MSR) team is working 
on identifying and creating the next generation of 
climate change models, tools, and technologies 
that will continue to drive our company and the 
world forward, including the following:

•  Scientists at Microsoft Research Cambridge are 
working with the United Nations Environment 
Programme World Conservation Monitoring 
Centre to develop a model and tools that will 
help scientists and policy makers assess how—
in the face of an expanding population and 
expanding resource use per capita—to balance 
the need for increased food, timber, and textiles 
production, with industrial use of natural 
resources, with the healthy functioning of 
natural, semi-natural, and artificial ecosystems.

•  Microsoft Research’s Earth, Energy, and 

Environment collaboration projects focus on the 
development and adoption of technologies for 
scientific visualization and data management—
especially technologies that accelerate insight 
into the environmental and earth sciences.

FY16 Goals

Goal: Meeting our 100 percent renewable energy commit-
ment by matching the total amount of kWh consumed 
with the equivalent volume of renewable energy pur-
chased.

•  Continuing to achieve carbon neutrality and net-zero 
emissions for our datacenters, software development 
labs, offices, manufacturing facilities, and employee air 
travel by increasing energy efficiency and investing in 
renewable energy and carbon offset projects.

We accomplished this, purchasing over 3.2 billion kWh of 
green power and seeking to purchase green power in the 
same markets as our operations wherever available. 

•  Further increasing our direct purchases of 

renewable energy.

Goal: Expanding our global data collection and reporting 
of waste and water data.

Microsoft on sustainability solutions for cities through 
Microsoft’s CityNext initiative.

•  Expanding our ecosystem of partners working with 

We expanded our global collection and reporting of waste 
data and continue working to enhance our reporting of 
water data.

Goal: Maintaining our commitment to achieving carbon 
neutrality and net-zero emissions for our datacenters, soft-
ware development labs, offices, and employee air travel 
by increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable 
energy and carbon offset projects.

We met these commitments in FY15 and expanded the 
program to also address Microsoft-owned manufacturing 
facilities in FY16.

Goal: Establishing targets with business groups to improve 
operational energy efficiency.

Our Real Estate & Facilities group set energy efficiency 
targets and water use targets for our large campuses 
that represent approximately 80 percent of our campus 
energy use.

Goal: Building on the model of our 110-MW Keechi Wind 
power purchase agreement with additional large-scale 
commitments to purchase renewable energy.

Beyond our Keechi Wind power purchase agreement, in 
FY15 we signed a 60 percent larger wind power purchase 
agreement to catalyze development of the new Pilot Hill 
Wind Power Project.
