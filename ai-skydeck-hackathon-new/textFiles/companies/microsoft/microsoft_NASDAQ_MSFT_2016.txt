In this year’s annual letter to shareholders, I devoted my closing thoughts to the 
important role technology can play in spreading economic opportunity more 
evenly around the world. I believe we must continue to dedicate ourselves to the 
challenges humankind faces, the role technology can play, and the unique contri-
butions Microsoft can make.

We live in a time of digital transformation. Breakthroughs in data, cloud com-
puting and artificial intelligence will advance health, education, communications, 
individual empowerment and economic growth around the world. We have a 
responsibility to ensure everyone benefits, not just a few. To truly live up to our 
mission, we must make a quantifiable difference in the lives of everyone, every-
where.

The impact of today’s far-reaching and rapid change creates its own challeng-
es for business and society. When I meet with government leaders around the 
globe, they raise concerns about the online and physical safety of their citizens, 
as well as the long-term future of work and economic growth for those commu-
nities most at risk.

To address those urgent concerns, we are working with policymakers and industry 
partners around the world to harness the social and economic benefits of cloud 
computing in a way that ensures the promise of technology can be used to ben-
efit everyone, not just the fortunate few. We’ve defined this aim as a cloud for 
global good: one that’s trusted, responsible and inclusive.

As we share these ideas with others, we recognize these concepts start at home. 
This past year we released enhanced privacy principles and actively fought for the 
rights of our users against unreasonable government surveillance. We work to 
make our cloud responsible and accountable with protections for online safety, 
work to balance privacy and free expression with public security, and are commit-
ted to operating a carbon-neutral cloud that is increasingly powered directly with 
renewable energy. And we work to make our cloud inclusive with investments to 
expand affordable internet connectivity, build next-generation skills, and ensure 
the accessibility of our technologies.

We took further steps to spread economic opportunity to every corner of the 
planet this past year with Microsoft Philanthropies’ three-year commitment to 
donate $1 billion in public cloud computing for nonprofits around the world. 
Already, we’re seeing progress. Nonprofits big and small are tapping Microsoft 
cloud services to accelerate their own digital transformation and have an even 
bigger impact on the communities they serve.

One nonprofit partner taking advantage of Microsoft’s cloud services, CONIN, 
is working to eradicate child malnutrition in Salta, a remote region in Argentina. 
CONIN uses Microsoft Azure to more deeply understand on-the-ground real-
ities and pinpoint those families and children at greatest risk. An app in Azure 
triggers an alert whenever the nonprofit- and government-run community census 
identifies a child in need. Now it is able to reach more at-risk families with better 
solutions before they fall through the cracks.

Another Microsoft Philanthropies grantee using our cloud is FIRST Robotics, a 
small U.S.-based nonprofit that provides robotics education and experience to 
youth across the country. With a limited budget and a tiny engineering staff, 
FIRST Robotics uses Azure to harness the power of big data to strategically chan-
nel resources where they are needed most, freeing up precious staff time to help 
more students develop real-world technology skills and create the next gener-
ation of STEM leaders. And we’re making cloud services available to all eligible 
nonprofits.

In addition to our work to promote a trusted, responsible and inclusive cloud, 
we also continued our focus on advancing young people’s access to education 
and opportunity through our YouthSpark program. Last year we committed to 
invest $75 million over three years in programs to increase access to computer 
science education for all youth, and especially those from under-represented 
backgrounds. We are well on track to meet that commitment, with $28 million 
invested in FY16.

I’m also deeply humbled and inspired by the generosity of our employees. In 
FY16, Microsoft employees contributed $133 million to more than 18,000 nonprof-
its worldwide through our matching funds employee giving program. That’s in 
addition to the more than $1 billion in technology donations Microsoft provided 
to more than 100,000 nonprofit organizations around the world.

I’ve often said that our customers and society expect us to maximize the value 
of technology and deliver the latest innovations while also preserving timeless 
values such as privacy, security and opportunity. Our work to promote a cloud for 
global good reflects that dynamic balance, as does many of our other commit-
ments to corporate social responsibility.
That commitment also includes being transparent in how we report our progress 
and performance so that others can judge for themselves how we’re doing. The 
report that follows details our progress over the past decade-plus and outlines 
our principles and the high expectations we have set for ourselves, and that our 
customers and the communities we serve expect from us.

It is truly amazing what we can accomplish when employees, customers and part-
ners in both the public and private sectors come together with a shared sense 
of purpose. We welcome your interest, feedback and partnership as we continue 
our work to ensure the digital transformation underway includes and empowers 
everyone and opens doors to opportunity for those who need it most.

Sincerely,

Satya Nadella
Chief Executive Officer

At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person and every

We work to earn the consistent trust and con-
fidence of the public, our customers, partners, 
employees and shareholders.

At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person and every organization on 
the planet to achieve more. To realize that mission requires more than providing 
products and services that let our customers do great things. It requires us to be 
thoughtful about the impact of our own business practices, policies, and invest-
ments in communities.

We know that our decisions can affect our employees, customers, partners, share-
holders, suppliers, and communities. So, we seek to ensure that their voices are 
considered as we make decisions. Microsoft gets input from millions of people 
each year, ranging from individual customers to policymakers and global human 
rights specialists.

Overview

Stakeholder engagement

And it’s not a mission we can achieve alone. It requires partnerships to apply our 
technologies to address some of the world’s toughest challenges.

In short, we see corporate responsibility as both a responsibility and an opportu-
nity to work together to advance technology and societal needs at the same time.

The charter for the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of our Board of 
Directors includes the responsibility to “review and provide guidance to the board 
and management about the company’s policies and programs that relate to cor-
porate citizenship, including human rights, environmental sustainability, corporate 
social responsibility, supply chain management, charitable giving, and political 
activities and expenditures.”

Microsoft’s Business and Corporate Responsibility (BCR) team is part of our Cor-
porate, External, and Legal Affairs group. BCR works in collaboration with leaders 
across Microsoft’s business and operations to help us consistently earn the trust 
and confidence of the public, our customers, partners, employees and share-
holders. The Corporate Vice President of Business and Corporate Responsibility 
reports directly to Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer, who reports to 
CEO Satya Nadella and sits on Microsoft’s Senior Leadership Team.

Learn more about the committee of the Board of Directors responsible for overseeing the company’s 
policies and programs, including public policy and corporate citizenship.

We bring outside perspectives into the company and inform our business deci-
sions through a variety of feedback channels. In addition to using formal chan-
nels, we proactively engage and talk to key stakeholders, advocacy groups, widely 
recognized experts, CSR rating agencies and CSR-focused investors, and many 
others. We also work to share our learnings and practices to generate industry 
dialogue, inform public debate, and advance greater progress.

Responsibility shows the types of stakeholders we engage, how we engage with them, and examples of

Alignment with global standards and 
reporting frameworks

Microsoft works to align our CSR commitments and CSR reporting with relevant 
global standards:

• We endorsed the United Nations Global Compact in 2006 and file an annual 
Communication on Progress implementing the UNGC’s 10 principles.

• We were among the first companies to align our human rights work with the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to adopt the UN Guiding 
Principles Reporting Framework.

• We are actively engaged in supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

• We base our CSR reporting on the Global Reporting Initiatives’ Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines.

CSR materiality assessment

Corporate responsibility experts increasingly call on companies to focus their re-
porting on “material CSR issues,” though they differ on how they define the term.

We apply the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 
to our CSR materiality assessment to define our most significant CSR issues as 
those ranking highest in both business importance to Microsoft and in impor-
tance to our key stakeholders. This aligns with how we set our CSR strategies and 
commitments to drive positive impact to our business and to society.

Beyond this analysis, our President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, clearly 
articulated how we prioritize our CSR issues and their link to our business success 
in a keynote speech at the launch of A Cloud for Global Good, where he noted:

• Technology is creating new jobs, but automation can challenge and even 
replace some traditional jobs. There are new challenges to privacy rights. here 
are new questions about income inequality. There are new opportunities but also 
challenges for people with disabilities.

We identified the top citizenship issues, using this approach. It reflects input gath-
ered from our stakeholder engagement processes, consultation with Business for 
Social Responsibility (BSR) and other external experts, and consideration of the 
impact that Microsoft’s core businesses have.

• If we don’t acknowledge explicitly, at the outset, that this new era creates both 
opportunity and challenge, the truth is we’ll do less than we should to make the 
most of the promise that lies ahead. We need to ensure that we move technology 
forward without leaving people behind.

Top issues:

• Access to technology and economic opportunity

• Climate change and energy

• Corporate governance

• Data privacy and security

• Device lifecycle impacts

• Environmental/social applications of technology

• Ethical business practices

• Human capital

• Human rights

• Responsible sourcing and manufacturing

• This requires that we accept a sense of shared responsibility. Those of us who 
work in the tech sector and the private sector have an important role and re-
sponsibility, as do people across civil society, and as do governments around the 
world.

• To fulfill that responsibility, we need to ensure that the cloud is trusted, respon-
sible and inclusive. Microsoft’s efforts here include:

     o Our human rights commitments, and our commitments to privacy  
        and data security work to ensure that our cloud is trusted.

     o Our commitments to environmental sustainability, responsible  
        sourcing, and empowering our employees to ensure that our cloud is  
        responsible.

     o And our commitments to accessibility, global diversity and inclusion,           
and empowering communities to ensure that our cloud is inclusive.

Human rights are the inherent rights that belong 
to all people. At Microsoft, we endeavor to 
respect and champion human rights in the way 
we do business. And we work with some of 
the world’s leading human rights organizations 
to apply the power of technology to advance 
human rights.

The Microsoft Global Human Rights Statement 
details our commitment to respect and promote 
human rights. Read the full statement

Microsoft revised its Global Human Rights Statement in 2016 to reflect changes to 
our business, and to meet our increased standards and responsibility to respect 
human rights. The revisions were developed through:

• An assessment process with the internal teams that are responsible for our 
salient and supplemental human rights issues

• Discussions with external subject matter experts who are closely associated with 
Microsoft or the field of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and human 
rights

• Review and approval by Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer

In addition to being publicly available in twelve languages, the Statement is 
shared among all employees globally through our Standards of Business Con-
duct. The Standards are based on Microsoft’s values and continued commitment 
to ethical business practices and legal compliance, which applies to all employ-
ees, directors, and executive officers of Microsoft and its subsidiaries and Con-
trolled Affiliates. Employee compliance with the Standards of Business Conduct is 
reinforced through annual, corporate-wide, online training.

Our commitment

Since 2006, Microsoft has had a formal commitment to respect human rights as a 
signatory of the United Nations Global Compact.

The Global Compact is the most widely recognized corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) framework for businesses to respect human rights and labor rights, and to 
ensure environmental protection and combat corruption. Microsoft enhanced this 
commitment when we published our Global Human Rights Statement in 2012.

Our Global Human Rights Statement is itself grounded in the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which establishes that in their 
work to respect human rights, companies “should avoid infringing on the rights 
of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are 
involved.” This is now a global standard of conduct expected of all businesses.

Our Statement explains our intention to respect the rights defined in:

Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 

International Labour Organization’s Declaration of Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work 

To achieve our mission of empowering every individual and every organization, 
we recognize that some human rights and some specific groups require a special 
focus. Several conventions help Microsoft identify how we can better support 
some of the world’s most vulnerable groups and the extra efforts we can take to 
maintain their trust. These include:

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 

Convention on the Rights of the Child 

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 

Our approach

All human rights are indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated: The improve-
ment of one right enables advancement of others.

We recognize that there are additional areas where we must support the needs of 
rights holders. We regard these as our supplemental human rights issues:

Our human rights-based approach to business recognizes that rights-holders are 
individuals – real people, from all communities – who have rights that Microsoft 
must respect. Rights-holders are also considered to be our partners in the realiza-
tion of human rights, either directly or through representative organizations.

Microsoft is a diverse, worldwide business with billions of users and customers. 
We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, 
and devices. We have over 100,000 employees and tens of thousands of suppliers. 
We touch a vast spectrum of rights holders and their needs.

Businesses are expected to determine their salient human rights, which are de-
fined as the rights “at risk of the most severe negative impact through the com-
pany’s activities and business relationships.” Determining our salient human rights 
allows us to act on and report on the most critical human rights needs connected 
with our business.

Microsoft’s salient human rights issues are:

• Accessibility: Creating and delivering technology that is accessible and func-
tional for people of all abilities.

Learn more about our commitment to accessibility 

• Online safety: Protecting the safety and security of vulnerable groups online.

Find resources and research about online safety 

• Freedom of expression and privacy: Respecting peoples’ right to freedom of 
expression and their right to freedom from arbitrary and unlawful interference 
with privacy online.

Learn about our work to advance freedom of expression 

• Privacy and data security: Incorporating privacy considerations into our design 
and development processes, offering our customers meaningful privacy choices, 
and responsibly collecting, managing, and using the customer data that we store.

Discover more about our commitment to privacy and data security 

• Responsible sourcing: Upholding ethical business, employment, environmen-
tal, and worker safety practices in our global supply chains.

• Corporate governance and ethics: Sharing ethical behavior and acting with 
integrity in everything we do.

• Diversity and inclusion: Creating a global workforce and culture without dis-
crimination.

• Philanthropy: Empowering communities by implementing our philanthropic 
activities worldwide, led by our Microsoft Philanthropies group.

Learn how we determine and understand our salient and supplemental human 
rights issues.

Microsoft’s strategy for the future is to build best-in-class platforms and produc-
tivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world.

As such, Microsoft is investing in three integrated ambitions:

• Reinventing productivity and business processes

• Building the intelligent cloud platform that is trusted, responsible, and inclusive 
of everyone

• Creating more personal computing

As Microsoft adapts and grows within the changing ICT landscape, we expect our 
salient and supplemental human rights issues to remain consistent in the near 
term, and we will continue to monitor the salience and importance of our human 
rights issues so that we maintain an appropriate focus.

Crucially, our salient human rights issues are a mixture of challenges. Some relate 
to our own business conduct, while other issues relate to third-parties misusing 
our products and services, or actions of governments restricting freedom of ex-
pression or demands that conflict with privacy rights. Our responsibility to respect 
human rights requires us to act upon impacts we are associated with. Therefore, 
in addition to respecting human rights within our own business conduct, it is 
also important that we apply leverage wherever possible to maximize respect for 
rights holders.

Human rights governance

Microsoft’s internal governance on human rights issues seeks to ensure that our 
human rights commitments are met across our global and diverse business. We 
achieve that commitment through:

• Shared responsibility: Everyone within our business, including our partners, 
has a responsibility to respect human rights. This responsibility is established in 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and is reflected in the 
Microsoft Global Human Rights Statement.

• Focus on impact: Across our company, we have teams with dedicated respon-
sibility to drive decisions that demonstrate respect for customers’ and end users’ 
human rights. These teams have an immediate impact on rights holders by 
ensuring that their needs are reflected throughout Microsoft’s products, opera-
tions, and partnerships as a result of the policies and management systems they 
establish in product or service design, sales, business and employment practices, 
and by working with rights holders to achieve the realization of their rights.

Two groups with the greatest focus on Microsoft’s salient human rights issues 
both report directly to Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer:

• The Business and Corporate Responsibility Team (BCR) houses our policy 
efforts towards meeting our accessibility commitments and privacy.

• The Regulatory Affairs Team houses our policy efforts towards meeting free-
dom of expression commitments and our online safety standards.

Many groups within Microsoft manage our broad range of supplemental human 
rights issues. The Microsoft Philanthropies team and our business ethics and 
anti-corruption work sit within the Corporate, External and Legal Affairs (CELA) 
group. The responsible sourcing program supports both the Windows and 
Devices Group (WDG), which is responsible for Microsoft’s software platform, 
apps, games, store and devices that power the Windows ecosystem, and the 
Global Procurement Group, which sources the goods and services supplied to the 
Microsoft business. The topic of global diversity and inclusion in our workforce is 
managed by the Human Resources division, which implements the policies and 
programs to recruit, retain, and develop employees and to advance our cultural 
transformation.

• Programs and centers of expertise manage Microsoft’s human rights program 
by providing business guidance on human rights in the form of policies, due 
diligence, training, and transparency.

Within Business and Corporate Responsibility, the Corporate and Social Respon-
sibility Team (CSR) houses our human rights program management, responsible 
sourcing, transparency and reporting, and coordination of our overall engage-
ment with key international organizations including United Nations agencies. The 
CSR Team also operates the Microsoft Technology and Human Rights Center. The 
Center prioritizes and coordinates human rights due diligence, identifies emerg-
ing risks and opportunities related to human rights, and promotes harmonized 
approaches to human rights across Microsoft. The Center also fosters dialogue to 
advance understanding of the human rights impacts of ICT. Through the Center, 
Microsoft engages with a broad range of human rights groups, academics, and 
industry groups globally to share Microsoft’s experiences and lessons learned.

The work of the Technology & Human Rights Center is amplified by Microsoft’s 
CELA group, led by the President, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance 
Officer of Microsoft. This group includes more than 1,300 business, legal, and 
corporate affairs professionals in 55 countries who are responsible for Microsoft’s 
legal, intellectual property portfolio, patent licensing, philanthropic, government 
affairs, public policy, corporate governance, and social responsibility work.

Privacy in design and development

We offer our users meaningful privacy choices, and we responsibly manage and 
protect the customer data that we store.

In 2016 we updated our company-wide Privacy Principles and the Microsoft Pri-
vacy Statement to communicate how seriously we approach matters of privacy 
at Microsoft and the effort we make to protect our customers’ personal data and 
their right to privacy.

Learn more about our Privacy Principles 

Read our Privacy Statement 

Our commitment to privacy is based on six core principles:

Control
We put users in control of their privacy with easy-to-use tools and clear choices.

Transparency
We are transparent with users about data collection so that they can make in-
formed decisions.

Security
We protect the data users entrust to us through strong security and encryption.

Strong legal protections
We respect our customers’ local privacy laws and fight for the legal protection of 
privacy as a fundamental human right.

No content-based targeting
We do not use customer email, chat, files, or other personal content to target ads.

The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) has recognized us for 
having the ‘second largest number of certified privacy professionals (CIPP) of any 
company.

Dedicated privacy professionals are embedded into each of our product and ser-
vice groups. These professionals help our groups to incorporate privacy consider-
ations into our design and development processes. This is one of the many ways 
we demonstrate our commitment to customer security and privacy.

We’ve also been among the first in our industry to adopt a number of privacy 
protections. These include:

• Making the commitment to not scan email services for the purposes of target-
ing online advertising.

• Being one of the first companies to sign the Student Privacy Pledge. This pledge 
was developed by the Future of Privacy Forum and the Software & Information 
Industry Association to establish a common set of principles to protect the priva-
cy of student information.

• Adopting, with independent verification, the world’s first international standard 
for cloud privacy (ISO/IEC 27018). This standard, developed by the International 
Organization for Standardization, establishes a uniform, international approach to 
protecting privacy for personal data stored in the cloud.

• Being among the first companies certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield pro-
gram.

We’ve also created new processes to help put victims back in control of their on-
line imagery and their privacy, with a new approach to non-consensual pornogra-
phy on our consumer services.

Addressing government information 
requests

We do not provide any government with direct and unfettered access to our 
customers’ data, nor do we provide ‘back door’ access.

As we have publicly disclosed, if a government wants our customers’ data, it must 
serve us with the appropriate warrant, court order, or subpoena targeted at spe-
cific accounts and identifiers. We reject requests that don’t meet these require-
ments, and we only provide the data specified in the legal order.

Our transparency practices help to protect your privacy.

We are transparent about how we handle government requests for user informa-
tion in a series of Law Enforcement Requests Reports and National Security 
Request Reports that we publish every six months. To expand the information 
that we can legally share in those reports, we brought and settled a suit with the 
U.S. government allowing us to disclose the number of legal national security 
requests we receive. We currently have a case pending against the U.S. govern-
ment challenging the growing number of search warrants with secrecy orders 
that would prohibit us forever from letting users know that the government had 
obtained their e-mail.

Read our Law Enforcement Requests Reports 

Read our National Security Requests Reports 

We are working to reform government surveillance practices.

To stand up for our users’ rights, we and others in our industry are pushing for 
reform in government surveillance. We have publicly advocated that govern-
ments must create a new international legal framework to ensure that govern-
ments seek information about private citizens of other participating countries 
only pursuant to legal rules and due process. We successfully challenged an effort 
by the U.S. government to use search warrants unilaterally to reach beyond U.S. 
borders.

This legal victory is important for three reasons. It ensures that:

• People’s privacy rights are protected by the laws of their own countries.

• The legal protections of the physical world apply in the digital domain.

• Better solutions to address both privacy and law enforcement needs can be 
developed in the future.

Corporate governance

Through oversight, review, and counsel, Microsoft’s Board of Directors establishes 
and promotes our business and organizational objectives.

Corporate governance at Microsoft:

• Establishes and preserves management accountability to company owners by 
appropriately distributing rights and responsibilities among Board members, 
managers, and shareholders.

• Board and committee evaluations

• Shareholder engagement

• Risk oversight

Learn more about Microsoft’s Board and its committees 

• Provides a structure for management and the Board to set objectives and mon-
itor performance.

Shareholder engagement

• Strengthens and safeguards our culture of business integrity and responsible 
business practices.

• Encourages the efficient use of resources, and requires accountability for stew-
ardship of those resources.

Microsoft believes that effective corporate governance should include regular, 
constructive conversations with our shareholders. We actively engage with our 
shareholders as part of our annual corporate governance cycle. Communicating 
governance policies and practices to all shareholders and other stakeholders is an 
important part of our commitment to transparency. With over 3.5 million Micro-
soft shareholders, using both direct dialogue and ‘one-to-many’ communications 
are necessary to reach all shareholders.

Our progressive corporate governance framework

Learn more about our Shareholder Outreach and Corporate Governance Cycle  

Our corporate governance framework is designed to ensure our Board has the 
necessary authority and practices in place to review and evaluate our business 
operations and to make decisions independent of management. Our goal is to 
align the interests of directors, management, and shareholders, and comply with 
or exceed the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and applicable law. This 
framework establishes the practices our Board follows with respect to:

• Board composition, director selection and director compensation

• Board refreshment and succession planning

• Independent Board leadership

Policies and guidelines

Corporate governance at Microsoft is designed to promote the long-term 
interests of our shareholders, maintain internal checks and balances, strengthen 
management accountability, inspire public trust, and foster responsible decision 
making and accountability. Our corporate governance framework consists of our 
Articles, Bylaws, and a set of policies and guidelines. The Board routinely reviews 
evolving practices to determine those practices that will best serve the interests of 
our shareholders.

Ethics and standards of business 
conduct

Building a fabric of trust is paramount to realizing our mission to empower every 
person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Business conduct and compliance program

We build trust by making ethical choices and acting with integrity in our dealings 
with customers, partners, competitors, shareholders, suppliers, representatives, 
regulatory agencies, and government officials. We are committed to engaging all 
of these groups in a respectful, ethical manner and in compliance with all legal 
requirements. Trust is fundamental to succeeding in our ambitions to reinvent 
productivity and business processes, build the intelligent cloud platform, and 
create more personal computing.

We apply our rigorous code of conduct to everything we do.

Microsoft’s Standards of Business Conduct are the foundation of our commitment 
to ethical business practices and legal compliance. Our Standards of Business 
Conduct help us live our values, which include fulfilling our commitment to the 
highest ethical and legal behavior. These standards are endorsed by the Microsoft 
Board of Directors and apply to all employees, directors, and executive officers of 
Microsoft and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates (where Microsoft directly or 
indirectly owns more than 50 percent of the voting control).

Learn what our CEO, Satya Nadella, has to say about our Standards of Business 
Conduct 

Training our employees in ethical business decision-making helps ensure high 
standards of conduct

All Microsoft employees must complete annual training on our Standards of 
Business Conduct. The training course is available in 16 languages. In FY16, as in 
previous years, we achieved a completion rate for the course of greater than 99 
percent. In addition, a variety of mandatory role-specific trainings address the 
compliance risks of particular roles and business functions, and Microsoft pro-
vides employees with a wide range of additional optional training and guidance 
to ensure awareness of our policies and expectations for ethical behavior.

Microsoft’s Office of Legal Compliance is responsible for our Business Conduct 
and Compliance Program, working closely with the rest of Microsoft Corporate, 
External and Legal Affairs, Finance, Human Resources, Internal Audit, and other 
groups focused on ensuring compliance. We have more than 50 people whose 
primary role is investigating potential breaches of company policy, and an addi-
tional 120 people whose primary role is compliance. In addition, we sometimes 
retain outside law firms to conduct or assist with investigations. This is a reflection 
of the size and complexity of our business and the seriousness with which we 
take meeting our obligations.

Across Microsoft, we:

• Promote a culture of ethics and integrity

• Build, enhance, and monitor internal controls to identify and mitigate risks of 
unethical and non-compliant conduct.

• Perform regular internal audits.

• Require multiple levels of approval for contracting and expenditures.

• Maintain internal compliance scorecards that affect key leaders’ performance 
compensation.

• Train our employees.

• Identify, investigate, and remediate concerns, risks, and improper conduct.

• Require partners and suppliers to adhere to the highest standards of ethical 
behavior and regulatory compliance.

To support our compliance program, we make it easy for employees and third 
parties to report for any compliance concerns, using easy-to-access reporting 
methods. These include the following:

• Calling a toll-free telephone integrity hotline that is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week by a third-party vendor (operators are available to receive calls in 49 
languages).

• Submitting an online report through a publicly available website (www.micro-
softintegrity.com) operated by the vendor (the landing page for the site is in 16 
languages and the online reporting tool is in 37 languages).

• Emailing the Office of Legal Compliance directly at buscond@microsoft.com.

• Calling, writing, or faxing the Office of Legal Compliance directly.

Retaliation is prohibited (Safe to Report)

Preventing retaliation is critical to the Business Conduct and Compliance Pro-
gram. Microsoft maintains and communicates a non-retaliation policy that strictly 
prohibits retaliation against complainants who raise a compliance concern in 
good faith or refuse to do something that violates Microsoft’s Standards of 
Business Conduct, policies, or the law, even if the refusal results in the loss of 
business to Microsoft. Microsoft is committed to handling all inquiries discreetly 
and making every effort to maintain confidentiality or anonymity within the limits 
allowed by the laws.

Anti-corruption

We prohibit corruption of government officials and the payment of bribes or kick-
backs of any kind. This applies whether in dealings with public officials or individ-
uals in the private sector.

We have the highest possible standards for ethical conduct.

Microsoft’s Standards of Business Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy for Repre-
sentatives include strong commitments to observing the standards of conduct set 
forth in the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the applicable anti-corruption 
laws of all the countries in which we operate.

We expect our partners to comply with our ethical standards.

While conducting business with Microsoft customers, Microsoft expects its Part-
ners to commit to operating in full compliance with all applicable laws and regu-
lations, and to adhere to the principles outlined in the Partner Code of Conduct.

Microsoft provides all partners with a free, online anti-corruption training course, 
in multiple languages. Partners must provide their own anti-corruption training or 
Microsoft’s training to their employees.

Microsoft also expects its Suppliers to commit to operating in full compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations, and to adhere to the principles outlined 
in the Supplier Code of Conduct. Microsoft’s Supplier Code of Conduct includes 
strong ethics and anti-corruption provisions, which are highlighted in an online 
Supplier Code of Conduct Training that suppliers must take and is available in 
multiple languages.

We engage only with legitimate businesses.

Beyond clearly communicating our expectations, Microsoft vets certain partners 
and suppliers to help ensure that we only engage legitimate businesses with 
a reputation for integrity. We conduct risk assessment to identify higher-risk 
representative types, which were then vetted along with many other representa-
tive types. This includes channel partners, consultants, lobbyists, and other third 
parties engaged by Microsoft and its subsidiaries and joint ventures worldwide. In 
addition, we continue to have third-party reviews conducted for all new suppli-
ers. Since the vetting program’s inception, Microsoft has screened nearly 100,000 
representatives and suppliers to enable Microsoft to monitor the risk profile and 
drive risk mitigation efforts accordingly.

Policy agenda

In October 2016, Microsoft launched a cloud policy roadmap that seeks to maxi-
mize the opportunities and minimize the challenges that cloud computing brings. 
This roadmap covers fifteen policy areas and provides a comprehensive set of 78 
recommendations and considerations grounded in three core principles: We need 
a trusted cloud; we need a responsible cloud; and we need an inclusive cloud to 
ensure nobody is left behind.

The roadmap presents our perspectives on policies to harness the social and 
economic benefits of cloud computing to benefit everyone, not just the fortunate 
few. It outlines policies to ensure cloud computing is:

• Trusted with policies addressing personal privacy, government access to data, 
cross-border data flows, and cybercrime prevention.

• The Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of the Microsoft Board of Directors 
is responsible for overseeing the company’s public policy work and related activi-
ties. The committee receives regular, formal reports.

• Management of our participation in the political process in the United States is 
the responsibility of the Vice President for US Government Affairs, who reports 
directly to Microsoft’s General Counsel, who reports to the company CEO.

• The Microsoft Political Action Committee (MSPAC) Steering Committee, a bipar-
tisan committee of Microsoft federal and state government affairs professionals, 
is responsible for oversight and day-to-day decision making related to political 
spending. Oversight of the committee spans corporate fund expenditures as well 
as employee and shareholder donations made via the MSPAC program.

Microsoft requires that those individuals who recommend corporate political 
contributions in the United States certify as to their knowledge of and adherence 
to these policies and practices. Outside ethics counsel reviews and approves all 
MSPAC and corporate political giving activities, filings, reports, and materials. Mi-
crosoft publishes MSPAC and corporate political spending reports semi-annually 
on the corporate website.

More about MSPAC

MSPAC Committee Members

Microsoft sponsors MSPAC to enable Microsoft employees and shareholders to 
participate more effectively in the U.S. political process. The committee, created 
in 1988, informs its members about important issues and government decisions 
that can affect Microsoft business. It also provides an opportunity for members 
to collectively support public policy positions that are important to Microsoft and 
the software industry.

As a bipartisan organization that contributes to the campaigns of federal, state, 
and local candidates, MSPAC typically supports candidates who share Microsoft’s 
views on public policy, serve as congressional or legislative leaders, represent dis-
tricts or states where Microsoft has a major business presence, or serve on com-
mittees that have jurisdiction over legislation that is important to the company.

The MSPAC Steering Committee evaluates candidates’ public policy positions on 
issues that are relevant to Microsoft business or are of particular interest to the 
computer software industry. The committee—composed of senior managers in 
Legal and Corporate Affairs at Microsoft—then decides which candidates and 
campaigns MSPAC will support.

Under these policies, we commit to disclosing a semi-annual list of election cam-
paign expenditures, including financial and in-kind contributions by the company 
and MSPAC to candidates, political parties, political committees, and other po-
litically active tax-exempt organizations, such as those organized under Internal 
Revenue Code section 501(c)(4), as defined by applicable laws.

To uphold our commitment to the transparency of our political spending and 
contributions, we do not make corporate contributions to any non-candidate or 
non-party political committees organized under section 527 of the Internal Rev-
enue Code, which are formed solely to influence elections. We also make no in-
dependent political expenditures or electioneering communications, as permitted 
under the US Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling, and we inform our trade 
associations that no Microsoft funds may pay for their independent expenditures 
or electioneering communications.

contributions, and trade association memberships, please visit the 2016 Reports Hub.

Trade association membership contributions

Like all major corporations, Microsoft is a member of a number of trade asso-
ciations (organized under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code) in the 
United States to help advance our public policy agenda and related business 
goals. We publicly disclose and update annually a list of those trade associations 
to which Microsoft pays dues and makes other expenditures through our Legal & 
Community Affairs group. Each year, Microsoft inquires and makes a reasonable 
effort to obtain information about what portion of the company’s dues or pay-
ments were used for lobbying expenditures or political contributions from those 
associations where our dues and other expenditures total $25,000 or more. This 
information is publicly disclosed and updated annually.

them.

Our commitment

Microsoft sets high standards for responsible business practices among our sup-
pliers. We work hard to help our suppliers meet them.

Microsoft has relationships with thousands of suppliers around the globe, span-
ning both hardware suppliers that manufacture our devices and the compo-
nents that go into them and indirect suppliers that provide everything from 
advertising services to building construction and maintenance.

Regardless of the type, we expect all suppliers who do business with Microsoft to 
uphold the human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental, and business 
ethics practices prescribed in our Supplier Code of Conduct. This code aligns 
with, and in certain cases exceeds, the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition’s 
(EICC’s) responsible supply chain standards. The Supplier Code of Conduct and 
other Social and Environmental related requirements are incorporated into our 
supplier contracts.

• We advance our responsible sourcing commitments through:

• Analysis of risks and opportunities

• Assurance and accountability

• Capacity building

• Creating shared value

Microsoft’s Device Supply Chain group (DSC) and indirect purchasing group over-
see dedicated programs to ensure that our standards are met and to build part-
nerships with suppliers that advance social and environmental goals. For example:

• Since 2005, Microsoft’s Device and Supply Chain group has operated an indus-
try-leading Social and Environmental Accountability (SEA) program to ensure that 
our hardware and packaging suppliers conform to our Supplier Code of Conduct 
and additional device-related requirements for living conditions, safe working 
practices, and environmental, health, and safety protection. DSC also operates 
the DSC Environmental Management System (EMS), a cross-company, ISO 14001 
certified environmental management system that applies to all aspects of Mic-
rosoft’s hardware and packaging manufacturing supply chain, management and 
operations.

• Microsoft’s Global Procurement Group created a formal responsible sourcing 
function in 2013 to consolidate and enhance its responsible sourcing activities 
with our indirect suppliers (our suppliers outside those that make our hardware 
devices and the components and raw materials that go into them.)

Microsoft also recognizes the role we play to enable and empower people to 
achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In the Microsoft Device Supply 
Chain group, we outline the contributions we have made in the last year towards 
meeting the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN to improve people’s 
quality of life, protect the environment, and foster equitable growth.

Risk Assessment

We approach our efforts around responsible sourcing based on the social and 
environmental opportunity and risk in our supply chain.

Microsoft production supplier locations

We apply a risk-based approach to focus our efforts across our global base of 
suppliers, considering but not limited to the following:

• Their social and environmental risks

• Our spend and influence with them

• Their connection to our products and services

We also ask our suppliers to disclose the material composition for 100 percent of 
each device and packaging component they provide us. Today more than 100,000 
device and packaging components have been evaluated for compliance. In addi-
tion, our Microsoft’s Device Supply Chain group suppliers are required to provide 
validation test results showing compliance with all global substance restrictions 
per our specifications. This digital data set is accessed by software that provides 
product-specific analyses of key metrics. This smart database allows us to use 
environmental engineering time efficiently to track and eliminate substances 
according to global regulations, market requirements, and our voluntary efforts. 
This process is a gating item in all new product development.

To monitor and evaluate the Microsoft Device Supply Chain group’s social and 
environmental performance of our suppliers we use an Audit Management Sys-
tem (AMS) built using Microsoft technologies/tools: Visual Studio, Visual Studio 
Team Services, Microsoft.NET, Azure SQL, and Azure blob storage. The tool is 
hosted on Microsoft Azure. Using Microsoft Power BI with AMS provides the abil-
ity to build greater visual insight into the data. The AMS allows us to have “one 
source of truth” and, with the use of workflows, has enhanced our audit database 
of supplier sustainability assessments to allow for better analysis of corrective 
actions and individual and cumulative results.

Recognizing the vast number of raw materials and the complexity of our supply 
chain, Microsoft uses a risk-based approach to assess our raw material sourcing. 
This considers the following dimensions: risk to Microsoft’s supply chain, ma-
terial-specific social and environmental risks and Microsoft’s ability to influence 
and impact production of those materials to assess and prioritize addressing the 
social and environmental risks associated with raw materials.

Over the past several years, we also enhanced how we assess and manage social 
and environmental risks across the full range of our indirect suppliers. Micro-
soft screens our non-hardware suppliers against 23 different ethical, social, and 
environmental risks by country and by commodity category. We apply assurance 
requirements for suppliers found to pose the highest risks. Among these, we have 
dedicated supplier training and assurance programs related to anti-corruption, 
privacy, and security.

Microsoft sparked the creation of the Committee on Supplier Ratings, a new 
collaborative effort designed to help purchasers engage indirect suppliers on 
sustainability issues by leveraging a range of respected company rating systems.

Accountability

We engage our directly-contracted hardware packaging suppliers, and our indi-

We systematically engage all of our contracted hardware and packaging sup-
pliers with the goal to move them from compliance, to self-management, to an 
embrace of a culture that fosters social and environmental accountability.

Each of our suppliers is expected to demonstrate compliance with all applicable 
laws, regulations, and our specifications. To ensure continuous performance, sup-
pliers must evolve their focus from reactive risk management to the development 
of strong management systems, and progression to a preventive mindset. This 
transformation allows them to proactively mitigate risks, monitor performance, 
and continuously improve.

Ultimately, we want our suppliers to institute a Social and Environmental Account-
ability (SEA) culture by integrating SEA into their overall business management. 
This involves engagement at all levels of the supplier organization and making 
SEA part of their company DNA.

This approach spans multiple tiers of our directly contracted sup-
pliers:

• Tier 1 suppliers: Manufacturing partners with whom Microsoft has a direct 
contractual relationship. They manufacture Microsoft hardware components and 
products.

• Contracted Tier 2 suppliers: Suppliers with whom Microsoft has a direct con-
tractual relationship to provide components or materials to our Tier 1 suppliers.

• We also require contracted suppliers to ensure that their direct suppliers con-
form to our specifications, which allows Microsoft to indirectly push its principles 
further upstream to sub-tier suppliers with whom we do not have contractual 
relationships.

DSC Manufacturing, Strategic Sourcing, and SEA teams work with our suppliers to 
ensure that the corrective action plans to remedy audit and assessment findings 
address the identified risks and root causes and are implemented in a timely 
manner. Follow-up audits are conducted to ensure that corrective actions are 
implemented and closed.

Where needed, we also provide suppliers with best practices to help them build 
necessary capabilities and apply sustainable solutions to identified issues. Our 
primary motivation is to push for continuous improvement of the SEA program 
and supplier performance. Where improvement is not possible, we may restrict 
further business to the factory and phase out the factory from our active supplier 
list.

Microsoft is dedicated to achieving extended, responsible sourcing strategies 
by building capabilities in and partnering with NGOs, the electronics industry 
sector, and other industry sectors. We believe collaboration is the best avenue to 
establish global, and industry-wide, sustainable design and responsible sourcing 
practices. In addition, these groups offer us the diverse points of view that test 
and up-level our thinking.

Responsible sourcing is an important focus within our indirect supplier program.

Among our indirect suppliers, our Responsible Sourcing program monitors our 
designated top strategic suppliers through quarterly scorecards that are inte-
grated into their business dashboards, and through regular review with Microsoft 
category sourcing managers. The Responsible Sourcing program also includes 
onsite compliance assessments of outsourced customer service and support call 
centers. In FY16, we completed 65 such onsite assessments.

To advance transparency, we also require our Tier 1 contract hardware manufac-
turers and operators of customer service and support call centers to issue their 
own public corporate social responsibility reports based on the requirements in 
the Global Reporting Initiative.

We’ve pioneered a new approach in the U.S. to set standards for suppliers to 
provide employees with paid time off.

As a special initiative, in FY16 we began integrating our new procurement stan-
dards into the contract renewal process to ensure that our suppliers in the U.S. 
provide their employees who handle our work with at least 15 days of paid leave 
each year. We believe we were the first large company to take this approach, and 
we gained significant attention for the move from the media, policymakers, and 
other companies. We are working to be thoughtful to ensure that these changes 
don’t undermine the breadth and diversity of our suppliers.

Capacity building

While our auditing and assessment efforts provide insight to risks and act as as-
surance mechanisms, they are only effective for a point in time unless we are able 
to build long-term expertise and systems. This long-term view toward factory 
sustainability is exemplified through model factories and other purpose-driven 
programs.

We focus on building supplier capabilities through training and sharing experi-
ences and best practices. Explore examples in the sections below.

Environmental, health, and safety (EHS) capability building

Factory worker health and safety is a top priority for Microsoft. Over the past four 
years, we have significantly expanded our engagements to help directly contract-
ed hardware suppliers create and maintain safe working environments:

• Microsoft’s SEA team has designed 42 EHS training courses and provided onsite 
consultation to help build suppliers’ capabilities.

Chemical Management Program

The Process Chemical Management Program restricts and drives the phase-out 
of certain chemicals from the manufacturing processes of our directly contracted 
hardware suppliers. In FY16, we worked to further evaluate potential impacts to 
the workers and environment by chemicals and substances used in manufac-
turing and disposal, and then expanded our list of banned chemicals. We also 
worked closely with suppliers on systems and approaches that will enable more 
effective management and evaluation of chemical usage.

We will continue to proactively restrict identified and evaluated harmful process 
chemicals, as well as actively support our suppliers in their phase-out process. 
In FY16, we continued to evaluate potential impacts to the workers and environ-
ment by chemicals and substances used in manufacturing and disposal, and then 
expanded the list of banned chemicals. In the meantime, we worked closely with 
suppliers on systems and approaches that will enable more effective manage-
ment and evaluation of chemical usage.

• In FY16, 330 EHS professionals from Microsoft suppliers attended our SEA in-
house training, representing factories with more than 30,000 workers.

Model Factory Scorecard

• We also continued to emphasize the need for competent and experienced EHS 
professionals in the factory to define and implement the programs necessary to 
build a culture of health and safety. To date, we have worked with 37 suppliers on 
gaining certification of safety culture programs.

Safety Culture Program

The Safety Culture project requires suppliers to conduct a self-assessment of 
eight key areas of the safety commitment, including risk control and accident 
prevention, worker participation, and training. Directly contracted hardware sup-
pliers are given two quarters to work on the areas they have identified, and then 
a formal assessment is conducted by the SEA program manager at the supplier 
site. Since the pilot program in FY14, we continued to implement this program 
with 37 suppliers.

For the past three years, we worked closely with all Tier 1 hardware suppliers to 
meet requirements of our Model Factory program. Through the Model Factory 
scorecard, we have seen significant improvements in the suppliers’ performance 
in the critical areas of their sustainability programs. The objective of this scorecard 
is to achieve a higher standard in compliance, living conditions, worker training 
and development, Environment, Health and Safety management, communication, 
and transparency.

Carbon emissions reporting

Microsoft’s Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) report includes emissions associated 
with our direct manufacturing and, at a minimum, 80% of our suppliers by spend. 
For indirect suppliers, we engage the CDP Supply Chain Program to provide our 
suppliers a standardized platform to understand the risks and opportunities that 
climate change presents to them.

Over the last two years, Microsoft has increased its indirect supplier response to 
the CDP Supplier questionnaire nine-fold, from 17 to 153 respondents (Figure A). 
The 153 suppliers that disclosed in 2015 reported $4 billion invested in emissions 
reduction activities, reducing their collective footprint by 5.6 million metric tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and saving them $865 million.

Code of Conduct and ethics training

We provide supplier development and training resources including our Supplier 
Code of Conduct Training Program across our broad base of indirect suppliers. 
This online training is mandatory for external staff to ensure that they understand 
and follow ethical business practices in accordance with our Supplier Code of 
Conduct. In FY16, 49,997 employees at 10,817 suppliers completed this training.

Our conflict minerals tracking efforts are aligned to the Organization for Econom-
ic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Respon-
sible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. 
Microsoft’s full material declarations database for our hardware products enables 
us to identify every component in our current device portfolio containing tin, 
gold, tantalum, or tungsten. We then identify the suppliers of these components 
with the assistance of Sourcing and Manufacturing and educate the suppliers 
regarding the conflict-minerals issue.

Sourcing of raw materials

Microsoft’s Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials policy extends our Supplier 
Code of Conduct to the furthest reaches of our upstream supply chain in support 
of human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental protection, and business 
ethics. This commitment is global in scope and applies to all substances used in 
our devices and packaging, unbounded by materials or geographic origin.

Raw material supply chains are complex due to the multiple levels of processing 
and the diverse usages across different industries. Given this complexity, we are 
focusing our efforts to influence social and environmental improvements in the 
extractive industries through strategic collaborations that achieve our goal at 
scale. Microsoft actively works with other companies, global and local non-gov-
ernmental organizations, and industrial associations to support standards-setting, 
align industry-wide and cross-industry efforts, and exchange best practices.

Examples of our collaboration and capability building efforts include Microsoft’s 
support and participation in the work of several industry and NGO organizations 
directly related to our upstream supply chain, such as Pact and the Initiative for 
Responsible Mining and Alliance for Responsible Mining, which are listed among 
the groups we collaborated with in FY16 in our document listing partnerships with 
NGOs and industry groups. 

Conflict minerals

We have collaborated with our suppliers and other hardware companies since 
2007 to address conflict minerals.

As directed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) requires registrants whose products contain certain “conflict minerals” 
(tungsten, tin, tantalum, or gold, referred to as “3TG”) to report annually whether 
those minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an 
adjoining country. The act seeks to remove one of the main motives for armed 
conflict in this region—control of lucrative mines.

Microsoft has published a Conflict Minerals Report annually since 2014. Our latest 
Conflict Minerals Report, published in May 2016, demonstrates meaningful efforts 
and progress toward establishing a “conflict-free” supply chain. The number of 
certified conflict-free smelters in our supply chain increased from 148 to 213, due 
to enhanced supplier outreach and the maturation of the Conflict Free Smelter 
Program (CFSP), of which we were an original participant and remain a strong 
supporter.

Creating shared value

We seek to collaborate with our supply chain on partnerships that benefit Micro-
soft, our suppliers, and those who work for them. We also actively seek ways to 
improve the lives of the people and communities who help to further our work.

Microsoft has a long-standing and strong commitment to source from historically 
disadvantaged groups.

Our Procurement team is committed to increasing our spending with diverse sup-
pliers as part of our Supplier Diversity Program. We also have focused programs 
in place to encourage diversity among the law firms we do business with and to 
increase the diversity of banks and financial institutions we use.

We invest in worker and community learning opportunities to improve the lives of 
people in our supply chain.

Among the ways we are helping to advance the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals is leveraging our supplier relationships to promote greater access to educa-
tion and technology skills.

Through the Microsoft YouthSpark Supplier Community Technology Center (CTC) 
program, we collaborate with suppliers to further extend the reach of Microsoft’s 
YouthSpark initiative. We provide curriculum and support to help our suppliers 
use their facilities to host technology skills trainings for their employees and to 
local community members. These trainings provide participants an opportunity to 
receive a no-cost Microsoft Digital Literacy certificate, a key qualification for many 
technology jobs. To date, 16 suppliers have launched centers at 26 locations in 14 
countries and trained 60,000 participants to achieve a Microsoft Digital Literacy 
Certificate.

We have also worked closely with our Tier 1 hardware factories to ensure workers 
have access to a broad range of onsite and online career development and life 
skills classes. Over the past two years, 214,574 workers had participated in these 
training programs. These include the HER Women Health project, Migrant Parent-
ing training, and YouthSpark computer training.

We are committed to helping suppliers hire and train disadvantaged workers.

This practice is called impact sourcing. In FY16 we continued our collaboration 
with the Rockefeller Foundation to research and promote best practices in impact 
sourcing” with suppliers who proactively seek to provide work and training op-
portunities to high-potential but disadvantaged individuals.

Here are some examples of how we’re addressing this challenge:

• The corporate Customer Service and Support group is integrating impact sourc-
ing with their strategic, multinational contact center suppliers, which is impacting 
thousands of disadvantaged workers.

• Our Real Estate and Facility organization works with neurologically and physical-
ly disadvantaged workers in their supported employability program.

• Some of our software groups are engaging neurologically and physically disad-
vantaged workers to perform application testing services.

• Finally, we continue to build more inclusive and productive supply chains be-
yond Microsoft by participating in over 20 Rockefeller sponsored business cases, 
publications, and conferences. This includes participating in the founding of the 
Global Impact Sourcing Coalition (GISC) to promote best practices in impact 
sourcing.

We encourage and recognize suppliers who have made exceptional impact in 
social and environmental areas.

One way we do this is through our supplier awards program for indirect suppliers. 
These are highlighted as examples to attendees of our annual supplier summit. 
In 2016, these included a Supplier Diversity Award, Impact Sourcing Leadership 
Award, and Climate Performance Leadership Award.

In FY16, Microsoft supported impact sourcing projects in 11 countries including the United States, Kenya, 
Uganda, and India for services such as back-office work and facilities management.

Our approach

Our leadership is focused on bringing out the 
best in people, so that everyone brings their “A” 
game and finds deep meaning in their work.

Perhaps the most important driver of our success is culture. We fundamentally 
believe that we need a culture founded in a growth mindset. It starts with the 
beliefs that:

• Everyone can grow and develop.

We are committed to respecting the human rights of all

Through Microsoft’s Global Human Rights Statement and as a signatory to the 
UN Global Compact, we’re committed to respecting the following human rights 
covenants and declarations:

• Potential is nurtured, not predetermined.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

• Anyone can change their mindset.

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 

We strive to exercise our growth mindset every day by being:

Customer-obsessed

We learn about our customers and their businesses with a beginner’s mind and 
then bring solutions that meet their needs. We look to learn from the outside and 
bring that knowledge into Microsoft, while still innovating to surprise and delight 
our customers.

Diverse and inclusive

The world is diverse. We serve everyone on the planet by representing everyone 
on the planet. We seek to be open to learning our own biases and changing our 
behaviors so we can tap into the collective power of everyone at Microsoft. We 
don’t just value differences, we seek them out and invite them in. And as a result, 
our ideas are better, our products are better and our customers are better served.

One Microsoft

We are a family of individuals united by a single, shared mission. We build on the 
ideas of others and collaborate across boundaries to bring the best of Microsoft 
to our customers.

respect of employment and occupation.

In addition, our Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct incorporates the follow-
ing commitments to:

• Communicate respectfully with each other.

• Provide for diversity and equal employment opportunity at all levels of our 
organization.

• Protect the safety and health of our employees.

Microsoft’s global Human Resources (HR) team advances our policies and

the world by a third-party vendor to protect employee anonymity. In FY15, nearly 
85 percent of our more than 117,000 employees responded.

The poll asks employees to share feedback about their experience working at Mi-
crosoft, Microsoft’s Senior Leadership Team, and our culture. Individual managers 
use the poll results to further improve on areas of strength and address opportu-
nities for improvement. We supplement the poll with additional quarterly “pulse”

Workforce diversity

Our emphasis on diversity is not purely a conversation about the numbers—it is 
as much a focus on our attitudes and behaviors as leaders that drive the num-
bers. That being said, it is important that we track and report on our diversity 
data, Through our Global Diversity and Inclusion website, we provide detailed 
breakdowns of our workforce diversity in tech and non-tech positions and the 
EEO-1 data we report each year to the US government.

We realize there is still hard work ahead to make our commitment and focus on 
diversity and inclusion a truly integrated part of the company’s standard business 
practices. We are inspired by the opportunities that lie before us and believe that 
the diversity of our workforce and inclusiveness of our culture will continue to 
play a critical role in helping us deliver innovations that will bring ultimate value 
to our customers.

For more on our strategy, visit our Global Diversity and Inclusion website.

Compensation and benefits

Our Performance and Development program applies to Microsoft employees 
globally at every level of the organization to the extent permitted by local law. 
Stock-based compensation is a key component of our rewards programs at Mic-
rosoft, as it provides an ownership stake in the company’s success. Over 85 per-
cent of Microsoft employees are eligible for an annual stock award. In addition, 
90 percent of Microsoft’s employees are eligible for a cash bonus. Bonuses focus 
on an individual’s business impact over the past year.

Due to local law, local conditions, and employee preferences, some benefits vary 
by location, but we offer a wide assortment of flexible benefits.

Workforce diversity and inclusion

For more than two decades, our Global Diversity and Inclusion Office has evolved 
and enhanced the company’s diversity and inclusion initiatives so that we can 
continue to meet the changing needs of our workforce and business. We are 
deeply committed to creating an inclusive environment where all employees can 
do their best work.

Our commitment is based on:

Strengthening our diversity and inclusion acumen.

Deepening leader and manager understanding of our diversity strategy and its 
value proposition.

Increasing senior leader accountability for their diversity plans.

We know that Microsoft, like the rest of the tech industry, must do more to fully 
reflect the diversity of the global population. As a result, this past fiscal year, we’ve 
put renewed focus and thought into advancing the diversity and inclusion agenda 
within the company. We developed and rolled out key priorities, resulting in our 
FY16 Global Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, which was reviewed and approved 
by our Board of Directors.

Employee wellness and occupational 
health and safety

Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being with compre-
hensive benefits to help employees maximize their physical, financial, and social 
wellness, including:

• The Microsoft Ergonomics Program, offering employees ergonomic assessment 
and training programs and special furniture, equipment, and software for medical 
needs.

• The Microsoft CARES employee assistance program, offering free access to ser-
vices including personal and family counseling, stress management, and referrals 
for child/elder care.

• Fitness benefits that fund gym memberships or fitness-related equipment and 
activities and onsite recreational and fitness opportunities.

• Free onsite “Know Your Numbers” health screening events, providing employ-
ees and their adult dependents with screening for risks of heart disease, diabe-
tes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure as well as onsite mammography 
screenings.

• Healthy dining options, including a new Real Easy Wellness labeling system 
used in all Microsoft cafes with color coding to flag healthier and less healthy 
options.

• Access for Microsoft employees and their dependents to weight management, 
tobacco cessation, and chronic disease management programs.

• An onsite health clinic at our Redmond, Washington headquarters campus, 
offering comprehensive health and wellness services and clinics at some other 
locations.

In addition to our wellness programs, Microsoft’s Health and Safety program 
integrates appropriate safety and health practices into our operations, and works 
for continual improvement in employee health and safety. As part of this com-
mitment, health and safety professionals assess the safety risks of Microsoft work 
activities and engage with workers and management to implement safe work 
practices, hazard controls, and training to minimize safety risks. They also assess 
new workspaces as they are constructed and existing workspaces periodically to 
ensure sound design-for-safety principles are followed and needed controls are 
implemented effectively. As part of this approach, Microsoft involves employees 
and managers in Health and Safety Committees specific to our datacenters, retail 
operations, and our manufacturing facilities.

Over the past several years, we have worked to enhance our capacities to protect 
employee health and safety as the diversity of our operations has grown and 
exposed our employees to new types of workplaces. In FY16, our manufactur-
ing facilities had an injury-incident rate of 0.14 and a lost-day rate of 0.11 (our 
12-month rolling average for July 1, 2015—June 30, 2016 based on US OSHA rules

There are no limits to what people can achieve 
when technology reflects the diversity of every-
one who uses it.

Our commitment

Microsoft is committed to ensuring that our products and services are designed 
for everyone.

In fact, we’ve found that many of our accessibility-focused innovations and fea-
tures allow us to deliver richer and more flexible user experiences for a consider-
ably wider range of people, not just those with disabilities.

We’ve established three guiding principles to lead the way on our accessibility 
journey:

• Transparency: We are open with our plans to ensure our products are accessi-
ble.

• Accountability: We will, going forward, prioritize inclusive design and accessi-
bility in the development of all products and services upstream in the process.

• Inclusivity: We want everyone to be empowered—not only through our prod-
ucts, services, and technology, but within our culture at Microsoft.

Accessible products and inclusive 
design

The Microsoft Accessibility Standards are a company-wide policy that drives con-
sideration for accessibility into every stage of production, including:

• Design

• Development

• Evaluation

• Release

Windows, Office, Microsoft Edge, Xbox, and our other products and services 
include accessibility features and controls such as the Ease of Access Center in 
Windows or the Accessibility Checker in Office.

Accessibility and inclusivity are part of our design process—from the very begin-
ning. Our approach to inclusive Design enables our product managers, engineers, 
and designers to partner with individuals who have a range of abilities across 
visual, hearing, speech, mobility and cognitive spectrum, and we share our learn-
ings broadly so that other companies can benefit from them as well.

We also work to raise the awareness of accessibility issues in the technology 
industry. The Microsoft Accessibility Developer Center provides guidance, tools, 
and technologies for developing accessible applications and web content.

We also seek to provide tools and guides that help governments, schools, and 
businesses to integrate technology for individuals with disabilities. For instance, 
Microsoft is a signatory to the Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and 
Communications Technology (G3ict) Charter, which encourages governments to 
increase digital inclusion for citizens by incorporating accessibility criteria into 
their procurement policies.

To encourage governments to consider accessibility in their purchasing, we pro-

Inclusive hiring isn’t optional or a “nice to do”—it’s vital to deliver on our strategy 
of having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture, which in turn will help us to 
ensure that our products and services empower all of our customers.

Guiding principles and policies

Microsoft envisions a world in which technology can help enable people and 
organizations to accelerate innovation in and deployment of clean energy tech-
nologies, achieve more sustainable economic growth, and drive a transformation 
toward smarter use of resources. Microsoft is committed to taking responsibility 
for and mitigating our impact on the environment.

Microsoft has made important progress on sustainability as a company since 
the start of this decade. We have operated carbon neutral across the company, 
including our datacenters, since 2012. We are committed to accelerating the 
transition to a clean energy infrastructure. To that end, last year we purchased 
more than 3.2 billion kilowatt hours of zero-carbon power and worked with our 
utilities and suppliers to improve the access and affordability of renewable energy. 
We also look for ways to increase energy efficiency across our facilities and our 
supply chain.

But we know that there’s much more work to do to address climate change and 
advance sustainability, as the datacenter industry is an increasingly large consum-
er of natural resources.

Learn more about our datacenter energy usage

Today, large operators like Microsoft consume as much energy as small states, 
and by the middle of the next decade, they will rank among the largest users of 
electrical power on the planet. From FY15 to FY16, in North and South America 
combined, our datacenter energy consumption grew from 1,900,000 MWh to 
2,400,000 MWh; in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, our datacenter consumption 
grew from 450,000 MWh to 600,000 MWh; and in Asia Pacific, our datacenter 
consumption grew from 200,000 MWh to 300,000 MWh. To minimize the impact 
of our growth on the climate, we have therefore increased our commitment to 
make our energy mix less carbon-intensive.

We believe in building a responsible cloud. For Microsoft, this means moving 
beyond datacenters that are already 100 percent carbon neutral to also having 
those data centers rely on a larger percentage of wind, solar, and hydro power 
electricity over time. Today, roughly 44 percent of the electricity used by our da-
tacenters comes from these sources. Our goal is to pass the 50 percent milestone 
by the end of 2018, to top 60 percent early in the next decade, and then to keep 
improving even further from there. We’re committed to continuous improvement 
on an ongoing basis.

Microsoft has been carbon neutral since June of 2012, and we’re committed 
to lean, green, and accountable business practices. We have implemented an 
internal carbon fee, which puts a price on carbon. The fees we collect are used 
to improve energy efficiency, increase our purchase of renewable energy, and 
fund community projects that offset carbon and advance sustainable develop-
ment around the world. Microsoft has also invested in programs that reduce 
environmental impact across its worldwide business operations, from facilities to 
commuting to recycling our food waste.

Microsoft’s manufacturing is certified to the International Organization for Stan-
dardization (ISO) 14001 Environmental Management System. This includes our 
European Operations Center, all Microsoft-owned manufacturing sites, and all the

Microsoft is committed to remaining carbon 
neutral and to increasing our energy efficiency 
and use of renewable energy.

Carbon neutrality

Since July 1, 2012, Microsoft’s global operations have been carbon neutral.
Our commitment to carbon neutrality spans operations in more than 100 coun-
tries. To deliver on our commitment, we created a program to ensure compa-
ny-wide accountability for carbon, charging an internal carbon fee to our busi-
ness groups for the cost of reducing the carbon emissions associated with their 
energy use and air travel. Funds collected from the business groups help support:

• Internal energy efficiency investments.

• Purchases of renewable energy equal to 100 percent of our consumption.

• Externally certified carbon offset projects.

• Support for e-waste recycling and renewable energy innovation.

Since the inception of the carbon fee, Microsoft has:

• Purchased more than 14 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of green power.

• Reduced company-wide emissions by more than 9 million metric tons of car-
bon-dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).

• Supported the lives of more than 7 million people in emerging nations through 
carbon offset community projects.

Our purchase of green energy through this program has earned us recognition 
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a 2016 Climate Lead-
ership award winner, and our work has been recognized by the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a 2015 Lighthouse 
Activity winner in the Momentum for Change initiative.

For the past several years, Microsoft has published white papers that provide an 
update on our progress and impact to date. This year, we are evolving our pro-
gram to go “beyond carbon neutral” and promote local and global good. We are 
focusing on developing new renewable energy projects, supporting sustainable 
development through community projects, advancing energy and efficiency inno-
vation through Climate Grants, and expanding our reporting to better measure 
our impact.

Carbon footprint

Transparency is important to our customers, investors, and partners. Microsoft 
has a longstanding history of disclosing our carbon footprint, and we have 
reported voluntarily on our carbon emissions through CDP (formerly the Carbon 
Disclosure Project) since 2005. Data on our carbon emissions are available on the 
CDP website.

Microsoft can have even more impact by influencing the sustainability of our 
supply chain. Toward that end, we encourage our contracted hardware suppliers 
to report their emissions to CDP and encourage all of our indirect suppliers to 
report as well. In recognition of our climate efforts, CDP has included Microsoft 
on its Climate A List for climate performance leadership for 2013 – 2016.

Renewable energy

We have more than 100 datacenters around the world that are delivering a se-
cure, trusted, and responsible cloud. In May 2016, we announced a commitment 
to increase the percentage of wind, solar, and hydro energy we use to power 
these datacenters.

As of 2016, roughly 44 percent of the electricity used by our datacenters comes 
from wind, solar, and hydropower energy sources. Our goal is to pass the 50 
percent milestone by the end of 2018, and to top 60 percent early in the next 
decade.

In addition to purchasing more clean energy, we are also committed to:

• Maintain carbon neutrality. Through investments in energy efficiency and 
procurement of renewable energy and carbon offsets, we will continue to be 100 
percent carbon neutral in our operations and business air travel.

• Invest in new energy technologies. We will continue to invest in new energy 
technology, such as our biogas and fuel cell work, that has the potential to accel-
erate the availability of different types of energy and drive efficiency.

• Support public policies that help enable new renewable energy sources. We 
will continue to support public policies that accelerate the availability of renew-
able and clean energy in markets where we operate.

• Site our facilities with access to renewable energy. Availability of renewable 
energy is among the criteria that we consider in where to locate our datacenters.

• Retire all green attributes from projects generated from our contracted 
assets: Any time we purchase green energy, we will not sell the renewable energy 
certificates (RECs, or international equivalents) or any other green “attributes” for 
others to claim.

These commitments build on our work to advance renewable energy in our own operations and beyond:

• In November 2015, we reaffirmed our commitment to renewable energy by 
joining RE100, a collaborative initiative of influential businesses committed to 
purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity.

• In FY15 we purchased more than 3.2 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of re-
newable energy, and in January 2015 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
ranked us as the second-largest user of green power in the United States.

• In December 2015, we supported the global negotiations which led to the Paris 
climate agreement, through our participation in the American Business Act on 
Climate initiative and our long-term climate pledge.

• We have purchased electricity from projects that reduce our datacenters’ reli-
ance on fossil fuels, including the 175-MW Pilot Hill Wind Project in Illinois, which 
came online in FY16, and the 110-MW Keechi Wind Farm project in Texas, which 
has operated since FY15.

• In March 2016, we announced a unique public-private partnership between 
Microsoft, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Dominion Virginia Power to bring 
20 MW of new solar energy onto the grid in Virginia.

• In April 2016, we joined Amazon, Apple, and Google in filing an amicus brief 
that supports the implementation of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and its goal of 
expanding clean energy in the U.S. electricity sector.

Microsoft’s latest wind deal marks progress towards our goal and unlocks new innovations.

Our investment in new energy technologies drives new efficiencies in datacenters.

Compared to conventional chiller solutions, the air cooling techniques we employ 
at our datacenters result in 20-30 percent lower energy consumption and 90 per-
cent lower water consumption. Our broader energy efficiency strategy is focused 
on changes that we can make in the future that will have even greater gains:

• We are experimenting with ways to integrate fuel cells into our datacenters to 
improve efficiencies and reduce transmission losses.

• We are working with industry partners and the U.S. Department of Energy to 
pilot and commercialize new energy technologies that we hope will be foun-
dational to the next generation of efficient datacenter designs. This includes 
our multi-year partnership with the University of Texas at San Antonio and the 
school’s Texas Sustainable Energy Research Institute to identify economically via-
ble technologies that reduce the environmental footprint of datacenters.

• We contributed new, innovative hardware specifications to the Open Compute 
Project, which is focused on engineering the most efficient hardware for cloud 
and high-scale computing via open collaboration.

Energy efficiency in buildings: We invest to reduce carbon and save energy.

Through our carbon program, we have invested over $3.1 million in our real 
estate facility projects that reduced our associated carbon emissions by over 
18,000 metric tons and saved over $3.6 million in annual energy costs – paying 
for themselves in under a year.

With one of our partners, Iconics, Microsoft leveraged our corporate campus to 
help create an analytical software solution that prioritizes maintenance and re-
pairs our 125 Puget Sound buildings based on energy and cost savings potential. 
Generating energy savings of 10–11 percent, the Puget Sound system paid for 
itself in less than two years, and we’ve now also implemented the solution on our 
Silicon Valley and Las Colinas campuses, with additional deployments on other 
campuses underway.

We are sharing our results with government and industry leaders from around 
the globe and making similar solutions available through partners to our custom-
ers (such as through Microsoft CityNext offerings).

Waste management

We seek to be responsible stewards of water 
resources, and to minimize the impact of our 
waste.

Microsoft is focused on responsible water stewardship in our office buildings, 
datacenters and manufacturing sites. We report on our water use, risk, and gov-
ernance annually through CDP.

Microsoft uses outside ambient air to cool most of its datacenters for the majority 
of the year, and during hot summer months we inject water into the airstream as 
supplemental cooling to take advantage of evaporation. Compared to conven-
tional chiller solutions, the air cooling techniques we employ at our datacenters 
result in 20-30 percent lower energy consumption and 90 percent lower water 
consumption. We also recently completed a research project to determine the 
feasibility of a subsea datacenter, which uses ocean water to cool the facility.

Beyond datacenters, Microsoft continues to invest in water-saving fixtures in our 
office buildings and smart landscape irrigation practices that conserve water. In 
India, we capture rainwater for irrigation, and on our Hyderabad campus, we treat 
sewage for use in landscaping, resulting in zero sewer discharge. Our Paris office 
also uses captured rainwater for irrigation and flush fixtures.

Microsoft Real Estate and Facilities teams around the world implement waste min-
imization programs, including office supply reuse, recycling, and in many cases, 
composting. Our Redmond, Washington dining facilities divert 99 percent of the 
waste from the landfill by recycling, using compostable tableware, and adapting 
our menu to minimize food waste.

We’ve also achieved a goal of zero waste from our global headquarters facili-
ties in Puget Sound, Washington, which currently represents approximately 45 
percent of our total real estate portfolio. Consistent with zero waste certification, 
we divert 90 percent of our Puget Sound campus waste from landfills, and we are 
working to increase that number and extend that goal to additional campuses in 
the U.S. and around the globe. We also continue to work on reducing the amount 
of waste that we generate in the first place.

In addition to promoting recycling of our products worldwide, we have a zero 
landfill policy for the electronic waste (e-waste) that our internal operations gen-
erate. The Microsoft IT Asset Disposition Program (ITAD) supports the recycling 
and reuse of e-waste, helping reduce life-cycle energy consumption and green-
house gas emissions, and minimizing hazardous waste. In FY15, this program 
avoided over 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e); in FY16, 
the program expanded to cover 70 countries.

When we do generate waste, we recycle whenever possible, and dispose of any 
remainder as required by local regulations. We have also developed an auditing 
program to verify that any facility that handles our waste for recycling or disposal 
does so responsibly, in compliance with environmental regulations.

Through our products and our collaboration 
with others, we seek to help the world tackle 
pressing environmental challenges.

Sustainable devices

At Microsoft, we think every product should be made with the environment in 
mind, from initial design to use to end of life.

See how we:

• Incorporate sustainability into product design.

• Incorporate sustainability into materials selection.

• Promote energy efficiency in our products.

• Reduce impacts from packaging.

• Seek to keep products and their components out of landfills at the end of their 
life cycle by recycling them.

Devices ranging from appliances and fixtures to equipment, vehicles, and 
charging stations generate massive amounts of information on resource use, 
dramatically expanding opportunities for data-driven sustainability. This data 
represents a significant opportunity to make more accurate decisions, achieve 
greater efficiencies, and become more sustainable in areas like energy, water, 
buildings, and transportation. Microsoft is investing to help customers manage 
resources more effectively using big data through tools for Windows Server and 
Windows Azure.

For example, to increase the use of renewable energy, data can help grid opera-
tors understand and anticipate energy demand, production capabilities of renew-
able and non-renewable energy sources, and consumption in almost real time. 
By better balancing these resources, utilities can enable more responsive energy 
generation. Microsoft recently partnered with Agder Energi on a pilot project 
using technology to make energy distribution more responsive, and manage both 
end uses and renewable sources more effectively.

Enabling digital transformation through 
our products and services

We seek to provide products and services that create solutions for environmental 
challenges.

Cloud services

Microsoft Cloud and Azure offer organizations energy-efficient alternatives to 
running their own private datacenters. One study found that moving to Microsoft 
cloud services for Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Dynamics CRM capabili-
ties can help businesses reduce energy use by 30 to 90 percent per user com-
pared to running on-premises. With Microsoft Azure, businesses can use Micro-
soft’s carbon-neutral datacenters for on-demand computing and storage, helping 
save energy costs and reduce carbon emissions while also reducing capital costs 
associated with purchasing hardware and infrastructure.

Microsoft CityNext partners provide solutions spanning buildings, energy, and 
transportation to help make cities more sustainable by minimizing their resource 
use and environmental impact.

Microsoft and its partners deliver these solutions for urban sustainability through:

Buildings, infrastructure, and planning: Microsoft partners are delivering cloud-
based solutions that lower building energy consumption and improve the per-
formance of buildings. By using cloud-based analytics and business intelligence 
capabilities, buildings can be smarter and more efficient and save 10-20 percent 
of energy costs per year.

Energy: Microsoft partners use digital technology to integrate and manage dis-
tributed energy supply and demand data, improving the reliability, security, and 
efficiency of the electric system.

Transportation: Microsoft partners are helping to improve the design and op-
eration of transport networks and run real-time data systems that can facilitate 
cleaner and more efficient transport choices.

Over 150 CityNext partners are delivering more than 360 sustainability solutions 
in countries around the world.

Partnerships

Microsoft partners with governments, policymakers, and NGOs around the world 
to address key environmental issues that affect our business, employees, and the 
communities we serve.

Microsoft’s Climate Change Policy Statement recognizes that climate change is 
“a serious challenge that requires a comprehensive and global response from all 
sectors of society.” Microsoft is working to advance public policies that promote 
the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to advance energy 
efficiency, spur innovation and economic opportunity, and contribute to practical 
strategies for mitigating climate change.

For the past six years, our annual Global Public Policy Agenda has included a sec-
tion with supporting government policies that promote technological advances 
and innovation to reduce energy use and limit the effects of climate change. In 
October 2016, we reaffirmed this commitment with the launch of a cloud policy 
roadmap that seeks to maximize the opportunities and minimize the challenges 
that cloud computing brings. This roadmap covers fifteen policy areas to harness 
the social and economic benefits of cloud computing to benefit everyone. It also 
identifies how a global cloud infrastructure provides an important opportunity 
to accelerate the development of renewable energy, to develop and deploy new 
clean energy technologies, and to drive further improvements in energy efficien-
cy.

We have also supported industry and multi-stakeholder initiatives to address 
climate policy. Among these:

• Microsoft sits on the board of Advanced Energy Economy and organizations 
focused on making energy secure, clean, and affordable.

• We are a signatory to the Climate Declaration, a nonpartisan statement from 
the business community developed by Ceres and its Business for Innovative Cli-
mate & Energy Policy (BICEP) coalition, which has declared that “tackling climate 
change is one of America’s greatest economic opportunities of the 21st century.”

• We are a founding member of the Digital Energy & Sustainability Solutions 
Campaign (DESSC), a coalition of leading ICT companies and environmental 
NGOs. DESSC is committed to advancing public policies that help drive sustain-
able economic growth through ICT-enabled energy efficiency and clean energy 
innovation.

• We serve on the board of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), a collabo-
rative effort between leading IT companies and the United Nations Environment 
Programme and International Telecommunication Union.

• We participate in the RE100, a collaborative, global initiative of influential 
organizations committed to 100% renewable electricity, and we have been 100% 
powered by renewable energy since 2014. In 2016, we signed an amicus brief with 
other technology companies in support of the Clean Power Plan and its goal of 
expanding clean energy in the U.S. electricity sector.

• We work with Rockefeller’s 100 Resilient Cities, which helps cities around the 
world address 21st-century physical, social, and economic challenges.

• In September 2016, we became a founding member of the White House Part-
nership for Resilience and Preparedness, a public-private group focused on using 
data to build climate resiliency.

• In September 2016, we joined over 500 countries, cities, and companies to call 
for an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase out hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), a powerful pollutant.

Through Microsoft Research and groups that we sponsor, we are also working to 
apply information technology to address large-scale environmental challenges. 
Microsoft Research’s Earth, Energy, and Environment collaboration focuses on the 
development and adoption of technologies for scientific visualization and data 
management—especially technologies that accelerate insight into environmental 
and earth sciences.

Microsoft and the UN Sustainable Development Goals

In September 2015, the UN General Assembly agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to reach 
by 2030. The goals and specific targets under the goals seek to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure pros-
perity for all.

Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more aligns strong-
ly to the UN SDGs. To better understand how we and other information technology companies can advance the 
goals, Microsoft was a lead sponsor of a report by the Global E-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and Accenture called 
“#SystemTransformation.” The report found that digital technology can help put all the SDGs within reach by en-
abling a broad range of economic and social opportunities worldwide.

In September 2016 we produced a white paper to identify ways in which Microsoft contributes to the global effort 
to achieve the SDGs. (Read the report here.)
