Ready for what’s

A Message From Our CEO

This is an extraordinary time for our company and our country as we 
respond to the impact of COVID-19. This pandemic is unlike anything 
we’ve seen – and it’s required us to dramatically adjust how we operate. 
Like people everywhere, we’ve experienced a range of emotions – 
everything from fear and anxiety to hope and pride – as we navigate 
this together. 

Having a mission, vision and values keeps us grounded in an uncertain 
time. Our purpose at Duke Energy has never been more important. We 
provide an essential service. We power the daily lives of our employees, 
customers and communities, no matter the circumstances. And 
sustainability is a critical part of that.  

The importance of delivering value through sustainability continues 
to grow, reshaping how industries operate, invest and deliver value to 
their stakeholders.

I’m proud to say we have a strong track record on sustainability, 
including the actions we’ve taken to reduce the impact of our operations 
on the environment. For example, last year we decreased our carbon 
emissions an additional 8 percent from 2005 levels, bringing total 
reductions to 39 percent.  

That’s progress – but we’ve taken our commitment even further. 

In 2019, we refreshed our climate strategy and accelerated our goals – 
we now plan to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation by 
at least 50 percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. 
In the pages that follow and our newly released Climate Report, you’ll 
find more details on how we plan to achieve these targets. We’re also 
strong advocates for investments in research and development and 
technologies that don’t exist at scale yet today.

THE IMPORTANCE OF DELIVERING VALUE THROUGH 
SUSTAINABILITY CONTINUES TO GROW, RESHAPING HOW 
INDUSTRIES OPERATE, INVEST AND DELIVER VALUE TO 
THEIR STAKEHOLDERS.

2019 Results

Other highlights of our sustainability success in 
2019 include: 

 ■ Shared our plans to pursue subsequent license 
renewal to operate our nuclear fleet for another 
20 years. Nuclear power is a linchpin in achieving 
our climate goals – providing nearly 90 percent of our 
carbon-free generation. 

 ■ Announced over 1,500 megawatts of new wind 

and solar projects in our Commercial Renewables 
business, and made significant progress on new solar 
projects in our regulated businesses in Florida and 
the Carolinas.

 ■ Brought our Asheville combined-cycle natural gas 

plant online in North Carolina and have since retired 
two coal-fired units at the site. 

 ■ Improved reliability measures 15 percent year over 
year and prevented more than 610,000 extended 
power outages, saving customers approximately 
62 million outage minutes with self-optimizing 
grid capabilities. 

 ■ Issued an additional $1.3 billion in green bonds, 

bringing our total clean energy offerings to 
$2.3 billion since 2018. 

 ■ Announced plans to support the deployment of 

nearly 7,500 electric vehicle chargers in our service 
territories including residential, fleet, public transit 
and highway fast charging. 

 ■ Increased investment in battery storage, including 
approximately $600 million over the next five 
to 10 years to expand capabilities by nearly 
400 megawatts. 

 ■ Continued to build a diverse and talented workforce 
that’s positioned to meet the pace of change in our 
industry. This includes the establishment of our 
Optimist Hall facility with nearly 400 employees 
dedicated to developing new products and services 
and transforming how we operate our business. 

 ■ Remained active in the communities we serve, 
creating jobs, fostering innovation and providing 
support. In 2019, we helped attract over 15,000 
jobs and $7.1 billion across our service territories. 

 ■ Donated more than $30 million in 2019 to help 

tackle pressing community issues, such as the opioid 
epidemic, access to affordable housing and skilling 
the workforce for the jobs of tomorrow. 

Continuing Our Legacy

In a time when uncertainty is the only certainty, it 
reminds us to stay focused on the path forward.  

We’re embracing change as we prepare our business 
to meet tomorrow’s energy needs. We’re becoming 
more efficient, more competitive and more agile – while 
maintaining our commitment to sustainability.

There’s no question sustainability is a defining 
characteristic of our future, and I look forward 
to continuing our legacy of meeting the needs of 
our stakeholders.

About This Report

The energy industry is changing. At Duke Energy, we want to give our 
customers, employees, and stakeholders a front seat to impact and 
witness this exciting transformation.

In 2019, we announced a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050, 
a key development as we seek to build a cleaner energy future.

Tomorrow’s energy landscape will continue to address key issues of 
today: Ensuring reliable and affordable energy while addressing the 
important issue of climate change. We must also be mindful of a 
changing workforce, economic opportunity for the communities we 
serve, cybersecurity and the role of new technology, and we will need to 
collaborate with our stakeholders to develop solutions to these issues. 

Successful companies are those that recognize and adapt to a 
changing landscape. In this report, you will notice the many areas 
where engagement with our external stakeholders has created 
positive outcomes. 

That engagement will continue as Duke Energy moves toward a more 
clean, affordable and reliable energy system. Maintaining open, two-way 
communication channels will help us promote a better environment for 
sustainability to thrive.

As always, we aim to make sure our information is comprehensive, clear 
and paints an accurate picture of the company. We are proud of the 
progress we’ve made and are focused on opportunities for improvement.

In addition to this Sustainability Report, you can find a detailed 
Global Reporting Initiative Index on our website. Duke Energy is 
also participating in the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas 
Association sustainability reporting initiative. 

The company has also issued a 2020 Climate Report to provide more 
details on how we are managing climate risks, including physical, policy 
and economic risks – as well as our plan to transition to a cleaner 
energy future. The report is organized to align with the Taskforce on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.

Lastly, we intend to use the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB) standards in 2020 to help inform our sustainability reporting. 

Thank you for your interest in the 2019 Sustainability Report and 
Duke Energy.

INTRODUCTIONOur Stakeholders and What Matters Most 

The Value of Our Stakeholders

What Matters Most

Duke Energy is honored to provide the reliable energy 
that keeps our communities moving forward. Every day, 
our product has an impact on people’s lives.

With that privilege comes a deep sense of responsibility 
to deliver the right energy solutions. The only way to get 
those solutions right is if they are shaped by the views 
of a broad array of perspectives. 

Thankfully, our stakeholder audience is diverse. 
They include customers, shareholders, regulators, 
environmental groups, social advocates, community 
agencies, elected officials, employees and many 
others. Each stakeholder brings a needed and essential 
perspective, which is vitally important as we develop 
future energy solutions to meet their needs. 

Getting those perspectives early and often – and 
then collaborating to develop workable solutions – is 
essential. We seek that input in many formal and 
informal ways. They range from one-on-one meetings in 
our stakeholders’ offices to open houses to our Advisory 
or Listening Councils – to name a few. 

With so much at stake, securing and transforming 
our collective energy future depends on hearing many 
voices. Our commitment to make a positive impact on 
our communities keeps us focused on hearing more and 
listening harder.

Duke Energy’s approach to sustainability focuses on 
the issues that are most important to our stakeholders 
and to us. We identify issues from a variety of sources 
such as stakeholder feedback, surveys, reporting 
frameworks, thought leader perspectives, social and 
traditional media coverage, and shareholder proposals 
in our sector.

We have mapped our priority issues to the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which 
aim to “end poverty, protect the planet and ensure 
prosperity for all.” Since their development in 2015, 
the 17 SDGs have gained traction with stakeholders 
concerned about sustainability issues. While there 
was alignment between our priorities and several of 
the SDGs, goals such as “Seven: Affordable and Clean 
Energy,” and “Thirteen: Climate Action,” are especially 
applicable to our company. 

The graphic depicts the relationship among 
Duke Energy, its stakeholders and the most important 
issues. The stakeholders and issues are both presented 
alphabetically to make it clear that they are all 
important while safety, as always, is our No. 1 priority.

Duke Energy’s goals to 
reduce customer energy 
consumption and peak 
demand were both 
exceeded in 2019.

Bethany School’s commitment to 
sustainability resulted in an ultra-
efficient design that earned the school 
more than $75,000 in Duke Energy 
incentives and rebates.

Some of the energy-efficient design 
features include:

 ■ A building layout that keeps most 

classrooms out of the direct path of 
the sun.

 ■ Insulation that keeps warm air inside 
the building during winter or outside 
during summer.

 ■ Roofing materials chosen with high 
solar reflectance values, to minimize 
the “heat island effect” that buildings 
can create in the environment.

 ■ A geothermal exchange system of 

more than 100 piping wells buried to 
depths of 305 feet – and engineered 
to maximize the transfer of warmer 
or cooler air between buildings 
where needed. 

In total, the design is expected to 
deliver energy savings of about 187,000 
kilowatt hours per year. That’s about 
the same amount of energy used to dry 
more than 53,600 loads of laundry and 
good news for a school committed to 
sustainability and saving money.

Early Collaboration Yields 
Savings at Cincinnati School 

Duke Energy has been exceeding its 
energy efficiency goals as customers 
embrace doing more with less energy. 
The company has been recognized as 
the clear leader in energy efficiency in 
the Southeast by the Southern Alliance 
for Clean Energy. 

Duke Energy’s goals to reduce customer 
energy consumption and peak demand 
were both exceeded in 2019. The 
company has set even more aggressive 
energy efficiency goals for 2020. 

Duke Energy works closely with its 
customers to help them save energy 
and money.

A collaboration between Duke Energy 
and the Bethany School in Cincinnati 
helped the kindergarten through eighth 
grade school earn recognition as the 
Midwest’s first “net-zero” school building 
and the second-most energy-efficient 
school in the U.S. 

To earn a net-zero designation, a 
building must be powered by enough 
renewable energy to offset its demand 
for energy produced by carbon-emitting 
sources. The Bethany School earned 
its designation by using two types of 
renewable energy systems: solar and 
geothermal. A solar energy system 
harnesses the sun’s power to produce 
electricity. Geothermal systems draw 
from the Earth’s natural temperature for 
heating and cooling.

Duke Energy is strengthening the electric grid to keep customers’ lights on during severe weather.

Helping Customers Go Green with 
REC Purchases

When label stock maker UPM Raflatac wanted to go 
100 percent renewable, it didn’t have the luxury of 
building a solar or wind farm at its plant in Henderson 
County, North Carolina.

But it did have another option: It could buy the 
ownership rights to the amount of energy its Mill River 
plant and its 170 employees would use in a year.

The path to 100 percent renewable involved buying 
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) through 
Duke Energy’s company REC Solutions. To renewable 
energy insiders, a REC (pronounced “wreck”) is a 
common term. To the rest of the world – not so much.

Currently, a REC can cost anywhere from 75 cents 
to $8 per MWh in Duke Energy’s regulated service 
territories – depending on geography and various 
state regulations. In some areas of the northeastern 
United States, a REC can cost as much as $400.

So as customers seek to meet their sustainability goals, 
buying RECs could be a growing part of that strategy. 
And Duke Energy might be the first energy company 
they call.

Connecting Customers to a Smarter 
Energy Future 

Duke Energy’s grid improvement initiative continues to 
expand across its service territories. 

A REC is a market-based instrument that can be 
bought, sold and traded. One REC is issued when 
1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity is generated and 
delivered to the electricity grid from a renewable energy 
source. It can be from a rooftop solar array, large wind 
farm or several other energy sources.

The company is leveraging smart technologies and 
making strategic investments to improve reliability for 
customers, strengthen the grid against physical and 
cyber threats, enable expansion of solar and innovative 
technologies, and give customers more options and 
control to manage their energy use and save money. 

Many companies cannot change the sources of 
electricity delivered by the local energy grid. But by 
purchasing RECs, those same companies can buy the 
ownership rights to renewable energy. By owning the 
REC, a company can legally claim the renewable energy 
as its own.

As part of this effort, Duke Energy is significantly 
expanding the use of smart, self-healing technology 
that automatically identifies power outages and quickly 
reroutes power to restore customers – often in less than 
a minute – helping to reduce the number of customers 
affected by outages by as much as 75 percent.

Understanding what 
customers think, feel and 
need is essential to being 
nimble and responsive 
in the present, and in 
planning for a smarter 
energy future. 

Customers can track electricity use, report power outages and pay bills using the Duke Energy app.

Self-healing systems delivered significant 
benefits to customers in 2019, helping 
to avoid more than 610,000 extended 
customer outages and saving customers 
more than 1 million hours of outage 
time. And those benefits will continue 
to increase as this technology expands 
in 2020. 

A smart-thinking grid also supports 
the two-way power flow needed to 
effectively integrate rooftop solar and 
other distributed technologies like battery 
storage, electric vehicles and microgrids. 

Duke Energy has delivered improved 
options and control to customers in 2019 
with more than 7 million smart meters 
now installed in the Carolinas, Florida 
and the Midwest  – 80 percent of the 
company’s customers. Smart meters 
provide customers with more information 
about their energy use and usage alerts 
to help them save energy and money 
before their bill arrives. They also provide 
improved outage detection and can 
help to speed restoration following a 
major outage. 

Additional work in 2019 included 
grid-strengthening upgrades, physical 
and cyber security improvements and 
targeted undergrounding of outage-prone 
lines, all of which will help deliver a 
better experience for customers.

With severe weather events increasing 
in frequency and severity across the 
company’s service area, improving 
the grid to make it stronger and more 
resilient will continue to be a top 
priority for Duke Energy to reliably serve 
customers now and in the future.

Transforming the Customer 
Experience Through Action 

At the center of all we do is the 
people we serve – our customers. 
Understanding what customers 
think, feel and need is essential to 
being nimble and responsive in the 
present, and in planning for a smarter 
energy future. 

Duke Energy learns from customers 
through face-to-face conversations 
as well as more formal feedback. 
Surveys, focus groups, town halls and 
other market research are some of the 
information sources we rely on.

19 | 2019 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

Still, what we learn only transforms the customer 
experience when we respond with action. Our 
most recent customer service enhancements were 
developed to meet customer needs for real-time and 
proactive information: 

 ■ The Duke Energy app offers easy access to 
paying an energy bill, tracking home energy 
use, reporting and checking an outage status, 
and more. 

 ■ The interactive outage map provides the number 
of customers without power, when and where an 
outage was reported and estimated restoration 
times. Customers can also opt in to receive 
outage alerts by phone, text or email.

 ■ Track My Service notifications provide updates to 
customers seeking to start, stop or transfer their 
energy services, and are expanding to include 
planned outage and vegetation management (tree 
trimming) notifications. 

These tools complement Duke Energy’s existing 
service offerings including My Home Energy Report, 
Online Savings Store, the Find It Duke contractor 
referral service and the Free Home Energy 
House Call. 

Connecting with customers in the ways that matter 
most helped increase Duke Energy’s internal 
customer satisfaction rating by 25 percent in 
2019. The company also saw improvement across 
most of our service territories as measured by 
J.D. Power’s Customer Service Index for residential 
service customers.

Looking ahead, customers can expect more action 
in response to their feedback. A newly designed 
energy bill, based on input from customers, is just 
one example. In the meantime, we’ll keep listening 
and learning in order to further deliver on customer 
wants and needs.

Warmth’s inception 
in 1985, Duke Energy 
has contributed more 
than $35 million to 
the program through 
Crisis Assistance 
Ministry and 85 other 
service agencies.

Customer Assistance 
Programs Help Those in Need 

Helping customers in need with heating 
and cooling assistance programs has 
been a hallmark of Duke Energy for 
a generation. The company’s heating 
assistance programs include Share the 
Warmth in the Carolinas, Helping Hand 
Indiana, HeatShare Ohio and WinterCare 
Kentucky. To help with energy costs 
during extreme summer heat, the 
company offers Cooling Assistance in 
the Carolinas and the Energy Neighbor 
Fund in both the Carolinas and Florida. 

Since Share the Warmth’s inception in 
1985, Duke Energy has contributed 
more than $35 million to the program 
through Crisis Assistance Ministry 
and 85 other service agencies. The 
program is supported by Duke Energy’s 
customers, shareholders and employees. 
The Duke Energy Foundation matches 
all contributions dollar for dollar up 
to $500,000. 

The Piedmont Natural Gas Share the 
Warmth program has contributed 
more than $3.7 million in customer 
and corporate donations since 2003 
to Crisis Assistance Ministry and other 
organizations to help struggling residents 
in North Carolina, South Carolina 
and Tennessee.

Piedmont’s optional program rounds 
a customer’s monthly bill up to the 
nearest dollar – totaling no more than 
$12 a year – and donates the difference 
to help those in need in the community, 
regardless of their energy source 
or provider.

These contributions are invaluable to 
those struggling to make ends meet, 
giving them the means to keep their 
heat on and families warm.

The company is always looking for new 
ways to help more customers in need. 
In December 2019, Duke Energy and 
the NFL’s Carolina Panthers teamed 
up to bolster contributions to Share 
the Warmth. 

The partnership included game-day 
events, advertising and other outreach 
efforts including a text-to-give option 
allowing anyone who donates to receive 
an exclusive thank-you video featuring 
Carolina Panther players. 

Plus, the Carolina Panthers Charities 
Fund contributed $1,000 per 
quarterback sack in December and 
guaranteed a minimum of $15,000 – 
the grand total was $15,000.

Investing In Our Communities 

Duke Energy has a long history of 
supporting its communities. In 2019, 
the Duke Energy Foundation contributed 
$31.1 million in its territories – from 
nonprofits to major issues that impact 
our areas.

In 2019, the company made $750,000 
in grants to tackle a major problem 
facing the nation: opioid addiction.

In North Carolina, the company 
awarded $100,000 to the More

services for people impacted by drug use. NCHRC also 
provides resources and support to the law enforcement, 
public health and provider communities.

In Indiana, Duke Energy announced $250,000 in 
grants to tackle unique aspects of the issue. Five 
people a day die in the state from drug overdoses – 
many opioid related.

Ivy Tech Community College will receive $175,000 to 
educate and prepare specialists in addiction and mental 
health to combat the crisis. Meanwhile, Hamilton 
Center, Inc., a regional behavioral health system in 
Indiana, will receive $75,000 for a pilot program 
to help those with an opioid use disorder who are 
unemployed or want to remain in the workforce while 
seeking treatment for their substance use disorder.

Separately, Duke Energy also is helping communities 
prepare for hurricanes in the wake of several major 
storms that have hit the Carolinas and Florida in 
recent years.

In Florida, a $500,000 grant to local organizations 
helped assemble and distribute storm preparedness kits 
to vulnerable customers, who may not have the means 
to access the materials in other ways.

In North Carolina, the company announced more 
than $1.1 million in funding to help local communities 
increase their response capabilities for future weather 
events with advance preparation and planning.

A Powerful Commitment to Human Rights 

Duke Energy works every day to power customers’ lives 
and help communities thrive. A strong commitment 
to safety, integrity and service drives our daily 
efforts and future vision. We amplify this in our 
Human Rights Policy. 

The cornerstones of this policy can be found in the 
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. Internally, a Code of Business Ethics

Wind power project in Texas: The sun and wind are helping Duke Energy reduce carbon emissions.

To accelerate the 
company’s transition to 
cleaner energy solutions, 
Duke Energy is planning 
to double its portfolio 
of solar, wind and 
biomass by 2025.

In Florida, the company’s Lake Placid and 
Trenton Solar Power plants came online, 
bringing nearly 120 MW to customers. In 
addition, the company announced other 
solar and battery projects, continuing 
its progress to add 700 MW of solar 
generation through 2022, while projecting 
to double its solar investments in the state 
by 2028.

Our Commercial Renewables business 
continues to grow as we announced 
approximately 1,500 MW in new projects, 
which will be placed into service by the 
end of 2020. This included our largest 
solar facility to date, the 150-MW North 
Rosamond solar project in California, 
which started operation in June. As well, 
our 200-MW Mesteño Windpower project 
in Texas began commercial operation in 
December, producing enough energy to 
power about 60,000 average homes. 

Looking ahead, Commercial Renewables 
has nearly 1,300 MW of wind and 
solar energy in late-stage development 
– the majority of which will come online 
in 2020. 

Renewable Energy’s Growth 
Continues to Accelerate 

To achieve net-zero carbon emissions 
by 2050, renewable generation will be 
important to Duke Energy’s strategy 
and will become a growing part of 
the diversified portfolio the company 
is building to reliably meet customer 
demand. To accelerate the company’s 
transition to cleaner energy solutions, 
Duke Energy is planning to double its 
portfolio of solar, wind and biomass 
by 2025.

The company has added more than 
2,500 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity 
to our grid over the past four years, 
including significant growth in North 
Carolina that helped keep the state second 
in the nation for solar capacity. 

In 2019, the company was awarded 
approximately 190 MW of utility-scale 
solar under North Carolina House Bill 
589. Most of the projects will come online 
in 2021. The number of customers that 
installed or received a rebate under our 
$62 million multiyear rebate program 
in North Carolina increased by nearly 
1,700 – bringing the total to 3,600 
rebates. The program has doubled rooftop 
solar in the state in its first two years. 
Duke Energy also launched a Green 
Source Advantage program, helping large 
customers and municipalities meet their 
sustainability goals.

Duke Energy remains a national leader in building batteries to store electricity.

Battery Storage Projects Take Off 

Duke Energy has been a leader in battery energy 
storage since 2013 when the 36-megawatt (MW) 
Notrees Energy Storage project came online next to a 
company wind farm in Texas.

Duke Energy continues to push ahead in the emerging 
battery storage market. The versatility of battery storage 
systems makes the technology a natural extension 
of the energy grid. The company will apply years of 
engineering and operating experience to maximize its 
full potential.

Duke Energy plans to spend roughly $600 million over 
the next five to 10 years to expand battery storage by 
almost 400 MW. A number of these projects made 
significant progress in 2019.

In Nabb, Indiana, a battery will be installed near an 
existing substation. This installation will be used to 
provide grid benefits as well as backup customer power 
in the event of a power outage.

Also in Indiana, a customer microgrid solution that 
includes a 2-MW solar array and a 5-MW battery for 
energy storage is under construction at the National 
Guard’s Camp Atterbury site.

In Florida, the 5.5-MW Cape San Blas lithium-
based battery facility will be located about 40 miles 
southeast of Panama City in Gulf County. The project 
is an economical alternative to replacing distribution 
equipment necessary to accommodate local 
load growth.

In Madison County, North Carolina, a microgrid system 
will consist of a 2-MW solar facility and a 4-MW 
lithium-based storage facility. This will provide a 
safe, cost-effective and reliable grid solution to serve 
hundreds of customers in the Hot Springs community. It 
will also provide support services to the overall grid.

Of course, batteries are not the only energy storage 
method. The company has more than 2,000 MW of 
pumped storage hydro power. Over the next three 
years, Duke Energy will increase the capacity at its Bad 
Creek facility in South Carolina by about 320 MW as it 
upgrades the facility.

Making a Charge for More 
Electric Vehicles

The transportation sector produces more carbon 
dioxide emissions than any other industry in the United 
States. But Duke Energy is working to implement 
programs to trim those emissions by promoting 
electric transportation.

In Florida, the company’s Park and Plug program has 
installed over 400 public charging stations in the state, 
with more than 80 stations targeting lower-income 
neighborhoods. 

Last year, those stations helped offset more than 
500,000 tons of carbon dioxide. They also saved 
more than 27,000 gallons of gasoline. By 2022, the 
company will have installed more than 500 public 
charging stations in Florida.

Duke Energy has installed over 400 public electric vehicle charging stations in Florida.

Duke Energy is also practicing what it 
preaches. The company has roughly 
600 electric vehicles in its fleet, 
including 230 on-road electric vehicles.

In order to lower overall emissions, 
Duke Energy continues to take a 
proactive approach to decarbonizing the 
electric transportation sector – one plug 
at a time.

Growing Sustainably in Five 
Key Areas 

Duke Energy continues to build a 
sustainable and smarter energy future:

 ■ Modernizing the energy grid. 

Duke Energy is building a smarter 
energy grid that gives customers 
more control over their energy usage, 
boosts customer convenience, 
accommodates additional renewable 
energy, increases service reliability 
and bolsters energy system 
security – both physical and cyber. 
(See related article on page 18, 
“Connecting Customers to a Smarter 
Energy Future.”)

In North Carolina, the company 
has proposed a $76 million electric 
transportation program, which would 
be the largest investment in electric 
vehicle infrastructure in the southeastern 
United States. The plan, which includes 
2,000 charging stations, has received 
widespread support from business, 
customer and environmental groups. 
The North Carolina Utilities Commission 
is currently reviewing the proposal. 

Under Duke Energy’s proposal, the 
company would offer rebates to 
customers for residential charging 
stations. It would position public fast 
charging stations in strategic locations 
around North Carolina. And it would 
help vehicle fleets go all electric.

Combined, we plan to support the 
deployment of nearly 7,500 electric 
vehicle chargers across our service 
territories, including Indiana, Kentucky, 
Ohio, Florida and the Carolinas. These 
deployments would support residential, 
fleet, public transit and highway 
fast charging.

Grants from Duke Energy have already 
helped the North Carolina cities of 
Raleigh, Asheville and Greensboro 
expand their fleets to include electric 
buses. In all cases, the company 
contributed to charging infrastructure 
that allowed the cities to spend more on 
purchasing new electric buses.

 ■ Generating cleaner energy. Duke Energy continues 
to generate cleaner electricity by investing in natural 
gas, solar and wind energy projects – and by 
maintaining its existing fleet of carbon-free nuclear 
power plants. In 2019, the company announced 
a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions 
from electric generation by 2050. The company 
simultaneously announced a near-term goal of cutting 
carbon emissions by at least 50 percent or more by 
2030, from 2005 levels. In addition to using new 
renewable energy facilities to reach those goals, the 
company also said it would seek federal approval to 
renew the operating licenses of the six carbon-free 
nuclear power plants it currently operates for an 
additional 20 years. (See related article on page 36, 
“Duke Energy’s Path to Net-Zero Carbon.”) 

 ■ Expanding natural gas infrastructure. Natural gas 
continues to play a major role in Duke Energy’s 
cleaner energy future. Deploying low-cost natural 
gas helps speed the transition away from coal, 
maintain reliability and balance the intermittent 
nature of renewables. The company is investing in 
natural gas-fired power plants, an interstate natural 
gas pipeline, and the retrofitting of coal-fired power 
plants to enable them to also burn lower carbon-
emitting natural gas. (See related article on page 32, 
“Natural Gas Enables Cleaner Energy Future.”)

 ■ Transforming the customer experience. Duke Energy 

is working hard to further improve the customer 
experience. New technology is shortening and 
sometimes eliminating power outages. Smart 
meters are giving customers new ways to manage 
and reduce electricity usage, saving them money. 
New communications tools are being developed 
based on customer input. (See related article on 
page 19, “Transforming the Customer Experience 
Through Action.”)

 ■ Engaging stakeholders. Fortune magazine named 
Duke Energy to its 2020 “World’s Most Admired 
Companies” list – an indication that Duke Energy’s 
many diverse stakeholders value the company’s 
commitment to a sustainable future. The company 
continues to work collaboratively with regulators, 
legislators, environmentalists, consumer advocates 
and many others on its multiple sustainability and 
modernization initiatives. (See related article on 
page 10, “The Value of Our Stakeholders.”)

existing companies in those states 
to expand at home, rather than 
look elsewhere.

The team includes experts in multiple 
target markets, including aerospace, 
data centers, advanced manufacturing, 
automotive, life sciences and food/
beverage processing.

In 2019, the team evaluated 
21 properties in Duke Energy’s 
service areas for potential business 
and industrial development through 
Duke Energy’s Site Readiness Program.

Through that program, Duke Energy 
partners with local economic 
development agencies to identify 
potential industrial sites, assess the sites’ 
strengths and weaknesses, facilitate site 
improvements, and market the sites to 
future industry.

Since its 2005 launch, the program has 
evaluated 280 sites – with 46 project 
wins that generated $8 billion in new 
capital investment and 10,420 new jobs.

In 2019, Duke Energy also provided 
more than $2 million to local economic 
development agencies and initiatives 
to fund job creation and business 
development projects.

“Economic development is vital to the 
states, communities and customers 
served by Duke Energy,” says Stu 
Heishman, Duke Energy’s vice president

Encouraging Civic Participation at 
All Levels 

Duke Energy serves 7.8 million electric and 1.6 million 
natural gas customers across seven different states, and 
employs nearly 30,000 people. With complex political 
and policy landscapes at the state and federal levels, it 
is important that there is a balanced view on issues to 
ensure the best interest of Duke Energy customers and 
employees are top of mind. 

DukePAC, a voluntary, nonpartisan political action 
committee, leverages the collective financial 
contributions of eligible employees to support political 
organizations and candidates who share the concerns 
and best interests of Duke Energy employees and 
customers. In 2019, DukePAC’s total contributions 
were $633,930. 

DukePAC also serves as a key resource in its ability to 
educate employees, encouraging their increased civic 
participation at all levels. 

Through engagement with local communities, 
lawmakers, and stakeholders, Duke Energy is also 
able to advocate for state-specific policies at the state 
capitals in its service territory. The company also 
advocates for innovative and practical policies at the 
federal level that further the good progress made by the 
company, and the industry as a whole. 

Duke Energy’s total reportable federal lobbying expenses 
in 2019 were $5,284,510. That amount includes the 
$963,720 federal lobbying portion of trade association 
dues (includes dues in excess of $50,000) to support 
policy research and advocacy. The company also 
contributed approximately $1,194,660 to Section 
527 organizations created to support the nomination, 
election, appointment or defeat of a candidate. (For 
additional details, see Duke Energy’s Corporate Political 
Expenditure Reports.)

31 | 2019 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

2GROWTHDuke Energy’s Political Expenditures Policy requires 
compliance with laws and regulations governing political 
contributions, government interaction and lobbying 
activities. It also requires a semiannual update on 
political expenditures to the Corporate Governance 
Committee of the Duke Energy Board of Directors. 
The company is legally prohibited from making direct 
contributions to candidates for U.S. federal offices and 
certain state offices.

Natural Gas Enables Cleaner 
Energy Future 

Natural gas continues to play a central role as 
Duke Energy moves toward a cleaner, lower-carbon 
energy future. This low-cost fuel source is helping 
the company retire coal plants faster and balance the 
intermittent nature of renewables.

In 2020, the company’s new natural gas-fired Asheville 
Combined Cycle Station in Buncombe County, North 
Carolina, became operational. The power plant replaced 
a 56-year-old, higher carbon-emitting, coal-fired plant. 

The natural gas plant is 75 percent more efficient 
than the retired coal plant. In addition, the new 
plant’s carbon dioxide emissions are 60 percent lower 
(per megawatt hour), sulfur dioxide emissions are 
99 percent lower, and nitrogen oxides emissions are 
40 percent lower than the coal plant’s emissions. 
Mercury emissions have been eliminated.

Duke Energy also has retrofitted two units at its 
coal-fired Rogers Energy Complex near Cliffside, 
North Carolina, enabling the power plant to burn a 
combination of natural gas and coal – rather than coal 
only – to reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions.

A similar natural gas retrofitting project has been 
completed on one unit (and is underway on a second 
unit) at Duke Energy’s Belews Creek Steam Station, a 
coal-fired power plant in Stokes County, North Carolina. 
Natural gas retrofitting work also is underway at the 
company’s Marshall Steam Station, a coal-fired power 
plant in Catawba County, North Carolina.

In addition, Duke Energy in 2019 continued expansion 
work at its Lincoln Combustion Turbine Station, a 
natural gas-fired power plant near Denver, North 
Carolina. The company is adding a new unit that will 

significantly increase the plant’s electricity output, 
particularly during periods of high customer demand. 
When fully operational in 2024, the new unit will 
be about 34 percent more efficient than the plant’s 
16 existing units. 

Meanwhile, legal and regulatory work on another 
natural gas project – the proposed Atlantic Coast 
Pipeline – continues. The approximately 600-mile 
underground natural gas pipeline, partly owned by 
Duke Energy, would start in West Virginia and traverse 
Virginia and eastern North Carolina before ending in 
Robeson County, North Carolina.

The pipeline’s natural gas would be used in Virginia 
and North Carolina to fuel power plants and industrial 
facilities, heat homes and businesses, support local 
economic development, and ensure that natural gas 
utilities have enough natural gas to meet growing 
customer demand.

Additional court and regulatory rulings related to the 
pipeline’s review and approval process are expected 
in 2020.

Strong Results for Shareholders and 
Value for Customers 

In 2019, Duke Energy achieved adjusted earnings 
per share of $5.06, delivering 7 percent growth 
for the year. It was a strong year for Duke Energy 
– the company met its commitments to customers, 
advanced its long-term strategy and exceeded 
growth expectations. 

Our electric, gas and commercial renewables 
businesses all experienced growth in 2019, which was 
helped by base rate increases in the Carolinas and 
Florida, customer growth in our gas businesses and 
new renewables projects placed in service.

In 2019, the company issued $2 billion in preferred 
stock and priced $2.5 billion in equity. These proactive 
steps strengthened the balance sheet, paving the 
way for a substantial increase in our five-year capital 
plan, significantly increasing the earnings potential 
of the company to the benefit of our communities 
and shareholders.

Given 2019 results and our revised capital plan, the 
company announced on February 13, 2020 its 2020 
adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 
to $5.45, with a midpoint of $5.25 per share – and 
extended its long-term growth rate of 4 to 6 percent 
through 2024. 

Duke Energy remains committed to offering an 
attractive, long-term value proposition to its 
shareholders. 2020 marks the company’s 94th 
consecutive year paying a dividend to its investors, and 
Duke Energy grew the dividend 2 percent in 2019. The 
company’s dividend yield continues to be one of the 
highest in the industry.

Duke Energy completed two green bond issuances 
– one for Duke Energy Progress and another for 
Duke Energy Florida, bringing total green bond 
issuances to $2.3 billion across the company. The 
funds will finance eligible green energy projects – 
including zero-carbon solar and energy storage. 

Duke Energy’s total shareholder return – measured 
as the change in stock price plus the reinvestment of 
dividends – for 2019 was 10.3 percent. The company 
is proud of the returns it is delivering to investors but 
also recognizes this lagged peer utilities.

Despite providing investors with clarity around key 
issues in 2019 – such as balance sheet strength and 
coal ash basin closure progress – Duke Energy’s total 
shareholder return was not as strong as many peer 
utilities due to uncertainties around coal ash closure 
cost recovery in the Carolinas and the Atlantic Coast 
Pipeline. We expect to achieve more clarity on these 
uncertainties in 2020 and 2021.

Looking longer term, Duke Energy is confident in its 
underlying business fundamentals and strategy, which 
are underpinned by the outstanding communities we 
serve. We are focused on delivering strong, long-term 
returns for our shareholders and providing industry-
leading service to our customers for years to come.

Duke Energy continues 
to achieve significant 
decreases in overall 
carbon emissions, driven 
largely by utilizing 
more natural gas and 
renewables generation 
and less coal.

To reach our net-zero 2050 target, 
we must have additional non-emitting 
technologies. We are working with 
the private and public sectors to 
drive research, development and 
demonstration of new technologies – 
such as longer-duration (up to seasonal) 
storage, carbon capture, advanced 
nuclear and new, carbon-free solutions 
that don’t exist yet at scale. 

The company has taken a holistic 
approach to managing the climate issue 
that includes three key areas of focus: 
adaptation, mitigation and innovation. 

 ■ Adaptation – Duke Energy is 

preparing for the changing global 
climate, including water conservation 
and storm preparation.

 ■ Mitigation – Duke Energy is working 

to slow climate change with a 
variety of carbon-reduction and land 
conservation efforts. 

 ■ Innovation – Duke Energy is helping 
drive the technology necessary for 
a carbon-free future, including grid 
modernization and new technologies. 

The company has already made

Duke Energy’s Path to  
Net-Zero Carbon 

Duke Energy is serious about doing 
its part to deliver the cleaner energy 
future that its customers want and 
deserve, while keeping energy affordable 
and reliable.

In September 2019, the company 
refreshed its climate strategy and 
announced the acceleration of its 
carbon-reduction goals from electric 
generation. Duke Energy’s new goals 
are to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
at least 50 percent by 2030 from 
2005 levels, and strive to be net-zero 
by 2050. The company is the largest 
power generator in the United States to 
have such a net-zero goal. 

Duke Energy continues to achieve 
significant decreases in overall carbon 
emissions, driven largely by utilizing 
more natural gas and renewables 
generation and less coal. As of year-
end 2019, the company has reduced 
carbon emissions by 39 percent from 
2005 levels. 

While there are many factors that 
influence emissions on an annual 
basis, Duke Energy is confident in 
its ability to meet its 2030 goal of at 
least a 50 percent carbon emissions 
reduction, and its 2050 goal of net-zero 
carbon emissions. 

Achieving these ambitious goals requires 
a bold vision and a pragmatic strategy. 
This vision includes continuing to 
modernize the current fleet and grid with 
increased investments in renewables, 
storage, natural gas and energy 
efficiency. Importantly, the company 
plans to continue to operate its existing 
nuclear fleet and retire coal plants.

36 | 2019 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

OPERATIONS3Nuclear power remains 
Duke Energy’s largest 
greenhouse gas 
emissions-free generator.

Duke Energy’s nuclear power plant teams generate carbon-free electricity around the clock.

In 2019, the Duke Energy nuclear fleet 
generated almost 74 billion kilowatt-
hours of electricity and avoided the 
release of more than 52 million tons of 
carbon dioxide – equivalent to keeping 
more than 11 million passenger cars off 
the road.

U.S. nuclear facilities are licensed 
by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission and were originally 
licensed to operate for 40 years based 
on economic considerations, not 
technology limitations.

Regulations allow nuclear licensees to 
renew their licenses for up to 20 years 
at a time. All Duke Energy-operated 
nuclear units have received one renewed 
license for an additional 20 years. The 
process to renew licenses for a second 
20 years requires a comprehensive 
analysis and evaluation to ensure the 
units can safely operate for the extended 
operation period.

Nuclear Essential to Meeting 
Carbon Goals 

Nuclear power remains Duke Energy’s 
largest greenhouse gas emissions-free 
generator. And the company plans 
to rely on it as it seeks to be carbon 
neutral by 2050.

In September 2019, the company 
announced it would seek to renew the 
operating licenses of the 11 reactors it 
operates at six nuclear stations in the 
Carolinas for an additional 20 years.

The first nuclear plants will approach 
the end of their current operating 
licenses in the early 2030s. Rigorous, 
ongoing preventive maintenance 
programs across the nuclear fleet and 
technology upgrades and investments 
over the years have contributed to 
their continuing strong operating 
performance. In 2019, Duke Energy’s 
nuclear fleet marked its 21st 
consecutive year with a fleet capacity 
factor – a measure of reliability – greater 
than 90 percent. 

The company expects to submit 
the license renewal application for 
Oconee Nuclear Station in South 
Carolina in 2021, followed by its other 
nuclear stations.

Duke Energy Remains 
Committed to Worker Safety 

Despite an improving safety trend, 
Duke Energy tragically experienced 
three work-related fatalities and two 
life-altering injuries in 2019. By working 
internally and with other Edison 
Electric Institute companies in 2020, 
Duke Energy will continue our efforts to 
reduce the number of serious injuries 
and become an even safer workplace.

The company is committed to leading 
the industry in safety by proactively 
addressing risk and empowering 
employees. Workers put safety first by 
actively caring, recognizing hazards and 
taking accountability for their actions. 

Consistent with our industry-leading 
performance from previous years, 
employees continued to deliver strong 
safety results in 2019, meeting our 
target total incident case rate. Since 
2012, the company has reduced 
its number of recordable injuries by 
46 percent.

To enhance safety performance, the 
company used data to identify safety 
risks and prevent injuries before 
they occurred. New programs and 
technologies also improved employee 
safety behavior through better on-the-
job observations.

In addition to injury reduction initiatives, 
Duke Energy introduced a decentralized 
safety governance model to improve 
accountability. The Environmental, 
Health and Safety business unit 
primarily provides direction and 
oversight, allowing safety professionals 
to directly support daily operations.

Duke Energy also continues to provide 
work-life programs to support the health 
and overall well-being of employees. 

Turning the Corner on  
Coal Ash 

A year of strong momentum in ash basin 
closure culminated with a breakthrough 
achievement that puts the coal ash 
debate to rest in North Carolina. 
Duke Energy, state regulators and 
environmental groups agreed to a plan 
to permanently close the company’s 
remaining nine coal ash basins, primarily 
by excavation with ash moved to 
lined landfills. 

This reasonable, common-sense 
approach protects people and the 
environment while keeping costs in 
check as much as possible, saving 
approximately $1.5 billion when 
compared to the full excavation order that 
state regulators issued on April 1, 2019.

Duke Energy scientists ensure lakes and rivers next to power plants remain clean and healthy. 

Duke Energy had appealed that 
decision; the settlement resolves that 
appeal as well as all other pending 
environmental litigation related to basin 
closure methods in North Carolina.

The company made tremendous 
progress safely closing its other basins 
– nearly 28 million tons of ash have 
been excavated across all of our service 
territories since closure began.

Notably, basin excavation was 
completed at several power plants: 
Dan River Steam Station (Eden, 
North Carolina), along with Sutton 
Plant (Wilmington, North Carolina), 
Riverbend Steam Station (Mount Holly, 
North Carolina), East Bend Station 
(Union, Kentucky), and the second of 
three basins at W.S. Lee Steam Station 
(Williamston, South Carolina). 

In Indiana, Duke Energy received 
approval from state regulators for 
the closure and post-closure plans 
for several of its basins; discussions 
continue to move toward resolution on 
the others.

Systemwide, the company completed 
technology upgrades at its operating 
coal plants to take all ash basins 
permanently out of service, with the 
exception of Gallagher Station (Floyd 
County, Indiana) since it is being retired 
in 2022. 

Production ash is now handled dry 
– either in lined landfills or recycled. 
Additionally, the company is nearing 
completion on ash recycling facilities at 
three retired coal plant sites in North 
Carolina to reprocess ash for use in 
concrete beginning in 2020. 

Learn more about how we are leading 
the industry in safely closing ash basins. 

Environmental Scientists 
Protect Lakes and Habitat 

In lakes and rivers adjacent to its power 
plants, scientists from Duke Energy 
take water samples, survey the fish 
population, and collect habitat and lake 
health information throughout the year.

What does that have to do with 
generating power? The data helps 
optimize plant operations while also 
complying with state and federal 
regulatory requirements that protect the 
public and the environment. 

Duke Energy’s scientific monitoring has 
been underway for 60 years in some 
water bodies, allowing the company, 
governmental agencies and other 
stakeholders to see long-term trends and 
confirm that environmental conditions 
remain healthy for aquatic life and 
human use.

Duke Energy wildlife biologist Tim Hayes protects animals and plants at renewable energy sites.

Samples are handled under strict guidelines and 
sent to regulators for independent verification, using 
scientifically established procedures with a robust 
quality assurance process in the field and the lab.

Lake Norman north of Charlotte, North Carolina, for 
example, was created by Duke Energy as home to 
three generating facilities: Cowans Ford Hydro Station, 
Marshall Steam Station and McGuire Nuclear Station. 
The company has conducted scientific monitoring of the 
lake since 1959, collecting more than 20,000 samples 
with nearly 1.5 million individual test results. 

Such tests aren’t limited to areas immediately around 
generating facilities – the company collects samples 
from over 70 locations lakewide, including near each 
public drinking water intake, sharing data with local 
municipalities. Additionally, semiannual fish testing 
by Duke Energy scientists demonstrates that fish are 
healthy and thriving; sample results are independently 
tested and verified by state resource agencies.

Similar tests (such as water quality monitoring and fish 
sampling) are conducted across all 27 North Carolina 
water bodies managed by the company, as well as 
several waterbodies within South Carolina and Indiana. 
In sum, decades of scientific monitoring confirm that 
Duke Energy facilities continue to be safely operated 
under strict permits designed to protect public health 
and the environment.

Keeping the Lights On and 
Protecting Wildlife 

Duke Energy Renewables Environmental Development 
Director Tim Hayes spends a lot of time looking at 
the ground.

That might seem odd, but it’s the way of a wildlife 
biologist. Eyes pointed just beyond his feet, he looks for 
tufts of fur, tracks, and even scat for clues as to what 
wildlife lives near solar and wind sites.

People are often surprised to learn energy companies 
have biologists, but it’s imperative as the company 
expands renewables. When his team isn’t looking for 
wildlife, they’re working with government agencies, 
nonprofits and technology developers to create policies, 
products and plans that keep wildlife safe while 
producing clean energy that customers depend on.

Before construction, they survey species, consult with 
wildlife agencies, perform biological surveys and decide 
if the site will move on to construction or if the wildlife 
risk is too great. 

During construction, Duke Energy hires consultants 
who specialize in the area’s threatened or endangered 
plants and animals. At Mesteño Wind Project, the team 
worked around species like the Texas tortoise.

The crew built a dirt road through an area Hayes calls 
a hotbed of tortoise activity. The area was unavoidable, 
but the tortoise loves the thick brush (a shady place 
to rest), good soil and plentiful water, so the team 
educated workers about the tortoise and set a 5 mph 
speed limit.

Reliable Power 

Reliable power is one of Duke Energy’s most important commitments to its 7 .8 million 
electric customers . To help improve reliability performance, each year the company 
sets customer delivery and generation reliability targets .

Customer Delivery

In 2019, Duke Energy began using the customer delivery reliability measure, which 
takes into account the average duration of outages, customers experiencing multiple 
outages and customers experiencing lengthy outages . The 2019 target was 100 or 
higher, and the result was 144 .

Generation

Duke Energy’s diverse generation fleet with carbon-free nuclear, hydro, wind 
and solar; lower-carbon natural gas; and higher-carbon coal and oil reliably met 
customer demand . 

The nuclear fleet optimized reliability, which is a measure of generation reliability 
along with the cost to achieve that reliability, continued a five-year positive trend, 
with a 2019 index of 183 .36 . The fossil/hydro fleet’s optimized reliability continued its 
five-year positive trend, with a 2019 index of 57 .83 . The commercial fleet’s renewables 
availability was 94 percent, showing solid performance in 2019 .

Once a site is in production, they 
monitor ecosystem health. When the 
results are unexpected, Hayes’ team 
finds solutions. At Los Vientos Wind 
Project, the team noticed higher than 
expected bat fatalities, which was an 
opportunity to test a new Bat Deterrent 
System. The two-year study reduced 
overall fatalities by half, and now 
they’re pursuing the continental United 
States’ first commercial installation of 
the technology. 

As the industry grows, it’s vital to find 
solutions like these. Hayes knows it’s 
not a problem he can solve on his own, 
but he’s glad to be part of the solution.

Staying Ahead of 
Cyber Threats 

Cybersecurity continues to be 
a growing national topic. From 
threats to the financial, utilities 
and telecommunications sectors to 
concerns of election meddling and 
ongoing email phishing campaigns 
to expose personal information. 

Threats continue to grow and bad actors 
continue to become more sophisticated 
as they target their audiences. 

As Duke Energy uses more digital 
capabilities, modernizes the energy 
grid and introduces new applications, 
including the customer app, the 
company is staying ahead to protect 
the grid, our generating assets and 
customer, employee and shareholder 
information. As the largest operator of 
the energy grid, using a multilayered 
approach with many safeguards for 
cybersecurity is a top priority for 
Duke Energy. 

Duke Energy continues to modernize 
its cyber protection processes. 
The company is implementing 
security measures for operational 
technology, such as substations, power 
plants and new grid mechanisms.

In an effort to protect 
its systems and

Duke Energy routinely 
shares information, 
lessons learned and 
best practices with 
industry partners, peer 
utilities and government 
agencies, including the 
Department of Homeland 
Security and the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation.

The massive redfish release effort 
resulted from a partnership between 
Duke Energy and the Coastal 
Conservation Association Florida (CCA). 
Employees at Duke Energy’s Mariculture 
Center in Crystal River, Florida spawned 
and raised 34,000 juvenile “fingerlings” 
and 300 adult redfish. Members of CCA 
Florida arranged the release events after 
Duke Energy received permits from 
Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Commission. 

By late 2019, release events were 
completed within a 500-mile span 
between the Pan Handle’s Gulf 
County to Collier County on the 
southwest coast.

Fingerlings were released in locations 
lined with mangroves and other hiding 
places to increase their survival chances 
against predators. Adults, which can 
live for up to 40 years, were tagged and 
hand-released. If caught, anglers can 
help researchers by calling the phone 
number on the tag. 

Will 34,300 redfish make a difference? 
One female redfish can spawn up 
to 2 million eggs per batch, making 
millions of new redfish a possibility. 
That’s encouraging news for Florida’s 
delicate coastal ecosystem – including 
those counting on its longevity to thrive. 

Duke Energy also has a dedicated 
team focused on educating employees 
and increasing awareness of 
threats – from routine test phishing 
emails and annual trainings to 
seminars and video resources. 

The company maintains an incident 
response team of highly-skilled 
cybersecurity professionals who identify, 
mitigate and engage organizations 
across the company, as well as 
local, state and federal agencies to 
respond to issues. And, to ensure we 
are adequately prepared to respond, 
the company conducts drills to test 
emergency response plans and ensure 
employees understand their role in case 
an event occurs.

In an effort to protect its systems and 
engage stakeholders, Duke Energy 
routinely shares information, lessons 
learned and best practices with industry 
partners, peer utilities and government

The Power of Partnership in 
Red Tide Recovery 

Residents and tourists along Florida’s 
world-famous Gulf Coast often enjoy 
catching the popular red drum, or 
redfish. Yet in the wake of a historic red 
tide bloom, anglers of all ages released 
tens of thousands of the fish instead.

Red tide occurs naturally during 
most late summers from a bloom of 
dinoflagellate (algae) that usually dies 
off in weeks. When a 2017 bloom 
lingered into 2019, heartbreaking losses 
of manatees, sea turtles, fish and other 
marine life resulted.

45 | 2019 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

Water withdrawn and consumed 
for electric generation

Water withdrawn is the total volume removed 
from a water source, such as a lake or a river . 
Because of the once-through cooling systems 
on many of our coal-fired and nuclear plants, 
over 98 percent of this water is returned to 
the source and available for other uses . Water 
consumed is the amount of water removed for 
use and not returned to the source . 

Emissions from electric generation

Many factors influence emissions levels and 
intensities, including generation diversity and 
efficiency, demand for electricity, weather, 
fuel and purchased power prices, and 
emissions controls deployed . Since 2005, our 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased 
by 39 percent, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions 
decreased by 97 percent and nitrogen oxides 
(NOX) emissions decreased by 79 percent . 
These decreases are primarily due to addition 
of pollution control equipment, decreased coal 
generation, increased natural gas generation 
and replacement of higher-emitting plants . 

Methane emissions from  
pipeline operations

Methane (CH4) is the primary component of 
natural gas, and is a greenhouse gas . We 
work to minimize methane emissions, but 
some is released during pipeline operations 
and maintenance . Duke Energy is a founding 
partner of the U .S . EPA’s Natural Gas Star 
Methane Challenge program, which is aimed 
at cost-effective technologies and practices 
that improve operational efficiency and 
reduce methane emissions .

Sulfur hexafluoride emissions

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an insulating gas 
used in high-voltage electric transmission 
and distribution switchgear equipment, and 
is a greenhouse gas . We work to minimize 
SF6 emissions, but some is released during 
transmission and distribution operations 
and maintenance .

Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)

Duke Energy’s TRI releases for 2018 were 
down 84 percent from 2007, primarily due 
to the significant investments we’ve made 
in environmental controls for our power 
plants, and decreased coal generation . 
Recently increased releases were largely 
due to coal ash basins and their closure 
operations . These releases are expected to 
decrease significantly as coal ash basins are 
closed . (Data for 2019 will be available in 
August 2020 .)

Waste

Due to downturns in market demand for 
waste wood for biomass generation, we did 
not meet our goal to recycle 80 percent of 
our solid waste . We are working on strategies 
to improve performance on this goal in the 
future . (This goal excludes Duke Energy 
Renewables, which has a relatively small 
waste stream .) 

Reportable oil spills

Oil spills include releases of lubricating 
oil from generating stations, leaks from 
transformers, or damage caused by weather 
or by third parties (typically because of 
auto accidents) .

Environmental regulatory citations

Fines/penalties were relatively large in 2016 
because of a 2014 oil spill at the Beckjord 
Station in Ohio, and a 2014 coal ash spill . 
See the “Legal Cases Resolved” article in 
the 2015 Sustainability Report . The increase 
in the number of citations from 2018 to 
2019 was due mostly to an increase in 
water discharge reporting and compliance 
issues, which have been resolved with 
regulatory authorities .

EMPLOYEES4Duke Energy maintains a diverse, inclusive work environment built on teamwork and collaboration.

Strengthening a culture 
of inclusion takes every 
employee within the 
company understanding 
their part in making each 
other feel welcomed, 
respected, heard 
and valued for the 
perspectives they bring 
to the company.

Duke Energy representatives attend 
career events at historically black 
colleges and universities, military bases, 
professional societies and community 
events as one of the company’s many 
strategies to directly reach out to diverse 
talent and potential employees. 

Strengthening a culture of inclusion 
takes every employee within the 
company understanding their part in 
making each other feel welcomed, 
respected, heard and valued for the 
perspectives they bring to the company.

Our Employee Resource Groups 
(ERGs) and Diversity and Inclusion 
(D&I) councils help the company 
understand, and value the differences 
among employees, customers and 
communities and help foster an 
inclusive environment. 

The company’s D&I councils are 
embedded across the company in 
various business units. These councils 
focus on specific diversity and 
inclusion needs of the business and 
help drive inclusion deeper into the 
employee experience.

Strengthening Our Culture of 
Diversity and Inclusion 

Duke Energy continues its commitment 
to build a diverse workforce that 
mirrors the communities it serves and 
is strengthening a culture of inclusion 
where employees and customers feel 
respected and valued throughout the 
company. This intentional effort not only 
applies to today; but is a sustainable 
part of our culture for the next 
generation workforce. 

Increasing the percentage of under-
represented employee groups, 
specifically females and minorities, 
is a Duke Energy priority. In fact, the 
company has an aspirational goal to 
increase the percentage of females and 
minorities in its workforce to 25 percent 
and 20 percent, respectively, by 
year-end 2020. Achieving these goals 
will require a balanced commitment to 
hiring external talent and continuing to 
develop and promote from within. 

Duke Energy has teams dedicated to 
recruiting diverse talent as external 
hiring opportunities arise. While always 
hiring the most qualified candidates, 
regardless of background, the company 
makes a strong effort to ensure 
diverse populations are aware of job 
opportunities when they are available.

Developing Tomorrow’s  
Workforce Today 

Sustainability is about being ready for the future. 
Duke Energy’s commitment to delivering a smarter 
energy future includes a commitment to developing 
the workforce that will be necessary for that future. 
Providing employees with the essential knowledge, 
development and skills they need to be safe and 
successful in a changing industry is part of our culture. 

That commitment also extends to developing 
tomorrow’s workforce. National concerns about 
declining student interest in science, technology, 
engineering and math studies – disciplines collectively 
known as STEM – have our attention. Individuals with 
these skills are the foundation of our work today and 
tomorrow. That’s why part of Duke Energy’s strategy for 
developing a sustainable workforce includes reaching 
into local education systems to bring energy career 
awareness to educators, students and parents. 

Duke Energy has established relationships with local 
community colleges that offer programs in the STEM 
studies essential to the future. Students are prepared 
for possible future employment in the energy industry 
as lineworkers, solar technicians and other careers. 

Our education efforts don’t stop there, however. In 
fact, they start much earlier. Duke Energy employees 
have strong local connections and take pride in sharing 
their knowledge and histories. Using a speaker toolkit 
developed expressly for this purpose, employees 
share information about Duke Energy and the many 
career opportunities that exist within the changing 
energy industry. 

Maintaining a skilled workforce includes a focus on 
today without losing sight of tomorrow. That’s why 
planting the seeds of interest in an energy career 
must begin early and remain a key strategy for today 
and tomorrow.

Duke Energy’s highly skilled lineworkers use drones and computers to keep power flowing.

To ensure a pipeline 
of future employees, 
Duke Energy has been 
funding strategic 
initiatives to help 
enhance and diversify 
the energy industry’s 
workforce of tomorrow.

In 2019, more than 1,000 lineworkers 
from the United States, Canada 
and Australia competed and our 
Duke Energy linemen roped in six 
awards, with North Carolina’s Mike 
Haynes, David Phillips and Neal Walker 
taking home first place in the world for 
the journeyman senior division, ages 50 
and up.

While most people associate maintaining 
the grid with the manual work of setting 
poles and stringing lines, lineworkers are 
also using drones and computers in their 
trucks and relay technicians are making 
the self-healing grid possible. It takes 
highly skilled talent to tackle the ever-
changing needs of the industry.

But their work from the front lines is 
critical to powering our communities 
now and will continue to be in 
the future.

Lineworker Skills Always 
Being Fine-Tuned 

No one is more hands-on with 
the electric utility industry than 
lineworkers. To ensure a pipeline of 
future employees, Duke Energy has 
been funding strategic initiatives to 
help enhance and diversify the energy 
industry’s workforce of tomorrow.

The company has worked closely 
with community colleges and other 
educational organizations to attract 
a future workforce that will have the 
skills necessary to build and maintain 
a changing energy infrastructure.

But once workers get to Duke Energy, 
the fine-tuning of skills is not over. And 
being the best of the best doesn’t stop.

Every October in Bonner Springs, 
Kansas, the best lineworkers compete 
against the best in their trade at the 
International Lineman’s Rodeo. 

The Lineman’s Rodeo events test 
job-related skills like working safely 
while climbing fast, making repairs and 
rescuing an injured teammate while 
being judged on speed, agility, technique 
and safety procedures.

51 | 2019 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

EMPLOYEES4Duke Energy’s Code of Business Ethics 
describes ethics and compliance 
standards for Duke Energy employees. 
New employees are required to 
complete ethics and compliance training 
in the first 30 calendar days on the 
job. All employees also are annually 
required to: complete ethics refresher 
training; acknowledge their responsibility 
to comply with company ethics 
policies; and confirm their obligation 
to report violations of laws, rules or 
company policies.

The strength of Duke Energy’s ethics 
and compliance program is crucial to 
the company’s success and integrity, 
which depend on the continuing ability 
to earn the trust and confidence of 
our customers, employees, regulators, 
elected officials, shareholders, and other 
stakeholders. That success is dependent 
on every employee’s dedication and 
focus to ensure we consistently deliver 
results the right way, every day and in 
every job.

Learn more about Duke Energy’s ethics 
and employee engagement programs. 

Charging Ahead with Ethics 
and Compliance

Duke Energy is one the first U.S. 
electric and natural gas investor-owned 
utilities to receive Compliance Leader 
Verification. Duke Energy’s verification 
is for 2019 and 2020.

Awarded by the Ethisphere Institute, 
Compliance Leader Verification is 
awarded to companies with leading 
ethics and compliance programs. 

Ethisphere is an independent research 
center that provides thought leadership 
and promotes best practices in 
corporate ethics and compliance. 
It’s Duke Energy’s practice to seek 
an outside assessment of our ethics 
and compliance program about every 
five years.

Ethisphere’s Compliance Leader 
Verification process includes a 
comprehensive review of a company’s 
ethics and compliance program 
structure and oversight. It examines 
employee training and communications, 
risk measurement and mitigation, 
monitoring practices designed to 
expose misconduct, consistency in the 
application of disciplinary measures, and 
employee perceptions of the company’s 
ethics culture.

The strength of 
Duke Energy’s ethics and 
compliance program is 
crucial to the company’s 
success and integrity, 
which depend on the 
continuing ability to earn 
the trust and confidence 
of our customers, 
employees, regulators, 
elected officials, 
shareholders, and 
other stakeholders.

Non-GAAP Measures

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP 
financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS . 
These items represent income from continuing operations available to 
Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per-share amounts, adjusted 
for the dollar and per-share impact of special items . As discussed below, 
special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes 
are not indicative of Duke Energy’s ongoing performance . Management believes 
the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides 
useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant 
comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods .

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and 
forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, 
employees, stockholders, analysts and investors . Adjusted diluted EPS is also 
used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses . The most directly comparable 
GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are GAAP 
Reported Earnings and Diluted EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation 
common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively .

Special items included in the periods presented include the following, which 
management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

  Impairment Charges in 2019 represents a reduction of a prior year 

impairment at Citrus County CC and an OTTI on the remaining investment 
in Constitution . For 2018, it represents an impairment at Citrus County 
CC, a goodwill impairment at Commercial Renewables and an OTTI of an 
investment in Constitution . 

  Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from 

strategic acquisitions .

  Regulatory and Legislative Impacts in 2018 represents charges related to the 
Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas North Carolina rate case 
orders and the repeal of the South Carolina Base Load Review Act .

  Sale of Retired Plant represents the loss associated with selling Beckjord, a 

nonregulated generating facility in Ohio .

  Impacts of the Tax Act represents amounts recognized related to the Tax Act .
  Severance Charges relate to companywide initiatives, excluding merger 

integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and 
workforce optimization .

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other 
companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner .
