A Message From Our CEO

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS:

Sustainability means different things  
to different people. To me, it comes 
down to enduring business success  
and responsible stewardship. We’ll do 
this by understanding stakeholders’ 
needs, running our business with 
excellence and adapting to an ever-
changing industry. 

Duke Energy is the largest electric 
utility in the U.S. Although our size is 
a strength, it’s not a guarantee that we 
will continue to be successful. We must 
be responsible, creative and driven to 
demonstrate that big can also mean 
agile, flexible and innovative. 

Lighting the way, the theme for this 
year’s publication, signifies our ongoing 
commitment to our stakeholders. It 
means we will strive for leadership, 
excellence and integrity in everything we 
do. And it reflects our desire to approach 
the future in a way that strengthens 
relationships, anticipates change and 
seizes new opportunities. 

SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITIES

Beginning in 1904, our company’s 
founders constructed hydroelectric 
power plants in an effort to create new 
opportunities for economic growth in  
the Carolinas. 

This mission to advance our 
communities continues today. We  
work with local officials to attract 
businesses and jobs, including more 
than $2.9 billion in capital investment 
and more than 13,700 new jobs to  
our six-state region in 2013. 

DUKE ENERGY l 4

Our charitable giving – including funding 
from The Duke Energy Foundation, 
company donations, employee and 
retiree gifts, and the value of volunteer 
hours – totaled about $73 million  
last year. 

EMPOWERED CUSTOMERS

Improving our customers’ experience 
with Duke Energy is just as important as 
helping our communities prosper. Now 
more than ever, customers want more – 
more control of their energy use, more 
opportunities to save and more ways  
to interact with us. We’ve responded 
with technologies and enhanced  
energy efficiency programs that aim  
to strengthen our role as a trusted 
energy partner. 

One way we’re helping customers 
thrive is by modernizing the power grid. 
We recently installed our 1 millionth 
smart meter in Ohio. This technology 
helps customers use energy more 
efficiently, and paves the way for us to 
introduce new products and services. 
Smart meters and other digital grid 
technologies also help improve power 
reliability by reducing the frequency  
and duration of outages. 

Beyond the meter, we’re giving 
customers options to save through 
energy efficiency initiatives, like our 
appliance recycling program. In 2013, 
we helped our customers recycle more 
than 25,000 inefficient refrigerators and 
freezers. With each recycled appliance, 
customers can save up to $150 a year 
on their energy bills.

Customers are also seeing the benefits 
of our 2012 merger with Progress 

Energy. Through reduced fuel costs and 
jointly dispatching our power plants, 
we’ve already achieved more than 25 
percent of the guaranteed $687 million 
in savings for our Carolinas customers. 

CLEANER ENERGY

In 2013, we completed a decade-long, 
$9 billion program to modernize our 
generation fleet. These investments 
improved our fuel diversity and enabled 
us to retire more than 3,800 megawatts 
of older coal-fired units. That number 
will grow to nearly 6,300 megawatts – 
roughly 25 percent of our coal capacity 
– by 2018.

We’ve also invested $7.5 billion in 
recent years to add environmental 
controls to our power plants. Our fleet 
modernization – along with lower natural 
gas prices – enabled us to cut our U.S. 
carbon emissions by 20 percent and 
reduce our carbon emissions intensity 
by 19 percent since 2005. We’ve also 
decreased our U.S. emissions of sulfur 
dioxide by 84 percent and nitrogen 
oxides by 63 percent during the  
same period.

Beyond cleaner energy from fossil fuels, 
Duke Energy is committed to promoting 
and using cost-effective renewable 
energy options. Solar power, for 
instance, complements our nuclear  
and fossil-fueled baseload plants that 
meet our customers’ energy needs  
when the sun isn’t shining. 

Solar energy is an important part of 
the energy future, and we want to 
encourage its development in ways that 
are fair to all customers. That’s why, in 
2013, we created a new organization to 

develop renewable energy projects for 
our regulated utilities. 

This work is in addition to projects 
spearheaded by Duke Energy 
Renewables, which has invested  
$3 billion since 2007 to build utility-
scale wind and solar farms in 12 states. 

WORKFORCE SAFETY

Cleaner energy is important, but safety is 
our top priority. I’m proud of our 28,000 
employees for their safety performance 
last year. However, we didn’t meet our 
most important goal: zero employee 
and contractor fatalities. Tragically, one 
employee and two contractors lost their 
lives in work-related vehicle and on-site 
accidents in 2013. And earlier this year 
another two veteran employees died 
while working in the field.

These tragedies are reminders that many 
of our teammates work in hazardous 
environments. Regardless, we must do 
better; injury or death is not a cost of 
doing business. As a company, we’re 
committed to a healthy and injury-
free workplace. We will continue to 
investigate and learn from all safety 
incidents, and we’ll make changes to 
help each employee return home safely 
at the end of the day.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

THE ROAD AHEAD

While we have made many meaningful 
improvements to our environmental 
footprint in recent years, our 
commitment to sustainability means we 
must do a better job of safely managing 
our coal ash ponds. In February 2014, 
ash from one of our North Carolina 
basins was accidentally released into 
the Dan River. We worked around the 
clock to permanently stop the leak. 
Duke Energy, along with various state 
and federal agencies, continues to 
closely monitor the river. Drinking water 
remained safe and river water quality 
has returned to pre-event levels.

In the weeks that followed the incident, 
we initiated a near-term engineering 
review of all our ash basins to detect and 
address potential risks. Moving forward, 
we will work with our state and federal 
stakeholders as we update our long-
term, comprehensive ash management 
strategy – a plan that protects the 
environment and lays the groundwork 
for continued safe, reliable and cost-
effective electricity for our customers. 

Now more than ever, we must operate 
with a great sense of focus and urgency. 

In the end, we believe responsible, 
forward-looking actions will lead to 
continued long-term success for  
Duke Energy.

We know we will be measured by 
financial results as well as by our ability 
to keep our prices competitive, restore 
power after a storm and reduce our 
environmental footprint – just to name  
a few. Balancing these competing 
priorities is a challenge, and often 
requires difficult trade-offs. Regardless, 
we remain focused on the road ahead 
to benefit our customers, communities, 
employees and investors.

Sincerely,

Lynn J. Good 
Vice Chairman, President and  
Chief Executive Officer

energy efficiency products and services 
to choose from.

Included in the Shared Savings plan 
is the new Residential Neighborhood 
Program. Launched in 2013, it offers 
information and energy-saving tools 
to customers in the Carolinas, Ohio 
and Kentucky who live in low-income 
neighborhoods. More than 3,660 
customers have received energy 
efficiency improvements since the 
program’s launch. The Residential 
Neighborhood Program joins 
Neighborhood Energy Saver, a similar 
program available to customers in Florida  
and the Duke Energy Progress territories.

Replacing inefficient light bulbs 
continues to be a popular way to 
save energy and money plus benefit 
the environment. Since 2009, Duke 
Energy has distributed nearly 46 million 
energy-efficient light bulbs throughout 
our service areas. That’s enough energy 
saved to power nearly 144,000 homes 
and offset the carbon output of 266,000 
passenger cars. From the comfort and 
convenience of home, customers in 
select service areas can now shop 
online for highly discounted compact 
fluorescent light (CFL) and light-emitting 
diode (LED) bulbs through the new 
Duke Energy Savings Store.

That old refrigerator in your garage might 
be among your biggest energy wasters. 
Encouraging Duke Energy customers 
to recycle old, secondary refrigerators 
and freezers is one of the ways we’re 
promoting energy efficiency.

In 2013, Duke Energy recycled 25,719 
inefficient refrigerators and freezers 
through its appliance recycling programs. 
Almost 26 million kWh of energy were 
saved last year alone. That’s enough to 
power nearly 2,100 homes.

Appliance recycling is one of 20-plus 
energy efficiency and demand response 
programs offered by Duke Energy 
Carolinas under our new Shared Savings 
plan. The plan not only helps the 
environment, it rewards the company 
for helping customers save energy 
and money. 

In January 2014, the Shared Savings 
plan replaced the save-a-watt program 
in the Duke Energy Carolinas service 
area as the company’s model to recover 
costs associated with these programs. 
This same model is also used in Ohio, 
Kentucky and Duke Energy Progress 
service areas in the Carolinas. Although 
the model is different, our customers in 
Indiana also have access to a suite of 

DUKE ENERGY l 8

Duke Energy’s business and institutional 
customers also benefit from a suite of 
energy saving programs. For example, 
our demand response programs reward 
businesses for curtailing energy usage. 
They can also receive cash incentives for 
installing high-efficiency lighting, HVAC 
systems and other qualifying equipment. 
Outdoor LED lighting solutions are 
also available. We offer complete LED 
solutions, including design selection, 
installation, maintenance and  
24/7 support.

These are just some of the products 
and services that deliver energy savings 
and value to our customers. More 
information about programs available  
to business and residential customers  
is available in the “Save Energy & 
Money” section of duke-energy.com.

REACHING AGREEMENT ON 
AFFORDABLE RATES  

Duke Energy’s electric rates remained 
competitive both nationally and 
regionally in 2013, even as rate 
increases were approved to pay for  
new facilities and infrastructure in  
three of the six states.

Duke Energy has invested billions of 
dollars to upgrade its infrastructure, 
including construction of new advanced-

Source: Edison Electric Institute Typical Bills and Average Rates Reports, Summer 2013 (latest available). The effective date of the base rate increases for Duke Energy Carolinas (North 
Carolina and South Carolina) occurred after July 1, 2013, therefore the source does not reflect these 2013 rate cases which increased rates on average in the first year by 4.5% and 5.5%, 
respectively. Residential rates are based on 1,000 kWh per month usage. Commercial rates are based on 40 kilowatt (kW) demand and 14,000 kWh per month usage. Industrial rates are 
based on 1,000 kW demand and 400,000 kWh per month usage.

existing plants to meet increasingly strict 
environmental and nuclear security 
requirements, and modernization of our 
electric grid. Older, less efficient coal 
plants, many of which were built in the 
1940s, have been replaced with state-
of-the-art power plants that are cleaner 
and more efficient.

To recover the costs incurred in 
upgrading our infrastructure, Duke 

Energy received regulatory approval to 
increase base rates, see table below. 

The Public Utilities Commission of  
Ohio also approved Duke Energy’s 
natural gas distribution case, along  
with the recovery of $56 million 
in costs. This money was spent 
to comply with state and federal 
environmental laws affecting the 
remediation of the company’s former 
manufactured natural gas plant sites.

A BETTER GRID FOR TOMORROW

Duke Energy has invested more than 
$1 billion in digital grid technologies to 
improve our ability to meet customer 
electricity demand.

While upgraded meters get a lot of 
attention, grid modernization also 
includes technologies such as automated 
regulators and circuit breakers to bolster 
performance and reliability. These and 
other devices create a communications 
network across the grid that gives our 
operators more precise data – and 
delivers better service to our customers, 
such as fewer outages and improved 
outage response time.

In 2008, Duke Energy Ohio received 
regulatory approval to begin installing 
smart meters that eliminate the need 
for manual meter reading. In 2013, 
the company installed our 1 millionth 
upgraded meter in the state. Combined 
with other system enhancements,

LIGHTING THE WAY
Getting Customers The Right Help

With arctic cold snaps and summer heat waves, energy use can vary greatly from month to month. 
Sometimes, customers have questions about their bills and whether they’re really using that much electricity.

That’s where Adrianna Morales comes in. As one of our customer service team leaders in Raleigh,  
North Carolina, Morales puts her people skills to work each day – listening, explaining and providing 
guidance to customers who are concerned about their energy bill.

“Often times, it’s showing customers the many tools available to help them,” said Morales, who serves both 
English- and Spanish-speaking customers. “It’s a good opportunity to educate them on how their energy 
habits are affecting their bill. In some cases, it’s just listening to the customer.”

There is no “one size fits all” response. Morales said that only by talking and listening can she steer 
customers in the right direction. She helps customers better understand their electric usage and the steps 
they can take to be more energy efficient on a daily basis.

TRANSPORTATION FUEL CHOICE 

and information on consumer  
charging behaviors. 

With the rapidly growing plug-in electric 
vehicle (PEV) market, Duke Energy is 
preparing to support our customers and 
maintain a safe, reliable electric grid.

Over the next year, the company expects 
to double the number of PEVs in our 
transportation fleet as larger and more 
utility-capable trucks become available.

During the past year, we worked 
closely with many stakeholder groups 
to help them achieve “plug-in ready” 
communities. We also became a 
founding partner in the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s workplace charging initiative.

Duke Energy is in the final phase of 
one of the largest utility charging station 
research programs in the country.  
More than 650 charging stations  
have been deployed, and the company 
is collecting installation “best practices”

GROWING SOLAR IN AMERICA’S 
STRONGEST MARKETS

Duke Energy Renewables has invested 
in two of America’s strongest solar 
markets, California and North Carolina, 
adding 65 MW of solar capacity in 2013 
– making us one of the largest solar 
producers in the United States. 

With its abundant sunshine and 
renewable energy mandate, California 
leads the nation in solar power capacity. 
Duke Energy Renewables capitalized on 
the Golden State’s growth opportunities, 
acquiring the 21-MW Highlander Solar 
Power Project, our largest solar site to 
date. In eastern North Carolina, we 
built five solar power projects – three 
in Dominion’s North Carolina territory 
and two for the North Carolina Eastern 
Municipal Power Agency.

customers have avoided more than 
about 9 million outage minutes since  
the program began and now have tools 
they can use to better manage their 
energy usage. 

In other areas including the Carolinas, 
many of our customers already have 
meters that can be read remotely and 
system modernization is playing a 
significant role in helping us manage 
demands on the grid, particularly during 
extreme weather events.

A modernized grid is also better 
prepared for the growth of distributed 
forms of generation such as solar and 
wind, whose output can fluctuate based 
on the time of day and weather.

As we modernize our grid to better serve 
customers, we continually assess and 
improve our practices to keep pace with 
data privacy and cybersecurity threats. 
It is imperative we maintain the trust of 
those we serve. That is why we keep all 
of our customer information confidential. 

Duke Energy will continue to research 
and implement new grid technologies 
that can improve the grid for generations 
to come. It all goes back to ensuring 
the company delivers the most value 
to our customers for the technology 
investments we make.

Reliability Is A Priority

Delivering reliable power is a high priority for Duke Energy. Our outage statistics show a long-term 
trend of improving reliability both in the number and duration of outages. 

To keep the trend moving in a positive direction, we identify locations on our system where we can 
make improvements to prevent outages. We also learn from weather events, which can have a big 
impact, and work to improve our responses to outages. Our ongoing focus is to take cost-effective 
actions to improve reliability, while keeping rates low.

Generation Reliability
Reliable service also requires a dependable fleet of power plants and each year we set aggressive 
goals to help drive their continuous reliability improvement. Our nuclear fleet’s capacity factor, 
which is a measure of generation reliability, improved from 90.4 percent in 2012 to 92.8 percent in 
2013, and exceeded 90 percent for the 15th consecutive year. 

Although the regulated fossil fleet performed when needed to meet our customers’ demand, it did 
not meet its aggressive 2013 reliability goal of 87.9 percent commercial availability.  

The nonregulated fossil and renewables fleets had another good year of commercial availability and 
renewables yield above 90 percent, with a 91.9 percent result for 2013.

WIND POWER UNDER CONSTRUCTION

After a year of heavy construction in 
2012, when Duke Energy Renewables 
added five wind projects with more than 
600 MW of capacity to our portfolio, the 
company focused on developing new 
opportunities in 2013. We announced 
two 200-MW South Texas wind power 
projects, Los Vientos III and IV, which 
are under construction and expected to 
be completed within two years.  

Our wind project additions mean we are 
among the top 10 wind power producers 
in the country.

LIGHTING THE WAY
Indiana Shoppers Get Plugged In

Solar power, battery storage and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) all converge 
at Clay Terrace Mall in Carmel, Indiana, thanks to a project developed by Duke 
Energy’s Emerging Technology team.

The innovative system offers both traditional and quick-charge stations for PEVs 
– connecting to a 10-kW roof-mounted solar panel. The solar energy is stored in a 
42-kWh lithium-ion battery, which could be helpful during times of peak demand. 

Thanks to abundant sunshine, shoppers can charge their PEVs for free at the mall. 
Every year, the system generates more than 10,000 kWh of solar energy. That’s 
enough to power an electric car for about 43,000 miles.

The project works this way: The solar panels turn sunshine into electric energy, 
which is stored in the battery. When the battery is fully charged, it sends any 
extra solar energy directly to the local power grid. When a PEV is plugged into one 
of the vehicle chargers, it gets charged from the local power grid and the battery 
simultaneously releases that same amount of solar energy to the grid. 

But the system is not just a test site. It’s a real-world application that allows 
shoppers to experience and learn about the technology firsthand – while charging 
their cars using renewable energy.

For Duke Energy, the installation provides a valuable model for how renewable 
energy can be aligned with advanced storage technologies to provide a practical 
power source for the future.

MIGRATORY BIRD  
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

In November 2013, Duke Energy 
Renewables reached a settlement 
agreement with the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DOJ) regarding the deaths of 
golden eagles and other migratory birds 
at its Top of the World and Campbell Hill 
wind power projects in Wyoming.

The DOJ brought misdemeanor charges 
under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
(MBTA) for 14 golden eagle fatalities  
that occurred over a three-year period. 
Golden eagles are not listed as 
threatened or endangered under U.S. 
law, but are protected under the MBTA. 
The company agreed to federal fines  
and restitution of $1 million, which 
included ongoing mitigation  
investments and contributions to  
wildlife conservation groups. 

Duke Energy Renewables is working 
closely with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service on a formal eagle conservation 
plan to supplement its already rigorous 
avian protection program. The company 
had comprehensive measures in place 
prior to the settlement to safeguard 
wildlife and protect birds, including radar 
technology, presence of biologists at 
sites and a turbine curtailment program. 
Duke Energy Renewables’ goal is to 

provide the benefits of wind energy in 
the most environmentally responsible 
way possible, leading the industry in 
implementing technologies to minimize 
avian impacts at its wind sites.

REGULATED RENEWABLES ON  
THE FAST TRACK

Given that the cost of renewable 
generation is declining, don’t be 
surprised to see more of it in Duke 
Energy’s regulated service territories.

In 2013, the company formed the 
Renewable Generation Development 
organization to focus on adding cost-
effective renewables throughout the  
six states we serve.

Three of these states the company 
serves have either mandatory or 
voluntary renewable portfolio  
standards for such sources as wind, 
solar, biomass and energy efficiency.

Duke Energy is already a leader in 
providing renewables to its customers. 
In 2013, the Solar Electric Power 
Association ranked the company eighth 
among utility companies for buying solar 
power for customers.

In North Carolina, the company won 
approval of its Green Source Rider, 
which allows certain large customers the

option of offsetting some or all of their 
energy consumption from new load – 
such as a new or expanded facility –  
with renewable energy. Under the 
program, the company will purchase or 
produce renewable energy to meet the 
new demand – without the additional 
costs affecting other customers.

In South Carolina, the company helps 
fund a program through Palmetto Clean 
Energy that is backing solar installations 
at five schools in the state. 

In Florida, the company committed 
more than $5 million in 2014 under its 
SunSense solar program. This includes 
$3.2 million in rebates for residential 
and commercial solar installations and

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: ALWAYS 
SEEKING IMPROVEMENTS

Duke Energy uses a number of internal 
and external benchmark studies to 
compare customer satisfaction progress 
from year to year – and against  
other utilities.

Business customers: Large business 
customers continue to give Duke Energy 
high marks for the service they receive, 
with more than 80 percent ‘highly 
satisfied’ with Duke Energy as their 
electricity provider.

Overall satisfaction scores improved 
for all four Duke Energy operating 
companies in the 2014 J.D. Power 
and Associates Electric Utility Business 
Customer Satisfaction StudySM.

   Duke Energy Carolinas was up  

4 points to a score of 666, which 
placed it in the second quartile 
nationally among all large utilities.

   Duke Energy Midwest was the biggest 
mover, up 28 points to 666 and in 
the second quartile nationally. 

   Duke Energy Progress was up  

3 points to 664.

   Duke Energy Florida was up 10 points 
to 655, its highest score in more than 
six years.

Customer satisfaction drivers:  
Several factors contributed to declines  
in customer satisfaction scores:

This study judged companies on six 
factors: power quality and reliability, 
billing and payment, corporate 
citizenship, price, communications  
and customer service.

Residential customers: Overall 
satisfaction scores were mixed across 
the four Duke Energy operating 
companies in the 2013 J.D. Power and 
Associates Electric Utility Residential 
Customer Satisfaction StudySM.

   Duke Energy Carolinas was up  

19 points to 656, tying its highest 
score in four years and placing it in 
the second quartile nationally among 
all large utilities.

   Duke Energy Progress was down  
10 points to 640, placing it in the 
second quartile nationally.

   Duke Energy Midwest was down  

6 points to 631, placing it in the third 
quartile nationally.

   Duke Energy Florida continued to 

improve, up 9 points to 620.

The same six factors used to evaluate 
business customers are also used for 
residential customers.

   Increased rates in the Carolinas

communication related to power outages 
– all of which should contribute to higher 
customer satisfaction.

engineering review of all our ash basins 
to identify and address potential risks.

ACTIVE IN LOWERING  
CARBON EMISSIONS

On February 2, 2014, a break in a 
stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at 
the company’s retired Dan River Steam 
Station in North Carolina released coal 
ash and water into the Dan River.

Between 30,000 and 39,000 tons 
of ash, along with 24 to 27 million 
gallons of water, were discharged from 
the basin. For context, the Dan River 
incident was about 1 percent of the total 
ash released during a 2008 dam break 
at another utility’s site in Tennessee. 
Even though the Dan River release was 
much smaller in comparison, it doesn’t 
diminish the importance of the event 
and what the company will learn from it.

Downstream drinking water remained 
safe during the incident and 
environmental monitoring teams from 
multiple agencies and Duke Energy 
continue to track river conditions. 
Duke Energy is doing what’s right to 
address effects to the Dan River and has 
committed that our customers will not 
pay for the cleanup efforts.

We have undertaken a number of 
additional activities since the initial days 
following the ash release, including 
initiating a near-term third-party 

We also formed an internal team that 
is identifying ways to strengthen the 
comprehensive ash management plan 
we’ve had in place for years.

In March 2014, we shared plans with 
North Carolina officials regarding our 
management of coal ash at Dan River 
and across our system. 

We proposed to move ash at three 
retired coal plants, accelerate closure  
at an additional basin, convert to dry fly 
ash handling at all remaining facilities  
in North Carolina and begin dewatering 
the other retired basins.

Of course, implementing these near-term 
recommendations and longer-term plans 
depends on state and federal agreement 
that these are prudent, cost-effective 
and environmentally sound options.

For more than a century, our company 
has provided reliable and affordable 
electricity to our customers. Coal-fired 
power plants produced a good portion 
of that electricity. Throughout that 
time, we have managed our ash basins 
using industry standard technology 
and monitoring practices. We continue 
to place the safe operation of our ash 
basins as one of our highest priorities. 

Duke Energy believes climate change 
policy is an important issue. We are 
committed to working with Congress 
and the administration to develop 
reasonable federal policies that  
would gradually lower greenhouse  
gas emissions, without adversely 
affecting our ability to provide affordable, 
reliable electricity to our more than  
7 million customers.

Congress took no action on climate 
policy in 2013 and is unlikely to 
address it in 2014 because of deep 
political divisions on the issue. In the 
absence of congressional action, the 

“ Conservation organizations 
and individuals can’t work on 
conservation in a vacuum. 
That’s why it is important that 
corporations like Duke Energy 
join with us to achieve our 
conservation mission.”

2013 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT l 15

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) is advancing plans to establish 
regulations to reduce CO2 emissions 
from fossil-fueled power plants. In early 
2014, the EPA proposed a rule that 
would limit CO2 emissions from new 
fossil-fueled power plants, with a final 
rule expected sometime in 2015. The 
EPA is also expected to propose a rule in 
June 2014 that will begin the process of 
regulating CO2 emissions from existing 
power plants.

Duke Energy established voluntary 
carbon reduction goals in 2010. The 
goals – which were updated in the 
company’s 2012 Sustainability Report 
because of the merger between Duke 
Energy and Progress Energy – reflect 
our aspiration to reduce or offset 
the company’s generation fleet CO2 
emissions by 17 percent below their 
2005 level by 2020. Duke Energy’s 2012  
and 2013 CO2 emissions were each 
about 20 percent lower than in 2005.  

Duke Energy has taken a number of 
significant actions that have reduced 
our CO2 emissions, including the 
retirement of old coal-fired power plants 
and the construction of lower CO2 
emitting natural gas power plants. We 
also continue to offer our customers 
a variety of energy efficiency and 
conservation programs to help them

LIGHTING THE WAY
From Alligators To Eagles

Overseeing environmental compliance at Duke Energy Florida’s Hines Energy 
Complex is no easy task. There are traditional responsibilities in maintaining 
compliance with state and federal regulations, but there are also nontraditional 
tasks like keeping alligators and snakes from entering the plant.

That’s right. Alligators and snakes are part of the natural landscape at the Hines 
Plant. On any given day, Environmental Compliance Manager Tommy O’Neal 
might go from checking the pH levels in the cooling pond to relocating an Eastern 
Diamondback snake to a safer area of the property. Don’t worry – he has his 
safety equipment with him.

“Some mornings, I have to go around the site to check on things,” said O’Neal. 
“While I’m out there with a cup of coffee watching the sun come up, I can often 
see eagles catch their morning breakfast. I think my office view is better than the 
CEO’s. Can she say she watches eagles catch fish?”

Nestled on about 8,000 acres of land in Polk County, the Hines Energy Complex is 
home to a wide variety of wildlife. 

Several years ago, the state of Florida estimated that there were about 2,000 
alligators at Hines. It’s very common to see them swimming in the cooling ponds 
where the plant boasts a thriving ecosystem. The warm waters of the cooling 
ponds allow for the algae, tilapia (algae eaters) and alligators (tilapia eaters) to 
grow year-round.

Working closely with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the 
state monitors the alligator population and, when necessary, will remove some 
alligators from the property. And 2,000 alligators can produce a lot of eggs. Last 
year, the commission collected more than 1,000 alligator eggs, which they will 
raise and sell for commercial use.

reduce their electricity consumption in a 
cost-effective manner. There have also 
been market forces – including sluggish 
electricity demand and low natural gas 
prices – which have contributed to our 
lower CO2 emissions relative to 2005.  

Although it is tempting to declare 
success based on 2012 and 2013, 
our current forecasts suggest we will 
experience a gradual increase in CO2 
emissions in the years ahead as the 
economy continues to recover and 
demand increases. Our future CO2 
emissions will continue to be influenced 
largely by fuel prices and customer 
demand. They may also be influenced 
by impending EPA regulations that are

difficult to predict. Duke Energy will 
continue to be actively engaged in the 
development of EPA’s CO2 regulations 
with the focus on outcomes that are in 
the best interest of our customers and 
shareholders. We will also continue to 
reassess our carbon reduction goals as 
new CO2 standards are developed.  

MORE CLEAN PLANTS  
SERVE CUSTOMERS

Several new plants and the retirement 
of older, less efficient ones in 2013 
advanced the company’s continuing 
efforts to modernize our fossil fleet with 
cleaner generation.

The 618-MW advanced gasification 
Edwardsport Generating Station in Knox 
County, Indiana, is one of the cleanest 
coal plants in the world. The technology 
gasifies coal, removes pollutants and 
then burns the cleaner gas to generate 
electricity. This is the first time this 
technology has been used on this scale. 
The station will continue to ramp up to 
its long-term level of availability during 
2014 and will serve customers for 
decades to come with dramatically  
fewer emissions. Sulfur dioxide, for 
example, is about 10 percent of the 
federal standard for new sources.

The 625-MW natural gas Sutton 
Combined Cycle Plant in Wilmington, 
North Carolina, began commercial 
operation in late 2013, allowing for the 
simultaneous retirement of 575 MW  
of older, less efficient coal generation  
at the same site.

Other retirements in 2013 included the 
454-MW Riverbend Steam Station and 
the two remaining coal units (256 MW) 
at the Buck Steam Station, both in North 
Carolina. Units 2 and 3 (222 MW) at 
the Beckjord Generating Station in New 
Richmond, Ohio, were retired in 2013, 
and unit 4 (150 MW) was retired in 
early 2014.

The company announced plans to build 
two additional natural gas plants to 
meet customer demand in the coming 
years. We are moving forward with 
the permitting required for a potential 
750-MW combined cycle plant in 
Anderson County, South Carolina. We 
also are evaluating proposals to provide 
1,640 MW of generation in Citrus 
County, Florida, by 2018, which will 
allow us to retire older coal units nearby. 

The merger of Duke Energy and 
Progress Energy has allowed for the 
joint dispatch of Carolinas generation. 
Through this joint dispatching 
and increased fuel flexibility, the 

DUKE ENERGY l 16

company saved customers more than 
$190 million through the end of 2013. 
Increased fuel flexibility at Carolinas 
plants also reduces reliance on coal 
potentially mined through mountaintop 
removal methods.

NUCLEAR: PRESENT AND FUTURE

Throughout 2013, Duke Energy’s 
nuclear fleet consistently delivered 
clean, safe, reliable energy to customers 
– whether it was during a record heat 
wave or arctic cold snap.

Operating at six sites, the company’s  
11 reactors maintained a capacity  
factor of 92.8 percent. That marked  
the 15th straight year the combined  
fleet achieved a mark greater than  
90 percent.

Catawba unit 1 and the Oconee Nuclear 
Station – both in South Carolina – set 
all-time capacity factor records during 
the year. Robinson Nuclear Plant and 
Oconee units 2 and 3, all in South 
Carolina, completed record runs of 
531, 552 and 504 consecutive days, 
respectively.

The fleet also cut workplace injuries in 
half from the previous year (23 versus 
46 in 2012).

To meet future electricity demands, 
Duke Energy continues to pursue a 
construction and operating license 
(COL) for the Lee Nuclear Station in 
Cherokee County, South Carolina, and 
the Levy County Nuclear Station in Levy 
County, Florida. Both sites feature two 
Westinghouse AP1000 pressurized 
water reactors – one of the safest 
and most economical nuclear power 
technologies available in the worldwide 
commercial market.

In early 2013, the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) notified the  
company that the schedule for issuing 
Lee’s COL has been moved to the 
second quarter of 2016 – a three-year 
delay. The NRC cited, in part, budgetary 
and resource constraints on new reactor 
licensing activities.

Later in the year, the company received 
the Final Environmental Impact Study 
from the NRC, completing a major 
milestone toward obtaining the COL. 
The Levy COL is expected in mid-2015.

DECOMMISSIONING PLANS  
UNDERWAY AT CRYSTAL RIVER 
NUCLEAR PLANT

Since making the tough decision in 
February 2013 to retire the Crystal River 
Nuclear Plant, known as CR3, plant 

leaders and employees have made 
significant progress. 

During 2013, the CR3 team focused 
on helping employees through the 
transition, developing a decommissioning 
plan and submitting various required 
documents to the NRC. Of the 600 
full-time employees, about 260 remain 
on site as part of the Decommissioning 
Transition group, and more than 230 
employees have successfully redeployed 
to other positions within the company. 
About 100 employees left the company 
with severance benefits.

In 2014, the team will implement 
tasks outlined in its comprehensive 
decommissioning plan. Some of the 
plan’s highlights include:

   Duke Energy has selected an NRC-

approved decommissioning option in 
which the plant will remain in a safe, 
stable condition for 60 years until 
crews complete decommissioning 
work in 2074.

   The estimated decommissioning cost 

is $1.18 billion in today’s dollars. 
Duke Energy believes the company’s 
existing nuclear decommissioning 
trust fund – including future growth of 
the fund and funds from the plant’s 
nine other owners – will be sufficient 
to decommission the plant. The fund

Lake Norman 
Celebrates 50 Years

When it comes to regional impact, it’s 
difficult to top the Cowans Ford Hydro Station 
near Charlotte, North Carolina. 

Celebrating 50 years of operation in 2013, the 
Duke Energy station created the largest man-
made lake in North Carolina: Lake Norman.

Located in a vibrant area of the region, 
Lake Norman is a source of water for 
power generation, drinking water and 
wildlife habitat. It also provides a variety 
of recreational activities for about 3 million 
people each year. The lake has 520 miles of 
shoreline and covers 50 square miles.

was valued at $753 million as of 
December 31, 2013. 

   Radiological and environmental 
monitoring will continue during  
the entire decommissioning  
process to ensure safety and 
environmental protection. 

   The plant’s used nuclear fuel will 

remain in the existing on-site fuel pool 
until a new, on-site, dry-cask storage 
facility is built. The plant has safely 
stored its used fuel on site since the 
facility’s first refueling in 1978.

USING WATER AND IMPROVING IT

Water is a vital part of Duke Energy’s 
power plant operations. 

   It is harnessed to flow through our 

48 conventional hydroelectric power 
plants and two pumped-storage 
hydroelectric facilities. 

   It is heated into steam to turn turbines 
in our fossil-fueled and nuclear plants, 
then cooled, recycled and used again.

   It is also an integral part of the 
equipment we use to control air 
emissions at our fossil stations.

Now Duke Energy is looking at ways  
to improve the water quality around  
our facilities.

In the Midwest, an innovative program 
is underway to improve the water in 
the Ohio River system – home to five 
of the company’s large power plants. If 
successful, it can serve as a model for 
other regions of the country.

The Ohio River Water Quality Trading 
Project is a market-based approach that 
will allow utilities, cities and farmers the 
ability to lower the amount of overall 
nutrients – compounds of phosphorus 
and nitrogen in particular – entering the 
Ohio River system.

Much like the allowance trading system 
under the Clean Air Act, the project 
allows stakeholders the ability to buy 
and sell nutrient credits. Facilities 
that reduce their nutrient discharges 
voluntarily will be able to sell credits to 
other entities.

This trading system will allow 
stakeholders the flexibility to make 
improvements at their own facilities, 
or buy credits to pay for improvements 
made by other stakeholders.

The end result will be improved water 
quality for all.

The project is spearheaded by the 
Electric Power Research Institute,  
with financial support from the 
Environmental Protection Agency,  
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Duke Energy and other utilities.

In March 2014, stakeholders gathered 
for the official kickoff. The trading 
system will be voluntary, but as 
regulators look for compliance methods 
to lower nutrient discharges, we hope 
this type of market-based program  
will be considered for both its economic 
and environmental benefits.

Fuels consumed for  
U.S. electric generation
Compared to 2008, coal consumption 
decreased by about one-third, and oil 
consumption decreased to less than one-fifth 
of 2008 volumes. Natural gas consumption 
tripled in that same time period, mostly 
because natural gas became a relatively less 
expensive fuel and we added natural gas 
generation capacity.

Water withdrawn and consumed
Water withdrawn is the total volume removed 
from a water source, such as a lake or a river. 
Because of once-through cooling systems on 
many of our coal-fired and nuclear plants, 
about 98 percent of this water is returned to 
the source and available for other uses. Water 
consumed is the amount of water removed for 
use and not returned to the source.

Emissions from generation
Emission levels and intensities depend on 
many factors, including generation diversity 
and efficiency, demand for electricity, weather, 
fuel availability and prices, and emission 
controls deployed. Since 2005, our U.S. CO2 
emissions decreased by 20%, sulfur dioxide 
(SO2) emissions decreased by 84% and 
nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions decreased by 
63%. These decreases are primarily because 
of decreased coal generation, increased 
natural gas generation, and replacement 
of higher-emitting plants. In addition, Duke 
Energy and Progress Energy have invested 
more than $7 billion in SO2 and NOX emission 
controls since 1999. (There is currently 
no demonstrated, commercially available 
technology to control CO2 emissions.) Our 
current forecasts suggest upward pressure 
on our CO2 emissions in the years ahead. This 
will challenge our ability to meet our 2020 
emission reduction goals.

SAFETY: RECORD-SETTING YEAR,  
BUT THE GOAL IS ALWAYS ZERO

Safety is central to everything we do  
at Duke Energy. We put safety first  
in our workplaces and communities,  
and our goal is to achieve a zero- 
injury culture.

We had many successes in 2013. 
We finished the year with the lowest 
total injury rate in our history. And we 
reduced serious injuries by more than 
30 percent.

Sadly, three of our co-workers lost 
their lives last year – two contractors 
and one employee. In early 2014, we 
experienced another two employee 
fatalities. These and other events that 
resulted in serious injuries are bitter 
reminders that we can never be satisfied 
until everyone goes home safely at the 
end of the workday.

We will accomplish this goal 
by thoroughly investigating and 
understanding why failures occur. 
We will learn from those experiences 
and determine how to improve flawed 
systems and processes to better detect

LIGHTING THE WAY
From Intern To Full-Time Employee

Many Duke Energy employees began their careers with the company as interns. In 2013 alone, 100 co-op 
students and 200 interns were hired from around the service territory.

Some of these students become full-time employees. That’s what happened with Andrew Johansing of 
Cincinnati, Danielle Peoples, Justin LaRoche and Danielle Anderson of Charlotte. These former interns now 
work at Duke Energy and are also members of our Sustainability Corps.

Anderson was going to college at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte when she applied for a paid 
internship with the company in 2008. Her summer tenure at the Little Rock Operations Center in Charlotte 
was the start of Anderson’s Duke Energy career.

By fall 2009, Anderson was working at Duke Energy part time while completing her civil engineering degree. 
On June 1, 2010, she joined the company full time. Today, she’s part of our Smart Energy Now™ team, 
promoting sustainable behaviors that will drive energy efficiency in commercial office buildings.

“My internship gave me valuable insight into the company and increased my competitiveness as I entered 
the workforce,” she said.

Duke Energy’s internship and co-op programs are critical components of the company’s strategic sourcing 
plan for potential talent. These paid programs are mutually beneficial to the company and to talented 
college students.

Duke Energy managers are able to evaluate individuals for full-time employment. Those that join the 
company begin their careers well-prepared to assume high-value positions.

LIGHTING THE WAY
Celebrating Our Differences 

Patience and friendliness come naturally to Felix Del Rosario, making him an expert at helping customers 
resolve complicated problems. Felix joined Duke Energy in 2003, and says he’s “enjoyed every minute of it.”

Although he’s lived in North Carolina for years, Felix was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. His 
ability to communicate fluently with both English- and Spanish-speaking customers, addressing complex 
situations with distinct cultural and linguistic nuances, is invaluable.

Using our differences to help customers isn’t new to Duke Energy. The company has a number of employee 
resource groups to strengthen the bond between employees – recognizing our employees are a pretty 
diverse group, too.

In the past, Del Rosario served as the president of Duke Energy’s Latinos Energizing Diversity @ Duke, or 
L.E.D. He now serves as an adviser to the group. “It’s important that we can come together as employees 
and celebrate our diversity as a company,” he said. “The company’s employee resource groups are a great 
way to build on how we are different, but we all share a common goal of making the company successful.”

need to educate and train students in 
these fields. Through these educators’ 
impact, the program could potentially 
reach 100,000 students over a  
three-year period. 

In Florida, Duke Energy partnered with 
the University of Florida (UF) on its 
Successful Transition through Enhanced 
Preparation for Undergraduate Program 
(STEP-UP), which aims to educate and 
develop students from backgrounds that 
are underrepresented in engineering. 
The program augments the UF College 
of Engineering’s focus on engineering 
recruiting, retention and increased 
diversity and inclusion.

In Indiana, Duke Energy teamed up 
with key community and business 
stakeholders to work toward closing 

Indiana’s skills gap and get Indiana 
residents working again. Duke Energy 
invested $312,000 to create 120 
scholarships for training programs aimed 
at developing critical manufacturing 
skills. This investment will strengthen 
Indiana’s economic vitality, and increase 
the overall quality of life of those in  
our communities.

A slightly younger workforce: Just 
over half of our current workforce 
is made up of “baby boomers” and 
“traditionalists,” who are nearing 
retirement in the next decade or so – 
down from more than 60 percent in 
2011. In 2013, “Generation X”  
exceeded one-third and “millennials” 
exceeded 10 percent of the workforce  
for the first time. 

Our workforce planning efforts are 
paying off, as we recruit new hires 
and work to ensure a full pipeline of 
employees with the right qualifications 
and skills. We will continue to monitor 
the company’s demographics, and 
forecast areas where more qualified 
employees are needed.

Duke Energy works to make a difference

company supports numerous economic 
development organizations across our 
six-state service territory. From Florida to

A TRADITION OF GIVING BACK

Giving back is another way Duke 
Energy helps build strong communities. 
Combined charitable giving in 2013 
was about $73 million. That support 
includes funding from the Duke Energy 
Foundation, company donations, 

employee and retiree gifts, and the value 
of volunteer hours.

The Duke Energy Foundation reviews 
funding requests at the regional level 
and targets investments in areas where 
it believes the company can have the 
greatest impact on the well-being of 
our communities – the environment, 
economic development, education and 
community vitality.

Boy Scout Program At Nuclear Plants

For nearly 30 years, energy and environmental science experts at McGuire Nuclear Station have 
enthusiastically shared their knowledge with young people through participation in the Boy Scouts of 
America merit badge program.

The program, which started with 90 scouts at the first encampment at McGuire in 1987, has seen 
tremendous growth – welcoming nearly 550 young men every year to earn merit badges. 

In addition to earning merit badges, Boy Scouts at McGuire and Catawba nuclear stations participate in 
multiday events and have the chance to pitch a tent and camp out under the stars on the grounds of the 
power plant or at a nearby campsite.

At Oconee Nuclear Station, scouts participate in a Merit Badge College where they can earn up to four  
merit badges in one day. Between the three nuclear stations, more than 850 Boy Scouts earn merit  
badges annually.  

Undoubtedly, a big part of the program’s success can be attributed to Duke Energy employees – like Reggie 
Morehead – who have volunteered as instructors, including scientists, engineers, plant operators and 
trainers, since the start of the program. At McGuire, more than 150 employees have volunteered since the 
encampment began.

Each year, Duke Energy and the Boy Scouts continue to work together to find fun and innovative ways to 
enhance science education for young boys. While scouts leave full of knowledge, events like the merit badge 
program are another way we share the benefits of nuclear power as a safe and reliable energy source.

LENDING A HAND … EVERYWHERE

Employee and retiree involvement 
have been a hallmark of Duke Energy 
for more than 100 years. In fact, you 
never know where you’ll see employees 
making a difference.

Many times working under the banner 
“Duke Energy In Action,” employees 
and retirees volunteer for projects – 
large and small – throughout the year. 
Whether working on a Habitat for 
Humanity house in South Carolina, or 
sorting school supplies for students at 
Classroom Central in Charlotte, North 
Carolina, volunteerism is wired into the 
company’s DNA.

In Florida, our disABILITY Outreach 
and Inclusion Team (DO-IT!) obtained 
grant money from the Duke Energy 
Foundation to fund the renovation 
of PARC-FL’s Adult Technology 
Achievement Center.

PARC-FL is a nonprofit organization –  
providing children and adults with 
developmental disabilities the tools and 
knowledge needed to exercise their 
independence and experience life to  
the fullest.

The Duke Energy Foundation also offers 
employees two types of volunteer grants:

   Community improvement grants, 

used to purchase supplies for “sweat 
equity” volunteer projects 

   Leadership grants for employees who 

serve on nonprofit boards 

“ Duke Energy has 
demonstrated its commitment 
to community sustainability 
through its Urban 
Revitalization Initiative – 
creating jobs, eliminating 
blight, bringing vacant and 
underutilized buildings 
back to life and retaining 
existing businesses. Duke’s 
leadership is making a major 
contribution to the economic 
competitiveness of the Greater 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky 
region.”

This center is used by PARC-FL clients 
daily. The DO-IT! group partnered 
with a local home improvement store 
and flooring contractor to include new 
flooring and windows in the renovation. 

Almost 20 DO-IT! employees tirelessly 
worked in shifts painting and installing 
insulation, ceiling tiles and new telecom  
cabling. The group also put in new 
outdoor benches and upgraded chairs  
and bathroom fixtures to meet Americans  
with Disabilities Act standards.

This is just one of the company’s many 
volunteer projects. They vary in location 
and in scope, but to those involved – 
there’s nothing bigger.

LIGHTING THE WAY
Help For Our Urban Core

For Rhonda Whitaker, economic development isn’t just about acres of land and large manufacturing 
facilities. The Government and Community Relations manager realized the company’s Cincinnati and 
Northern Kentucky areas were primed for urban redevelopment.

“The company’s urban core has different challenges and opportunities than our suburban or rural areas,” 
she said. “If we allow these urban areas to deteriorate, we end up potentially hurting economic development 
in other areas.”

For the past three years, Duke Energy Ohio/Duke Energy Kentucky has overseen the Urban Revitalization 
Initiative – funded by the Duke Energy Foundation. The initiative has funneled more than $700,000 to 19 
different projects. These funds serve as a catalyst to help redevelop and reinvent the heartbeat of urban 
communities across the region.

The goal is to sustain the core of Duke Energy’s urban communities, reduce blight in neighborhoods and 
produce something new out of something old – while spurring job creation or retention.

“Our interest is in projects that have real momentum and will become a reality,” Whitaker said. “We want to 
target those projects that can have the greatest impact.

A panel of a dozen urban redevelopment experts help the company pinpoint where Duke Energy can best 
use its money. Whitaker said a combination of private and public funds is needed to get most projects off 
the ground.

“When a project comes together, and you helped make it happen – it’s rewarding to know that our funding 
played a role,” she said.

FINANCIAL STRENGTH CONTINUES TO 
SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

In 2013, the company achieved 
adjusted diluted earnings per share of 
$4.35, which was in the mid-point of 
the company’s $4.25 to $4.45 earnings 
guidance to Wall Street.

Those financial results reflect a full 
year of earnings from Progress Energy 
resulting from our merger in July 2012, 

and customer rate increases to recover 
our investments in cleaner power plants 
and digital power delivery systems.

Delivering attractive returns for our 
investors is one of our primary goals  
as a sustainable company. Toward  
that aim, we increased our quarterly 
dividend by about 2 percent in 2013, 
the 87th consecutive year Duke Energy 
has paid a quarterly dividend on its 
common stock.

2  On July 2, 2012, immediately prior to the merger with Progress Energy, Duke Energy executed a one-for-three reverse 
stock split. All share and earnings-per-share amounts are presented as if the one-for-three reverse stock split had 
been effective at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Our total shareholder return – the 
change in stock price plus dividends –  
for 2013 was approximately 13 percent. 
This outperformed the 11.0 percent 
return of the Philadelphia Utility Index 
(20 U.S. utilities) during the same 
period. The S&P 500’s total shareholder 
return of 32.4 percent for 2013 was its 
best year since 1997. 

Duke Energy remains well-positioned 
to achieve long-term average annual 
growth in adjusted diluted earnings per 
share of between 4 to 6 percent from 
a 2013 base (the first full year for the 
merged company) through 2016.

REALIZING MERGER BENEFITS FOR 
CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS

Our fuel and joint generation 
dispatch savings were important 
accomplishments for Duke Energy in 
2013. Our joint dispatch agreement 
allows Duke Energy Carolinas and 
Duke Energy Progress to share power 
from plants across the Carolinas. This 
enables us to run the most efficient 
plants available from our combined 
generation fleet in order to meet the 
total demand on both systems at the 
least cost. Through December 31, 
2013, we exceeded our original targets 
and have recorded about $190 million 
of cumulative fuel and joint dispatch

since the merger closed.

A CULTURE OF HIGH  
ETHICAL STANDARDS

We have contractually locked-in or 
generated about 65 percent of the total 
guaranteed savings of $687 million over 
the first five years of the merger.

Utilities are governed by a complex 
web of laws and regulations – making 
them one of the most heavily regulated 
industries in the U.S.

The efficiencies we gain from fuel and 
joint dispatch help us mitigate future rate 
increases as we reinvest in the business 
for the future to replace aging power 
plants, modernize our grid, and scale up 
renewable energy.

DECISION ON MIDWEST  
COMMERCIAL GENERATION

In February 2014, the company began a 
process to exit our Midwest commercial 
generation business, which includes 
ownership interest in 13 power plants 
with a total capacity of about 6,600 
MW. Although the plants are equipped 
with significant environmental controls 
and are competitive in the market, their 
financial returns have been volatile and 
not a good long-term strategic fit for  
the company.

We will continue to safely operate these 
plants during this process, which we 
expect will take up to 12 to 18 months. 
Our regulated utilities in the Midwest are 
not part of the exit process. 

Many stakeholder groups pay close 
attention to what Duke Energy does: 
regulators, public officials, community 
leaders, customers, investors, advocacy 
groups and the news media.

We have three corporate codes that 
foster a culture of ethics and compliance 
at Duke Energy, from the Board of 
Directors to every employee, contract 
worker and supplier:

   Code of Business Ethics

   Supplier Code of Conduct

   Board of Directors Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics

Duke Energy ensures compliance with 
the Code of Business Ethics through 
required annual employee training, 
systematic monitoring and, when 
necessary, enforcement. In addition, 
we consider compatibility with our 
performance culture and expected 
behaviors when hiring, and new 
employees receive ethics training once 
on the job.

The company expects leaders at all 
levels to set an ethical tone, and to 
maintain an “open door” policy for 
employees to report concerns. Ethics 
leadership training helps managers and 
supervisors foster a culture of trust and 
accountability in their workgroups.

Additionally, the company provides 
anonymous channels for employees 
to seek guidance or report concerns 
regarding any illegal or unethical 
behavior without fear of retaliation,  
and solicits employee feedback on 
company and department ethics  
through annual surveys.

To learn more about our ethics 
programs, please visit duke-energy.com.

ENGAGED IN POLITICAL PARTICIPATION

Duke Energy actively participates in the  
political process to ensure that local,  
state and federal lawmakers understand  
and consider the interests of the company  
and our customers, employees, 
shareholders and other stakeholders.

Duke Energy provides technical 
and financial expertise on proposed 
legislation to help lawmakers make 
informed decisions. In 2013, the 
company spent $7.240 million on 
reportable lobbying expenses (such as 
office space, salaries, consulting fees, 

2013 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT l 31

GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY

event fees, etc.) at the federal and  
state levels to promote sound and 
responsible public policies. That  
amount includes $383,000 in trade 
association dues used for policy 
research, information gathering and 
federal lobbying.

In 2013, Duke Energy also contributed 
$550,000 to political organizations, 
such as the Republican and Democratic 
governors associations, that advocate 
for issues and mobilize voters but do not 
directly support or oppose candidates.

The company is legally prohibited from 
making direct contributions to candidates 
for U.S. federal political offices. It is 
similarly prohibited from making direct 
contributions to candidates for state 
offices in certain states. In 2013, in 
states where corporate contributions  
are allowed, Duke Energy gave  
$1.361 million to support candidates, 
political parties and other political 
organizations and activities.

Duke Energy’s Political Activity Policy 
addresses company compliance with 
laws and regulations governing political 
contributions, government contacts and 
lobbying activities.

EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION

Many Duke Energy employees 
participate in the political process 
through DUKEPAC and Voices  
In Politics.

DUKEPAC is a voluntary, nonpartisan 
political action committee that 
contributes to federal and state 
candidates. The committee pools 
employee contributions to support 
political candidates who, if elected, 
might be involved in legislation that 
could have an impact on Duke Energy 
employees, customers, shareholders and 
other stakeholders.

Such legislation could involve utility 
industry structure; nuclear, coal, 
natural gas, hydro, wind or solar 
electricity generation; energy efficiency; 
environmental issues; tax reform; or 
employee benefits (health insurance, 
for example). DUKEPAC contributed 
$868,000 to state and federal 
candidates and political organizations  
in 2013.

Voices In Politics is Duke Energy’s 
grassroots education and advocacy 
network. It briefs employees on political 
issues and encourages them to actively 
support or oppose legislation that could 
impact the company. The network 

issues occasional “calls to action” 
regarding pending legislative votes that 
could affect the company’s operations.

DUKE ENERGY VALUES  
SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

Duke Energy’s overall supply chain 
includes more than 20,000 suppliers of 
non-fuel materials and services, mostly 
from domestic sources. The company 
spends about $8 billion annually, which 
includes capital expenditures on new 
power plant construction and other 
major projects. Our expenditures are 
split fairly equally between services and 
materials/equipment purchases.

Diverse suppliers bring great value to 
Duke Energy and the communities 
we serve. Diverse suppliers include 
businesses owned by minorities, 
women or veterans, service-disabled 
veterans and those located in Historically 
Underutilized Business zones 
(HUBZones). 

Our total spend (excluding fuel) has 
decreased about $1.5 billion over the 
past three years, with a $600 million 
decrease in 2013 alone. This is primarily 
because of the completion of several 
large construction projects. The decrease 
has negatively affected our spend with

LIGHTING THE WAY
Supply Chain: Power To The Pole

An innovative effort by Duke Energy is turning old utility poles and other waste 
wood into electricity – creating a recycling effort that is truly full circle.

Duke Energy purchases about 30,000 wooden utility poles annually – a vital 
component in delivering electricity to customers. Over time, those poles need 
replacing. So what happens to the old poles and other wood waste?

In the past, a small portion of the material was donated or reused, but more than 
90 percent of our 13,000 tons of waste wood was sent to landfills every year. Duke 
Energy now contracts with a vendor, National Salvage and Service, to collect and 
repurpose or recycle wood waste from most of our service territories. Today about 
30 percent of the wood is repurposed as wood products (poles, fence posts, and 
pallets), and 60 percent is shredded and used as fuel for electricity generation, 
leaving less than 10 percent of our wood waste for disposal in landfills.  

In the Carolinas, wood that cannot be repurposed is shredded at a new facility near 
Goldsboro, North Carolina. The area has suffered from high unemployment and 
this facility has created much-needed jobs for the community. The shredded wood 
is trucked to a biomass plant where it is burned to generate electricity. In most 
cases, the power is sold to … you guessed it … Duke Energy. 

From reduced landfill use, to job creation, to renewable energy, this program is a 
“win” for our company, our communities and our environment.

diverse suppliers, which fell in 2013 for 
the first time in several years. However, 
spend with diverse suppliers as a 
percentage of total spend continued to 
increase, rising from about 6 percent in 
2010 to 11 percent in 2013.

We work proactively to build 
relationships with current diverse 
suppliers as well as identify new 
suppliers. For example, in 2013 we 
served as the host sponsor of the 10th 
Annual Energizing Powerful Connections 
conference in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Along with four other utilities, we 
provided networking opportunities for 
utility-experienced diverse suppliers.  

We also encourage our Tier I suppliers 
to focus on and engage with diverse 
suppliers. As a result of this and other 
efforts, we saw an 18 percent increase 
in the number of Tier I suppliers who 
reported their Tier II diverse supplier 
spending in 2013. We see this increase 
as a strong positive sign for future results.

Duke Energy’s supplier diversity 
initiatives received several recognitions 
in 2013, including:

   A nomination for the National Minority 

Supplier Development Council 
Corporation of the Year Award

   The 2013 Corporate Partner of the

GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE 

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is 
a recognized international framework 
for economic, environmental and social 
performance disclosure. We provide a 
detailed response to GRI indicators on 
our website. We are transitioning our 
disclosures from G3 Version 3.1 to the 
new G4 reporting guidelines, and will 
continue disclosing for indicators in GRI’s 
Electric Utilities Sector Supplement.

Accurately measuring environmental 
and social data, and combining data 
from newly merged companies, can be 
challenging. We continually improve 
our data measurement, gathering and 
reporting processes to increase the 
integrity of information presented. To the 
extent possible and except where clearly 
noted, historical data are combined for 
the merged company. We correct and 
report errors in prior-year data when 
found. This report contains the best data 
available at the time of publication.

Cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information
This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking 
statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions.

These forward-looking statements are identified by terms and phrases such as “anticipate,” 
“believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “continue,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” 
“predict,” “will,” “potential,” “forecast,” “target,” “outlook,” “guidance,” and similar expressions. 
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be 
materially different from the results predicted. Factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: 
state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance with 
existing and future environmental requirements or climate change, as well as rulings that affect 
cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market prices; the ability to 
recover eligible costs, including those associated with future significant weather events, and earn 
an adequate return on investment through the regulatory process; the costs of decommissioning 
Crystal River unit 3 could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified and all costs 
may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process; the risk that the credit ratings of the 
combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what the companies expect; costs 
and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; 
industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer bases 
resulting from customer usage patterns, including energy efficiency effort and use of alternative 
energy sources including self-generation and distributed generation technologies; additional 
competition in electric markets and continued industry consolidation; political and regulatory 
uncertainty in other countries in which Duke Energy conducts business; the influence of weather 
and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, operational and other effects 
of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts and tornadoes; the ability to successfully operate electric 
generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers; the impact on facilities and business from 
a terrorist attack, cybersecurity threats, data security breaches and other catastrophic events; 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures, 
adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). These items are measured as 
income from continuing operations after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling interests, 
adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items and mark-to-market impacts of 
economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. Special items represent certain charges 
and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is 
reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. Mark-to-market adjustments reflect 
the impact of derivative contracts, which are used in Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the 
economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Power segment. The mark-to-market 
impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately as such derivative 
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of 
generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and 
output commodities (e.g., coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases 
and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the 
generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding 
impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until 
settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of 
economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes the presentation of adjusted 
earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an 
additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management uses 
these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the 
Board of Directors, employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke Energy’s 
financial performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and 
adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS 
attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common shareholders, which include the dollar and per 
share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial 
Power segment and discontinued operations.

the inherent risks associated with the operation and potential construction of nuclear facilities, 
including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks; the timing and extent of 
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the ability 
to recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on 
liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; the results of financing efforts, including the 
ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including 
credit ratings and general economic conditions; declines in the market prices of equity securities 
and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement 
benefit plans, and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; changes in rules for regional transmission 
organizations, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks 
related to obligations created by the default of other participants; the ability to control operation 
and maintenance costs; the level of creditworthiness of counterparties to transactions; employee 
workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain key personnel; the ability 
of subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to Duke Energy Corporation holding company (the 
Parent); the performance of projects undertaken by our nonregulated businesses and the success 
of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities; the effect of accounting pronouncements 
issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; the impact of potential goodwill 
impairments; the ability to reinvest retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries or repatriate such 
earnings on a tax free basis; and the ability to successfully complete future merger, acquisition or 
divestiture plans.  

Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in Duke Energy’s reports filed with 
the SEC and available at the SEC’s website at sec.gov. In light of these risks, uncertainties and 
assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might 
occur to a different extent or at a different time than Duke Energy has described. Duke Energy 
undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as  
a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
