About This Report

The electric utility industry is changing, and Duke Energy is changing with it.

This year’s Sustainability Report focuses on how Duke Energy is adapting to 
meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are fine-tuning our business 
approach and better integrating innovation and technology as we prepare for a 
future that includes complex environmental regulations, global efforts to stem 
climate change and variable customer usage trends.

Even in this time of transition, maintaining a focus on our customers and 
the communities we serve, employee engagement and development, and 
operational excellence is central to our mission. 

Sustainability is an integral component of Duke Energy’s fabric. With our 
recent reorganization and the growth of our Sustainability Corps, we now 
have sustainability-focused employees throughout the company rather than 
centralized in one department. 

This approach is allowing sustainability to spread and grow at Duke Energy.  
It has taken root across all areas of the company. Doing what’s right for  
people, planet and profits is a belief we all share.

For those of you familiar with our past reports, you will still see a wealth of 
great data compiled in one place. There are both online and print versions of 
this year’s report available. On our website, you will also find a detailed Global 
Reporting Initiative index. As always, we aim to make sure our information is 
comprehensive, clear and paints an accurate picture of the company. Thank you 
for your interest in Duke Energy.

2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 3 /Lynn J. Good / Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

A Message From Our CEO

Dear stakeholders:
At Duke Energy, 2015 was a year of 
accomplishment and new beginnings. We took 
bold strides to better serve our customers – 
today and in the future – by embracing new 
technologies and applying innovative solutions  
to address their diverse and changing needs. 

Committed to safety 
We view safety through the lens of employees, 
communities and the environment. Of all our 
achievements in 2015, I’m most pleased  
by what we accomplished in this area. Our  
employee Total Incident Case Rate, a key safety 
performance measure, decreased by almost  
30 percent, making Duke Energy one of the  
best in the industry, and we continue to 
strengthen contractor safety. 

I’m equally proud of the industry-leading solutions 
we developed for safely managing coal ash.  
We are working to close all our coal ash basins  
in ways that protect our communities and  
the environment. 

An industry in transition
We are part of a dynamic industry that is being 
reshaped by evolving customer expectations, 
rapidly changing technologies and new 
public policies. One of our more significant 
achievements in 2015 was the development of 
a long-term, customer-focused strategy for the 
future to address the transformation. We are 
providing smarter energy solutions by generating 

cleaner energy, modernizing the power grid and 
transforming the customer experience. 

Generating cleaner energy
Duke Energy is a leader in the transition to cleaner  
energy solutions. Since 2005, we have reduced 
our tons of carbon emissions by 28 percent. 

Last year, more than 40 percent of our electricity 
came from carbon-free sources – largely due to 
our nuclear fleet, which accounted for a third of 
our total generation in 2015. We are evaluating 
extending the life of our existing nuclear plants 
and possibly building new ones. 

Natural gas has also played an important role in 
this transition. We’ve significantly expanded our 
natural gas platform through new gas-fired power 
plants, pipeline investments and the planned 
acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. 

In the Carolinas alone, we’ve retired half of our 
coal plants and replaced them with new natural 
gas plants and renewables – which will be an 
increasing part of our portfolio in the future. In 
the U.S., we’ve already invested $4 billion in 
wind and solar energy facilities since 2007 – 
enough to power about 740,000 homes at peak 
production – and plan to invest $3 billion more 
over the next five years. 

Modernizing the power grid
In order to meet our customers’ expectations  
and integrate new technologies, we are 
modernizing the power grid. Our goal is to 
improve the customer experience by making

process. We serve more than 24 million people every day with 
a vital service. As we continue this journey of transformation, 
working with all stakeholders will be important to get it right.”

power outages increasingly rare and service 
restoration faster – advancing self-healing 
technologies and smart meters. 

As more renewables are added to our system,  
the grid will need to evolve. The intermittent 
nature of these technologies is placing new 
demands on the grid, including the need for  
a two-way flow of electricity. 

Batteries are important in overcoming this 
challenge and we are working to realize their 
greatest potential on our system. From a wind 
farm in Texas to a microgrid in North Carolina, 
we are investing in battery projects around the 
country to learn more about this technology. 

Transforming the customer experience
Customer expectations are evolving; they want 
choice, control and convenience along with 
affordability and reliability. At Duke Energy, 
customers are at the center of everything we  
do and we are working hard every day to meet 
these changing expectations. 

We’re communicating with customers in ways 
they prefer, such as through our social media 
channels, two-way texting for outage reporting 
and high-usage notifications. Customers want 
more control over their energy usage, and we’ve 
responded with energy efficiency programs that 
also help promote a lower-emission future. Earlier 
this year, one of our residential programs reached 
a milestone of one terawatt-hour of electricity 
saved – enough to power 70,000 homes for  
a year. 

We have seen modest improvement in customer 
satisfaction scores over the course of 2015, but 
our work is never over. We will continue to focus 
on what is important to customers, including fair 
prices, reliable power and cleaner energy sources. 

Shaping the future together
Transformation of the power industry is a complex 
and dynamic process. We serve more than  
24 million people every day with a vital service. 
As we continue this journey of transformation, 
working closely with all stakeholders will be 
important to get it right, including the pace and 
timing of investments in new technologies. 
At Duke Energy, we will focus on the unique 
requirements of each customer, building 
infrastructure for thriving communities and 
creating a safe energy future.

Sincerely,

Lynn J. Good

2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 5 /How Duke Energy Creates Value – 2015

As stakeholders of Duke Energy, it’s important to understand 
how the company uses financial, natural and human 
resources to create the value investors, employees, 
customers and communities expect.

It’s also important to know the “what’s next” in that equation. 
We must be stewards of the natural resources we rely on 
today, but also move forward to promote cleaner power and 
a more efficient business for the next generation. That’s how 
you create sustainable value for all stakeholders.

It starts with being a good neighbor. Establishing and 
maintaining the trust of stakeholders while moving toward 
a clean, healthy, natural environment with successful 
communities and strong financial performance.  
That’s Duke Energy.

Major Resources
Production of electricity requires coal, natural gas and 
other materials extracted from the earth. The company 
also needs water to produce electricity at hydroelectric 
facilities – and cooling water for fossil fuel and nuclear 
plants. And we need employees to make it all work. 
Duke Energy is committed to recruiting and retaining a 
highly skilled workforce to ensure long-term success of 
our operations. Our No. 1 focus continues to be safety 
for those working for us – and the general public.

Evolving Business Model 
Duke Energy’s goal is to produce and deliver reliable 
and cost-effective energy to homes and businesses. 
But customer expectations and technologies are 
changing. People are seeking ways to more actively 
manage their energy consumption. Customers are 
demanding Duke Energy be more nimble to deliver 
new services. Communication systems are changing 
from one-way to two-way. Helping our customers 
increase their energy efficiency is also part of the 
company’s evolving business model. In the past, the 
company made money on how much power it sold. 
The new business model is a combination of selling 
electricity and helping save it for customers. 

Impacts 
Part of Duke Energy’s mission is to minimize our 
environmental impact. Therefore, we track our impacts 
and strive to improve. We emit 0.99 pounds of carbon 
dioxide for every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity 
produced. But that’s lower than 1.2 pounds produced 
10 years ago. About 98 percent of the water Duke 
Energy uses is returned to streams and rivers. But 
the company does consume water – about 79 billion 
gallons in 2015.

Value Created 
Putting a value on the electricity and natural gas  
Duke Energy sells is easy. Add up all the energy  
bills in 2015 and the company’s total revenue  
was around $23.5 billion. It’s harder to put a price 
on what that energy is really worth – it powers the 
economy like no other commodity. Duke Energy  
also supports communities with the taxes it pays, 
as well as through philanthropic contributions and 
employee volunteerism.

Investors also receive value from Duke Energy in the 
form of growth, dividends and interest payments. We 
also employ more than 28,000 people. They, like the 
vendors we use, play their own part in supporting the 
communities where they live and work. The value 
Duke Energy creates isn’t limited to power generation 
– it’s a steady stream from many areas. It’s not a 
simple story, but it’s a story with impact.

Energy efficiency:  
Responding to customers 
We’re hearing customers loud and clear when 
they say they want to know more about our 
energy efficiency programs. 

Programs vary by state, but together Duke Energy 
is helping customers lower their carbon footprint 
and save money. 

“My Home Energy Report” provides residential 
customers with a meaningful look at their energy 
use compared to similar homes based on age, 
size, location and heating source. It provides 
targeted insights to help them take action to 
reduce their energy consumption. Over the past 
six years, this program has saved more than  
1 terawatt-hour of electricity. That’s enough to 
fully power 70,000 homes for a year. 

In most states, to get that personal touch, the 
company offers a “home energy audit.” A trained 
technician visits customers’ homes and gives 
expert advice on how they can save money. 

One customer remarked she had not thought 
about insulating her attic door. But an uninsulated 
attic door loses energy 38 times faster than 
similar ceiling space that is insulated.

Since 2009, the company has provided more 
than 70 million deeply discounted energy-efficient 
lighting products through direct order platforms, 
participating retailers and Duke Energy’s Online 
Savings Store. Cutting-edge LEDs have become

IT’S MY JOB TO HELP YOU SAVE ENERGY (AND MONEY )!

Each day, Ken Muth works hard to help customers save money. As a business energy advisor, Muth 
works with hundreds of Duke Energy’s mid-sized commercial customers in Ohio and Kentucky on 
ways they can lower their energy use and earn cash incentives for installing high-efficiency lighting 
and equipment. 

Case in point: Crossroads Church in Mason, Ohio. The 114,000-square-foot facility – originally built 
as a paper mill – qualified for nearly $55,000 in energy efficiency incentives from Duke Energy. But 
that’s not all – Crossroads is also likely to see sustained energy savings of more than $50,000 per year.

“One of Crossroads’ focus areas is mission work,” said Muth. “It’s humbling to know that every dollar  
I help them save can be put toward projects that improve lives throughout this region and around  
the world.”

Duke Energy employees volunteer to 
recycle old electronics
More than 50 Duke Energy employees collected 
and sorted old computers, TVs, cellphones and 
other items as volunteers at Cincinnati’s 2015 
“Players for the Planet E-Waste Recycling Drive” – 
a four-day roundup of electronic equipment  
to recycle. 

The drive, supported by professional sports 
players in the Cincinnati area, collected nearly 
100 tons of electronic waste that otherwise  
might have ended up in local landfills.

Older model TVs and computer monitors can 
contain up to 6 pounds of toxic lead, which  
can cause potential public health risks if not 
property recycled.

Rankings mixed, but satisfaction scores 
improve again
While Duke Energy’s rankings were mixed, 
customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores improved for 
both business and residential segments in 2015. 

Customer satisfaction remains a top priority, 
and all Duke Energy regulated utilities are 
implementing plans to achieve top quartile 
performance in the J.D. Power Residential Study 
by the end of 2018 – that’s how we’ll measure if 
we’re meeting customers’ expectations.

Business customers: Large business customers 
continue to give Duke Energy high marks for the 
service they receive, with 89 percent “highly 
satisfied” with Duke Energy as their utility. 

Overall, satisfaction scores increased for all four 
Duke Energy companies in the 2016 J.D. Power 
Business Study, with three increasing more than 
the national average.

   Duke Energy Carolinas increased an impressive 
50 points to 728, putting it in the top quartile 
for this study.

   Duke Energy Midwest was up 32 points to 

708, just one point below the second quartile.

   Duke Energy Progress was up 31 points to 
703, and remained in the third quartile.

   Duke Energy Florida was up 23 points to 690, 

its highest score in more than eight years.

PROTECTING, IMPROVING AND RESTORING REGIONAL WATERWAYS

Regional waterways are the lifeblood of vibrant communities. Duke Energy is committed  
to being a good neighbor. This also means being a good steward of the environment and 
the waterways surrounding our operations. 

In 2015, 28 nonprofit organizations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia 
received more than $2 million to help protect rivers, lakes and streams in those states. 
The projects were funded through the Water Resources Fund, a $10 million investment by 
the company to protect waterways in the Carolinas and downstream from Duke Energy’s 
Carolinas operations. 

One of the projects is the Dutch Creek Stream Restoration and Education Initiative in 
Watauga County, North Carolina. 

The Valle Crucis Community Park used its $77,000 grant to restore more than 800 feet 
of a degraded reach of Dutch Creek using natural channel design methods. Structures 
also were installed to re-establish and enhance fish and hellbender salamander habitats. 
Already, the county game warden has reported seeing trout feeding in the creek for the  
first time in years.  

During construction, fifth-grade classes from adjacent Valle Crucis Elementary School 
received on-site lessons about wetland restoration and helped install plants along the 
stream bank.  

In the Midwest, a $250,000 Duke Energy Foundation grant is enabling Thomas More 
College to boost fish and water quality research programs at its Thomas More Biology Field 
Station in Campbell County, Kentucky. The funds are also being used to expand science, 
technology, engineering and math (STEM) partnerships with teachers and students 
throughout the Greater Cincinnati region. 

A separate $250,000 grant to the University of Cincinnati is helping the Great Miami 
Ground-Water Observatory to establish an early detection system for threats to water in  
the Great Miami Buried Valley Aquifer System. The university also is using grant money  
to expand its summer environmental research training program for teachers.

These projects are inspiring and creating a difference in our communities. They’re 
investments in the ongoing and future sustainability of our regions.

Duke Energy has been 
supporting Thomas More 
College’s Ohio River  
research since 1971.

2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 15 /PROMOTING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

A key to successful stakeholder engagement is companies engaging in an ongoing two-way 
dialogue and making the effort to understand issues from numerous viewpoints. That’s 
why Duke Energy continues to solicit input from a diverse range of customer, community, 
environmental and business groups. We work to find areas of common interest from which 
to build a foundation for consensus. These discussions can be challenging, and sometimes 
frustrating, but engagement from a broad stakeholder group typically results in positive 
outcomes for the communities we serve.

Photo caption: Gary Cook discusses power plant operations with members of the Northern Kentucky 
Chamber of Commerce and the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber of Commerce.

The study rates companies on six factors: power 
quality and reliability, billing and payment, 
corporate citizenship, price, communications  
and customer service. 

Residential customers: Eighty percent of  
our residential customers were highly satisfied 
with the service they received from Duke Energy 
in 2015. 

Satisfaction scores were up for all four operating 
companies in the 2015 J.D. Power Residential 
Study. But the company continues to be in  
the bottom half among utilities in the regions  
we serve.

   Duke Energy Midwest was up 20 points to 

664, placing it in the third quartile nationally 
among all large utilities. 

   Duke Energy Carolinas was up 22 points to 
663, placing it in the third quartile nationally 
among all large utilities. 

   Duke Energy Progress was up 18 points to 

655, placing it in the third quartile nationally 
among all large utilities.

   Duke Energy Florida was up 12 points to 622, 

placing it in the fourth quartile among all  
large utilities. 

Connecting with our customers online
For decades, if customers wanted to communicate  
with Duke Energy, they picked up the phone. 
But, as the population becomes busier and 
more wired, our customers are finding other 
communication channels can work best for them.

They want to communicate on their timetable, 
using the platforms they feel comfortable with – 
like Twitter and Facebook.

In 2009, there was only one Duke Energy 
employee responsible for the two-way 
conversations on social media to handle  
service inquiries from customers.

Our team has grown over the years as customers 
have rapidly embraced social media as a way to 
communicate with us. During 2015 alone, the 
customer social media team handled more than 
45,000 incoming messages. The most common 
questions dealt with reporting outages and  
billing issues.

But topics like tree trimming were also addressed. 
Customers also ran to social media when they felt 
they were not making progress in their attempts 
to communicate with the company through other 
channels. Many times, a problem in the morning 
was happily resolved by the afternoon.

Social media channels also allowed the 
company to push out important messages. 
We communicated widely on scams involving 
criminals posing as utility workers – stopping 
thieves claiming to have the ability to shut off 
power unless money was quickly wired to them.

The future looks positive with this type of 
customer engagement. Additional resources and 
extended hours of operation could make social 
media interactions with Duke Energy as common 
as picking up the telephone.

Purchasing: What does it mean to  
the neighborhood?
Duke Energy spends between $8 billion and  
$10 billion a year purchasing everything from  
wind turbines to office supplies.

Quality and cost are prime drivers of these 
decisions. But customers have told us corporate 
sustainability should be in the mix, too. That’s 
why supplier diversity, local economic impact  
and environmental stewardship are part of  
Duke Energy’s purchasing equation.

In 2015, working with NC State University 
and Duke University, the company developed 
a method to assess the economic impact of 
our spending. Out of the $8.2 billion we spent 
in 2014, $2.7 billion was spent with local 
companies in our six retail states. That’s  
32 percent of our overall spend.

That $2.7 billion in local spending helps support 
close to 26,000 jobs. It also means an extra  
$1.7 billion in salaries, local purchases and 
business taxes are kept in our communities.

Duke Energy selects suppliers that provide the 
most value to our customers and shareholders, 
while creating broader value for the company and 
the communities we serve. We also continue to 
focus on diversity and environmental stewardship.

The future? We expect our increased focus on 
sustainability criteria in purchasing decisions  
to lead to even more local spending.

  Meet our target growth rate of 4 to 6 percent in the 

face of stagnant load growth.

  Take advantage of new technologies and customer 
expectations to find new ways to grow our business.

Duke Energy prepares for electric utility 
industry’s rapidly changing future 
The electric utility industry is in transition:

   Customer expectations are evolving. Customers 

now expect more convenience, choice and 
control with even greater reliability and value. 

   Rapidly changing technology is reshaping the 
way our customers consume electricity. This 
includes distributed generation, like rooftop 
solar, and energy management technologies.

   Greater energy efficiency is flattening growth  

in energy consumption. 

   Cleaner fuel choices are becoming even  

more important as we move toward a lower-
carbon future. 

   New public policies, like environmental 

regulations, are shaping the energy landscape. 

After closely examining these trends and  
their implications, Duke Energy developed  
“The Road Ahead”, our long-term strategy  
to guide investments and deliver greater value  
to customers:

   Transform the customer experience: To give 
customers the experience they want, we are 
investing in innovation and new technologies – 
services like usage alerts, outage notifications 
and customized billing options.

   Modernize the power grid: We are 

investing in a more resilient power delivery 
system, decreasing outages and enabling

BATTERIES GET A CHARGE IN INDIANA

Developing the capacity to store electricity will play an important role in the future integration 
of distributed resources, like wind and solar generation. Duke Energy has projects around the 
country that are helping us understand the capabilities storage can bring to the system. For 
example, the company is partnering with the Battery Innovation Center in Southern Indiana 
and funding $1.5 million in research to study how battery storage can work with intermittent 
resources like solar and wind. In addition to the research, two Indiana schools – Bloomington 
High School South in Bloomington and Northwestern School Corporation in Kokomo – will 
serve as test sites in 2016, incorporating battery technology with their own renewable  
energy sources.

advanced two-way power grid to accommodate 
more renewable energy and emerging 
technologies such as battery storage  
and microgrids.

term returns for its investors. As part of these  
efforts, the Board of Directors voted in June 2015  
to increase the dividend growth rate to 
approximately 4 percent, double the rate at which 
the dividend had grown annually since 2010.

   Generate cleaner energy: We are continuing 

our efforts to decrease greenhouse gas 
emissions in a way that preserves affordable 
rates and reliability. We are shifting our 
generation mix to more natural gas and 
renewable energy. 

   Engage employees and other stakeholders: 

We will mobilize the ideas of employees to 
ensure operational excellence. Externally, 
we will engage regulators, policymakers, 
customers and others to discuss industry 
changes and the path forward. 

No matter how quickly or significantly the 
industry changes, Duke Energy will continue to 
lead the way to cleaner, smarter energy solutions. 
For more information, please read “Planning for 
the Future” in the online edition of this report.  

Maintaining sustainable financial growth 
In 2015, Duke Energy achieved adjusted diluted 
earnings per share of $4.54. This was driven 
by strong growth in the regulated business, 
which helped offset weakness in the company’s 
international business segment.

One of Duke Energy’s primary goals as a 
sustainable company is delivering attractive long-

Over the past several years, Duke Energy has 
focused on situating its core domestic regulated 
and highly contracted commercial businesses 
for growth. These core businesses provide more 
stable earnings and cash flows, supporting 
the company’s financial objectives. These 
core businesses are well situated to contribute 
adjusted diluted earnings per share within the 
company’s 4 to 6 percent growth objectives  
from 2016 to 2020.

Duke Energy’s total shareholder return – the 
change in stock price plus dividends – for 2015  
declined by 10.8 percent. This was a greater 
decline than the 6.3 percent decline of the 
Philadelphia Utility Index (20 U.S. utilities) 
during the same period and the S&P 500’s 
total shareholder return of 1.4 percent. Over a 
longer-term, five-year time frame, Duke Energy’s 
annualized total shareholder return of  
11.0 percent outperformed the Philadelphia 
Utility Index annualized return of 9.7 percent  
and underperformed the S&P 500’s annualized  
return of 12.6 percent.

Spotlight on renewable energy
Duke Energy continues to add more solar and 
wind energy to our generation mix – incorporating

more renewable resources for the benefit of our 
customers. Major projects announced in  
2015 include:

   In Florida, Duke Energy is developing solar 
projects that will provide up to 500 MW of 
solar capacity over the next 10 years. The 
company also announced a one-of-a-kind 
5-MW solar facility at Walt Disney World® – 
shaped like a “not-so-hidden-Mickey.”

   In Indiana, the company is partnering with 

the Navy to develop a 17-MW solar facility at 
Crane Naval Base, which will be the second 
largest in the state.

   In North Carolina, Duke Energy continues a 

major solar expansion – completing 141 MW  
of capacity at four facilities – including one at 
the Camp Lejeune military base.

   In South Carolina, the company introduced 
several options for customers to participate 
in solar, including a solar rebate program for 
customers who install up to 1 MW of solar  
on their property.

The company’s commercial entity, Duke Energy 
Renewables, brought 10 solar projects on line 
in 2015, eight in North Carolina and two in 
California – totaling about 200 MW.

Duke Energy Renewables also added more than 
400 MW to its wind portfolio in 2015 with three 
projects in Texas. The total amount of wind power 
the company operates now stands at about 
2,000 MW.

Duke Energy built two 2-MW battery-based 
energy storage systems at its retired W.C. 
Beckjord coal-fired power plant in Ohio.  
This continues the company’s exploration of  
energy storage solutions and their potential  
for broad adoption.

The company acquired a majority interest 
in California-based REC Solar, a provider of 
rooftop and ground-mounted solar systems 
for commercial-scale customers. REC Solar is 
partnering with Green Charge Networks, also  
in California, to augment solar energy with  
energy storage systems, increasing savings  
for customers.

Duke Energy Progress buys municipal 
power agency’s generation assets
Duke Energy Progress bought 701 MW of 
electricity generation assets for approximately 
$1.25 billion from the North Carolina Eastern 
Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA) in 2015.

The assets comprised NCEMPA’s minority 
ownership interest in four North Carolina power 
plants – Brunswick Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2, 
Harris Nuclear Plant, Mayo Plant and Roxboro 
Plant Unit 4 (Mayo and Roxboro are coal plants) 
– all operated and majority-owned by Duke 
Energy Progress.

NCEMPA consists of 32 eastern North Carolina 
cities and towns that own and operate municipal 
electric systems, collectively serving about 
270,000 retail customers. 

\ 20 \  DUKE ENERGY  For Duke Energy Progress customers, the 
purchase provides long-term power plant  
fuel savings that will help keep electricity  
rates affordable.

For NCEMPA’s cities and towns, the purchase 
provides important economic benefits, including 
reduced or eliminated debt from the agency’s 
1980s investments in the power plants.  

As part of the sale, Duke Energy Progress and 
NCEMPA signed a 30-year wholesale power 
supply agreement under which Duke Energy 
Progress will meet the full electricity requirements 
of NCEMPA’s member cities and towns.

NCEMPA members’ electricity distribution assets 
were not part of the sale, and will continue to be 
owned and maintained by the members.

North Carolina.

Cleaner burning natural gas provides 
benefits in Florida and the Carolinas
Duke Energy is also building two natural gas 
power plants in Florida and South Carolina. 
Building highly efficient natural gas plants is  
part of Duke Energy’s long-term strategy to  
meet future demand for reliable electricity in  
an environmentally responsible way.

In Florida, the Citrus County combined-cycle 
natural gas plant, targeted to open in 2018, 
will supply 1,640 MW of power to the more 
than 4 million people and businesses we serve 
in the state. The new plant will be one of the 
cleanest and most efficient in the company’s fleet 
and contribute about $600 million to the local 
economy and tax base. Two nearby 1960s-era 
coal-fired units will be closed when the Citrus 
plant opens, further reducing our coal capacity 
by 900 MW and our carbon emissions in Florida 
by 8 percent. Since 2005, Duke Energy’s air 
emissions in Florida have been reduced by  
about 80 percent.

In South Carolina, the new W.S. Lee combined-
cycle natural gas plant in Anderson County 

Economic development activities spur growth in our communities 

Duke Energy works with state and local authorities

will supply 750 MW of electricity to the more 
than 9 million people and businesses served 
by Duke Energy Carolinas. Construction is well 
underway and the plant is expected to come 
on line in November 2017. During the height of 
construction, 500 temporary construction jobs 
will be created. Duke Energy previously retired 
two coal-fired units and converted a third to 
natural gas at the same site. As of 2014, Duke 
Energy no longer operates coal-fired plants in 
South Carolina.

Duke Energy seeks to acquire  
Piedmont Natural Gas
Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas 
announced in 2015 an agreement under which 
Duke Energy would acquire Piedmont for 
approximately $4.9 billion in cash and assume 
about $1.8 billion of Piedmont’s existing debt.  
The acquisition is subject to the North Carolina 
Utilities Commission’s approval and other 
regulatory reviews.

Piedmont is an energy services company 
primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas 
to more than 1 million residential, commercial, 
industrial and power generation utility customers 
in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

Piedmont’s subsidiaries are invested in joint 
venture energy-related businesses, including 
regulated interstate natural gas transportation  
and storage and unregulated retail natural  
gas marketing.

The acquisition would make Duke Energy the 
nation’s 15th largest natural gas local distribution 
company (LDC), as measured by the number 

of natural gas LDC customers – 1.5 million 
(Piedmont’s 1 million and Duke Energy’s existing 
525,000 in the Midwest).

“We look forward to welcoming Piedmont’s 
customers and employees to Duke Energy,” said 
Duke Energy President and CEO Lynn Good. 
“This combination provides us with a growing 
natural gas platform, benefiting our customers, 
communities and investors.”

The purchase is targeted to close by  
year-end 2016.

Piedmont would retain its name, operating as a 
business unit of Duke Energy. Both companies 
are headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Duke Energy invests in second  
natural gas pipeline
Duke Energy expanded its investment in interstate 
natural gas pipelines in 2015, committing  
$225 million to purchase a 7.5 percent 
ownership stake in the new $3 billion Sabal  
Trail pipeline that will traverse Alabama, Georgia 
and Florida to meet growing demand for natural 
gas in the southeast U.S.

The pipeline will have the capacity to deliver 
about 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day 
when it begins service, targeted for mid-2017. 

Duke Energy Florida will use natural gas 
transported by the pipeline to fuel its new  
$1.5 billion power plant in Citrus County,  
Florida, scheduled to open in 2018.

Duke Energy also holds a 40 percent ownership 
stake in the proposed $4.5 billion to $5 billion 

2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 23 /In 2015, the company’s reportable federal 
lobbying expenses (e.g., office space, salaries, 
consulting fees, event fees, etc.) included nearly 
$892,4301 in trade association dues used for 
policy research, information gathering and federal 
lobbying by organizations such as EEI and the 
Nuclear Energy Institute. In 2015, Duke Energy 
also contributed approximately $945,4852 to 
political organizations, such as the Republican 
and Democratic governors associations, which 
advocate for policies and mobilize voters, but 
do not directly support or oppose candidates. 
The company is legally prohibited from making 
direct contributions to candidates for U.S. federal 
political offices. In certain states, it is similarly 
prohibited from making direct contributions to 
candidates for state office. 

Duke Energy’s Political Activity Policy requires 
company compliance with laws and regulations 
governing political contributions, government 
contacts and lobbying activities.

Duke Energy employees participate in the political 
process through DUKEPAC and Voices In Politics. 
DUKEPAC is a voluntary, nonpartisan political 
action committee that contributes to federal and 
state candidates. The committee pools employee 
contributions to support political candidates 
who support policies important to Duke Energy 
employees, customers, shareholders, the 
communities the company serves and other 
stakeholders. Such policies could involve utility 
industry structure; nuclear, coal, natural gas, 
hydro, wind or solar electricity generation; energy 
efficiency; environmental issues; tax reform 
or employee benefits (e.g., health insurance). 
DUKEPAC contributed $876,100 to state and 
federal candidates and political organizations  
in 2015.

Voices In Politics is Duke Energy’s grassroots 
education and advocacy network. It educates 
employees on political and policy issues and 
encourages them to become active in the political  
process by supporting or opposing policies  
that could affect the company. The network 
occasionally issues a “call to action” regarding  
pending legislation that could affect the 
company’s operations, employees or stakeholders.

Atlantic Coast Pipeline – a nearly 600-mile 
natural gas pipeline from West Virginia through 
Virginia to North Carolina – scheduled to begin  
service in late 2018, pending regulatory approvals. 

Duke Energy’s pipeline investments underscore 
the company’s commitment to build critical 
natural gas infrastructure in the Southeast,  
where natural gas has become an important 
power plant fuel that provides significant 
environmental benefits.

Natural gas power plants release significantly 
smaller amounts of CO2 and other emissions  
than do coal plants.

Political engagement informs  
policymakers about our preparations  
for the future
Duke Energy actively participates in the political  
process so local, state and federal lawmakers 
understand and consider the interests of the  
company, its customers, employees, shareholders,  
communities and other stakeholders when 
developing public policies. Duke Energy provides 
technical and intellectual expertise on potential 
costs, benefits and impacts of proposed policies 
to help lawmakers make educated decisions.

\ 24 \  DUKE ENERGY  Toray Industries Groundbreaking / South Carolina

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 

The recent groundbreaking at Toray Industries in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, 
grabbed plenty of headlines. 

To the casual observer, it appeared a group of company executives got together with state 
officials and representatives from Duke Energy and decided this was a good time and 
place to put up a building.

Not so. 

Duke Energy’s business recruitment team had actually been working on this economic 
development opportunity since 2007.

It took a long time to find just the right location and circumstances before anyone was 
ready to grab a ceremonial shovel.

There are a lot of states vying for the jobs and other economic benefits a prized company 
like Toray represents. And it takes the planning, patience, diligence and persistence of 
economic developers to achieve success.

Duke Energy works with its states and counties to make sure they’re ready when an 
opportunity arises. The company currently maintains 15 sites in five states through its  
Site Readiness Program that have been groomed to entice new or expanding businesses. 

Preparation is much more than lifting a shovel full of dirt.

Photo caption: The groundbreaking at Toray Industries brought out Duke Energy CEO Lynn Good 
(second from left) and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (center, in light blue).

“ We’ve traveled the world, 
meeting with leading 
manufacturers and sharing

met Toray more than a half 
dozen years ago and that’s 
how we’ll continue to power 
manufacturing in the years 
to come.”

Hydroelectric projects from the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.

Challenges and Opportunities
  Continue to improve employee and contractor safety.

  Continue to demonstrate our commitment to 

operational excellence.

Safety: Progress with vision for the future
At Duke Energy, safety is more than a corporate 
priority; it is a core company value. Safety is 
job one, every day. We value the safety of our 
employees, contractors and communities and 
are taking action to prevent incidents. Building 
upon the success, and failures, of past years, our 
mission is to create a safer place to work and live, 
where everyone gets to go home at the end of  
the workday.

In 2015, Duke Energy enhanced and 
implemented several initiatives to improve safety 
performance. For example, the rollout of an 
improved contractor safety program in September 
2015 puts more rigor around selecting, managing 
and providing oversight to contractors.

In addition, business units executed “Keys to 
Life” control plans that reduced risk and improved 
worker behaviors related to high-hazard activities. 
And our Transmission and Delivery Operations 
group did a deep dive into its injury data that 
led to a renewed mission to eradicate electrical 
contact events. 

The results of our new and existing safety 
initiatives and processes led to substantially 
improved performance in our 2015 safety 
measures. Duke Energy had zero employee 
fatalities. We also decreased our Employee Total 
Incident Case Rate (TICR) by almost 30 percent 
to 0.41. Tragically, there were five contractor 
fatalities, all of which were traffic related. We are 
working together with our contractor partners to 
address these safety concerns.

\ 26 \  DUKE ENERGY  INNOVATION IN ACTION 

As part of our pursuit of operational excellence, Duke Energy’s Generation and Transmission 
group challenged employees to seek out ways to reduce environmental and safety hazards. 
Jerry Lee DeWeese took the challenge seriously when he sought a way to eliminate the  
risk of oil entering the waterway at a hydroelectric plant if there is an oil cooler leak or  
water intrusion.

Jerry developed a low-cost water detector that can be retrofitted to equipment to detect water 
and prevent oil from getting into the river. This device can send a signal to the control system 
to alert technicians of the trouble and allow quick action, including a controlled shutdown of 
the unit. His device could also be used at other manned and unmanned generation facilities. 
Another way innovation is helping sustainability at Duke Energy.

Jerry Lee DeWeese / Lead Engineer, Carolinas Hydro Operations

We are pleased about our improvements but 
not satisfied with our results. In 2016, we 
are launching a five-year plan that will drive 
continued focus on event-free operations and 
challenge the company to reach even greater 
safety success by 2020. 

Striving toward a lower-carbon future
Duke Energy is committed to a cleaner, smarter 
energy future. We have worked to modernize 
our system and established voluntary carbon 
reduction goals in 2010. 

Our tons of CO2 emissions have decreased  
28 percent since 2005. In addition, the CO2 
intensity of our generating fleet is more than  
23 percent lower, producing fewer emissions per 
kWh. More than 40 percent of the electricity we 
generated in 2015 was from carbon-free sources: 
nuclear, hydro, wind and solar. Our current five-
year business plan includes plans to retire more 
than 1,800 MW of coal generation, invest  
$4 billion in new, efficient natural gas facilities 
and invest $3 billion in renewables.

The Clean Power Plan (CPP) is a new federal 
regulation by the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) that establishes 
performance standards for CO2 emissions from 
existing fossil-fueled power plants – those 
that use coal, oil or natural gas to produce 
electricity. Twenty-seven states and numerous 
industry organizations have challenged the 
rule in the courts, and 18 states have filed 

petitions in support of it. In February 2016, the 
U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the CPP, 
suspending the regulation from going into effect 
while legal challenges are heard by the courts.  
It is unclear when the legal challenges will be 
fully resolved. 

If the rule is ultimately upheld, EPA estimates  
the regulation will reduce CO2 emissions by  
32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, 
although specific reduction targets vary by 
state. Regardless of the legal outcome of the 
CPP, we remain committed to reduce emissions 
and invest in energy technologies that are good 
for our customers, our communities and the 
environment. Duke Energy will continue to work 
constructively with our states as they decide  
their path forward.

Protecting our water resources:  
New operating license will sustain  
region for generations to come 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
issued a new operating license to Duke Energy 
effective November 1, 2015, for the Catawba-
Wateree Hydroelectric Project, which includes  
13 hydropower stations and 11 reservoirs in 
North Carolina and South Carolina. The project 
provides drinking water for nearly 2 million 
people, supports energy generation and offers 
numerous recreational opportunities to residents 
and visitors. The new license ensures the

ENSURING WIND POWER CAN COE XIST WITH EAGLES, BATS   

Duke Energy is committed to minimizing bird and bat 
fatalities caused by turbine blade collisions at its clean-energy 
wind power projects.

To protect eagles at Duke Energy’s Top of the World 
Windpower Project in Wyoming, wildlife specialists in a 
specially built tower scan the sky and shut down turbines 
when eagles approach. The company also is testing new 
technology that automatically shuts down turbines when 
high-resolution cameras detect eagles.

To protect bats at several of its wind power projects, Duke 
Energy significantly reduces turbine blade speed during 
low-wind conditions in late summer and early fall, which 
coincides with bats’ migration and breeding season.

“We’re on the leading edge of addressing this issue,” says 
Tim Hayes, Duke Energy Renewables’ environmental director.

Catawba-Wateree River will continue to support 
and sustain communities for at least the next  
40 years.

With the new license in hand, Duke Energy 
will invest about $100 million to implement an 
agreement designed over a three-year period with 
input from about 160 community stakeholders. 
The agreement’s new benefits range from 
operational changes to protect aquatic habitats 
to land conservation to new and enhanced 
recreation amenities.

The new license includes several water 
management provisions designed to ensure 
long-term availability of the water resource. 
A new drought management protocol will be 
implemented by a regional advisory group 
composed of major water users, governmental 
agencies and Duke Energy. Another organization 
of regional water utilites and Duke Energy will 
study and implement long-range strategies to 
ensure the region’s water supply continues to  
be sustainable.

Duke Energy also received a new operating 
license in April 2015 for its Yadkin-Pee Dee 
Hydroelectric Project, which includes two 
hydropower stations and associated reservoirs in 
North Carolina. This license and the supporting 
regional stakeholder agreement provide many 
regional benefits and promote smart water 
management practices. 

\ 28 \  DUKE ENERGY  Closing ash basins in ways that protect 
the environment, communities
More than two years following the Dan River coal 
ash release, Duke Energy’s ash management 
work advances on multiple fronts.

Ash basin closure is underway at multiple sites 
across our service territory. In the Carolinas, the 
company began excavating ash at six plant sites 
in 2015 and has relocated more than 1 million 
tons to lined storage solutions. Excavation rates 
will jump dramatically in 2016 now that rail 
infrastructure is in place at multiple sites to safely 
and efficiently move ash.

The North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act, 
passed in 2014, outlines the detailed process 
the company is following to thoroughly study 
groundwater near ash basins, develop closure 
plans based on the unique features of the sites 
and close the basins by aggressive deadlines. 
The company hosted several community 
events for plant neighbors so they could learn 
more in advance of excavation work. The 
North Carolina law also provides several public 
input opportunities throughout the process. 
In December of 2014, EPA finalized the Coal 
Combustion Residuals (CCR) rule, which governs 
the management and disposal of coal ash. Duke 
Energy’s activities comply with all relevant state 
and federal regulations.

Across the rest of our service area, the company 
is in the process of safely closing some ash 
basins, while conducting engineering studies  
to prepare customized closure plans for others. 

At locations where ash is either required to be 
excavated or where science determines that’s 
the best approach, the company looks first 
at relocating ash to landfills on plant property 
before evaluating off-site locations. Duke Energy 
announced in 2015 that it will pursue permitting 
for four new on-site, lined landfills in the 
Carolinas to receive excavated material.

All closure plans will meet requirements of the 
CCR rule and will protect groundwater. As Duke 
Energy continues this important work, it will 
close ash basins in ways that put safety first, 
protect the environment, minimize impact to 
communities and manage costs.

Trees and other large vegetation can cause power 
outages if they fall on or even touch power lines. 
Duke Energy must keep tall vegetation away from 
power lines while protecting wildlife habitat and 
rare plant areas under and around those lines.

Duke Energy’s vegetation management program 
includes the use of environmentally sound 

herbicide application techniques that encourage 
low-growing vegetation for wildlife habitat and 
discourage tall vegetation that could interfere with 
the power lines above.

The herbicides promote non-woody plants such 
as grasses and other native species which provide 
natural habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, 
including wild turkeys, bob white quail and 
pollinators such as bees.

Duke Energy uses herbicides approved by EPA 
and appropriate state agencies, which are similar 
to those products used by homeowners in their 
own yards.

Other vegetation management highlights:

   In the Midwest, Duke Energy works to avoid 
pruning and removing specific tree species, 
such as the shag bark hickory, at times when 
nesting bats might be present.

   In North Carolina, Duke Energy carefully 
coordinates its vegetation management 
activities with the state’s Natural Heritage 
Program to protect rare and threatened plant 
species, such as the Schweinitz’s sunflower.

   Duke Energy engages in research to ensure 

it uses ecologically friendly vegetation 
management practices on all land traversed  
by its power lines – both private property  
and public parcels, such as national parks  
and forests.

“Reliable, 24/7 electric service and sensitive 
environmental protection go hand-in-hand,” 
says Ron Adams, Duke Energy vegetation 
management director.

Legal cases resolved
Duke Energy resolved two legal cases in 2015 
related to environmental issues. Specifically, the 
company reached settlement agreements with:

   The U.S. government to close a federal criminal 
investigation of its subsidiaries – Duke Energy 
Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke 
Energy Business Services – related to the 
2014 Dan River coal ash spill and ash basin 
operations at the company’s other North 
Carolina coal-fired power plants.

   The U.S. government and three environmental 
groups to end litigation against the company for 
alleged federal Clean Air Act violations involving 
maintenance and repair projects at some of 
the company’s coal-fired power plants in North 
Carolina. Duke Energy denied the allegations 
and maintained it complied fully with federal 
law. The company settled the case to avoid the 
cost of prolonged litigation.

Reliability Is A Commitment

Reliable power is one of Duke Energy’s core commitments to our customers – the 
more than 24 million people we serve. We set reliability targets each year for the 
number and duration of power outages and power generation fleet performance.

Power Delivery
We experienced a large number of mid-size storms in 2015 which caused us to miss 
our internal target. However, the longer-term trend in number of outages continues 
to improve.

February 2015, and peak summer loads in June.  

Nuclear fleet capacity factor, which is a measure of generation reliability, improved 
from 93.2 percent in 2014 to 94.2 percent in 2015, and exceeded 90 percent for 
the 17th consecutive year. The regulated fossil/hydro fleet improved commercial 
availability performance from 85.9 percent in 2014 to 87.4 percent in 2015.

The commercial renewables fleet’s commercial availability declined from  
96 percent in 2014 to 93.3 percent in 2015 because of unscheduled  
maintenance activities.

2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 31 /Oconee Nuclear Station

Duke Energy’s nuclear 
stations are running 
better than ever. This 
South Carolina plant  
set records in 2015.

Tanya Hamilton / Harris Nuclear Plant Manager

CLEAN NUCLEAR POWER – RECORD RESULTS

With 11 operating units, Duke Energy has nuclear plants that originally started producing 
power in the 1970s. 

Over the years, including 2015, many of these same plants in North Carolina and South 
Carolina have continuously improved their operations and are now more efficient than ever – 
even producing more electricity than their original design capacity.

In 2015, our nuclear fleet reported a capacity factor of 94.2 percent. This means the 
generating units collectively generated electricity 94.2 percent of the time. That’s the best 
mark in more than a decade and considerably better than the 2015 national average of 
91.9 percent. In contrast, in the 1970s capacity factors were typically below 70 percent.

It also extends the company’s streak for 90-plus percent capacity factors to  
17 consecutive years.

Brunswick, Harris, McGuire and Robinson stations achieved record generation runs  
during 2015 – producing more power in the same time frame than ever before.

Unit 1 of the Catawba Nuclear Station had its longest continuous operating run ever  
in 2015. Not bad for a plant that began producing power in 1985.

Also in 2015, the three-unit Oconee Nuclear Station achieved its highest capacity factor in 
history – 98 percent. And, Oconee had its shortest refueling outage ever. This means the 
Oconee units were on line delivering greenhouse gas emissions-free power to customers 
for most of the year.

And, although the annual radiological dose to workers has always been well below 
established federal limits because of our extensive, ongoing focus on safety, the Duke 
Energy nuclear employees had their lowest fleet annual dose ever in 2015 – creating an 
even safer environment for employees.

Environmental Performance Metrics

Fuels consumed for  
U.S. electric generation
Since 2008, use of coal and oil as generation 
fuels has significantly decreased. These  
have been replaced primarily by natural gas, 
mostly because it has become a relatively 
less expensive fuel and we added natural gas 
generation capacity.

Water withdrawn and consumed
Water withdrawn is the total volume removed 
from a water source, such as a lake or a 
river. Because of the once-through cooling 
systems on many of our coal-fired and nuclear 
plants, more than 98 percent of this water 
is returned to the source and available for 
other uses. Water consumed is the amount 
of water removed for use and not returned to 
the source.

Emissions from generation
Many factors influence emissions levels and 
intensities, including generation diversity and 
efficiency, demand for electricity, weather, 
fuel availability and prices, and emissions 
controls deployed. Since 2005, our U.S. 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased 
by 28 percent, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions 
decreased by 90 percent and nitrogen oxides 
(NOX) emissions decreased by 68 percent. 
These decreases are primarily because of 
the addition of pollution control equipment, 
decreased coal generation, increased natural 
gas generation, and replacement of higher-
emitting plants.

U.S. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
Duke Energy’s TRI releases for 2014 were 
down 71 percent from 2007, primarily due  
to the significant investments we’ve made  
in environmental controls for our power  
plants. (Data for 2015 will be available in 
August 2016.)

Waste
We are on track to meet our goal of increasing 
the percentage of solid waste that is recycled 
from 69 percent in 2013 to 80 percent in 2018. 
(This goal excludes Duke Energy International 
and Duke Energy Renewables.)

Reportable oil spills
Oil spills include releases of lubricating 
oil from generating stations, leaks from 
transformers, or damage caused by weather 
or by third parties (typically because of  
auto accidents).

Environmental regulatory citations
Fines/penalties were relatively large in 2013 
because of the November 2013 settlement 
agreement addressing golden eagle fatalities 
at wind power facilities, and in 2015 because 
of the May 2015 ash enforcement agreement.

  Black Enterprise Magazine named Duke Energy to  

its 40 Best Companies for Diversity.

  Expanded our Quick Fit program – getting more 

employees moving across the company.

Challenges and Opportunities
  Ensure knowledge transfer as our baby boomers retire.

Increase our bench strength by continuing to focus

Preparing the community workforce
Duke Energy knows having a prepared workforce 
is critical to the company – but also to attracting 
new and expanding businesses. 

Investments in community colleges and other 
educational institutions have been a key driver 
for economic growth in Duke Energy’s service 
territories. Graduates offer the technical skills 
needed to fuel a growing economy. 

To ensure students receive the skills needed for 
success, Duke Energy supports workforce training 
through a number of investments in regional 
community colleges. 

For example, the company has provided a 
$250,000 grant to support a budding structural 
design program at Richmond Community College 
in North Carolina. The funds are being used to 
help expand programs in machining, computer-
aided drafting and 3D printing – all needed for an 
expanding industrial base. 

South Carolina’s Spartanburg Community College 
received a grant to expand knowledge in Web 
development – a skillset that is needed in  
the region. 

Gateway Community and Technical College in 
Kentucky is helping teach skills to women to 
pursue careers in fields often dominated by  
men – especially in the manufacturing sector.

BRINGING FITNESS TO EMPLOYEES

For the past few years, Quick Fit has gotten company employees moving and grooving. The 
program focuses on strength training, balance, agility, coordination and cardio fitness. It has 
everyone from line technicians to office workers getting a healthy workout and just having fun. 
For 15 minutes a day, employees gather in various locations around the company to stretch 
and move – helping prevent minor aches, pains and missteps that can lead to lost workdays. 
Program participation kept expanding throughout Duke Energy in 2015 – and is expected to 
continue increasing in 2016.

At Nash Community College in North Carolina, a 
$250,000 grant helps offer training to students 
on precision machinery that’s used by industrial 
customers for various cutting processes.  

Sandhills Community College in North Carolina 
received a $250,000 grant to create an expanded 
state-of-the-art welding program. 

Duke Energy embraces the challenge of preparing 
a workforce that has the specialized skills needed 
for all types of business. That helps us, but it also 
helps the industries we serve. 

A promise to employees
When changes occur that affect employees, 
Duke Energy works hard to help them navigate 
the transition. For Crystal River Nuclear Plant 
employees, February 5, 2013, seemed like the 
end. The decision announced that day to retire 
the plant, known as CR3, after 36 years of 
service left its 600 employees with feelings of 
sadness, apprehension and uncertainty. Now, 
many of those same employees look back on that 
day not as an ending but as a new beginning. 

The day after the announcement, senior company 
leaders met with CR3 employees to listen to 
their concerns and answer their questions. 
Senior leaders made this promise: If you want 
to continue working for Duke Energy, we will 
redeploy as many of you as possible to other 
positions within the company. 

Human Resources staff met with employees one-
on-one to understand their career preferences –  
asking employees whether they wanted to 
stay on site to fill a temporary position on the 
decommissioning team, to redeploy to another 
position within the company or to leave the 
company with severance benefits. In most  
cases, Duke Energy was able to fulfill  
employee preferences.

Duke Energy also held internal job fairs with  
workgroups across the company and hired an 
on-site recruiter to help employees navigate the 
hiring process.

Three years later, Duke Energy has successfully 
placed about two-thirds of the employees affected 
by the decision to retire the nuclear plant. More 
than 300 employees have redeployed to other 
positions within the company, and about  
70 employees – not including security officers 
or contractors – remain on site as part of the 
decommissioning team. Many of the other 
affected employees used this change as an 
opportunity to retire.

Taking an interest, this employee  
made it happen
When you write a big company, who reads it?  
If you’re lucky, Keith McGuinness does.

Julie Nofsinger wrote a letter to Duke Energy’s 
real estate team a few years ago about property 
located at one of our 3,200 substations. 

2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 37 /Julio Gonzalez / Engineering Technologist

USING ART TO FOCUS ON MATH AND SCIENCE CAREERS 

Julio Gonzalez and members of Latinos Energizing Diversity 
(LED), an employee resource group at Duke Energy, wanted  
to do something different for an educational outreach program 
in Charlotte-area schools. 

“We thought, ‘What if we engage students more and combine 
left-brain, right-brain concepts together on a project?’” said 
Gonzalez. The group envisioned a collaboration that involved 
students in a hands-on STEM art project that would have a 
lasting impact on the students. 

LED members subsequently visited three schools – Charlotte’s 
Morehead STEM Academy, Mallard Creek High School and 
Vance High School – where they talked with students about 
various career paths at the company and in the energy industry.

What followed was the creation of large murals by the students 
demonstrating various aspects of STEM. 

With the help of a Duke Energy Foundation grant,  
30 enthusiastic students from each school – chosen by 
principals and teachers – worked independently to illustrate 
an aspect of STEM on 8.5-by-11-inch pieces of paper. 
The illustrations were then put on large vinyl stickers and 
assembled into three large murals – one at each school.

The finished pieces show a wide range of topics related to 
energy, from battery storage to renewable power. 

“The project helps further STEM education, but it goes well 
beyond that,” said Gonzalez. “It gives students an opportunity 
to solve real-life problems and helps to build pride in  
their school.” 

Would the company work with a local garden 
association on a community garden project?

McGuinness knew the site well. The 0.22 acres 
the garden group was interested in held no future 
plans for the company. He decided to take action –  
just like many employees, who are helping 
communities throughout our regions.

Today, underneath a large transmission power 
line, tomatoes, peppers, squash and cucumbers 
are just a few of the plants growing. It’s a nice 
outlet for neighbors, whose shady yards made 
growing vegetables difficult.

Launched in June 2015, the 36 plots at the 
garden are fully subscribed – and neighbors are 
waiting for openings.

McGuinness says he hopes the company  
can work with other community groups on  
similar projects.

“Every piece of property is not the same, and 
every project might not be the right fit for the 
company,” he said. “But there is no reason  
why we can’t do more projects like this.”

Besides a dose of goodwill, Duke Energy also 
benefits since the group clears the underbrush  
around the site, helping Duke Energy avoid  
future landscaping needs.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
Cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information
This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities 
Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are 
based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases that 
include “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “continue,” “should,” “could,” “may,” 
“plan,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “potential,” “forecast,” “target,” “guidance,” “outlook” or other similar 
terminology. Various factors may cause actual results to be materially different than the suggested outcomes 
within forward-looking statements; accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be realized. 
These factors include, but are not limited to: state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, 
including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements or climate change, as 
well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market 
prices; the extent and timing of costs and liabilities to comply with federal and state laws, regulations, and 
legal requirements related to coal ash remediation, including amounts for required closure of certain ash 
impoundments, are uncertain and difficult to estimate; the ability to recover eligible costs, including amounts 
associated with coal ash mitigation such as coal ash impoundment retirement obligations and cost related to 
significant weather events, and earn an adequate return on investment through the regulatory process; the 
costs of decommissioning Crystal River Unit 3 and other nuclear facilities could prove to be more extensive 
than amounts estimated and all costs may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process; credit 
ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants may be different from what is expected; costs and effects of legal and 
administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; industrial, commercial and residential 
growth or decline in service territories or customer bases resulting from variations in customer usage 
patterns, including energy efficiency efforts and use of alternative energy sources, including self-generation 
and distributed generation technologies; federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to 
promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measures and distributed generation technologies, such 
as rooftop solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in customers leaving 
the electric distribution system, excess generation resources as well as stranded costs; advancements 
in technology; additional competition in electric markets and continued industry consolidation; political, 
economic and regulatory uncertainty in Brazil and other countries in which Duke Energy conducts business; 
the influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, operational 
and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes; the ability to 
successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers including direct or 
indirect effects to the company resulting from an incident that affects the U.S. electric grid or generating 
resources; the impact on facilities and business from a terrorist attack, cybersecurity threats, data security 
breaches, and other catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, pandemic health events or other similar 
occurrences; the inherent risks associated with the operation and potential construction of nuclear facilities, 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Duke Energy’s 2015 Sustainability Report references 2015, 2014 and 2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share 
(EPS) of $4.54, $4.55 and $4.36, respectively.
Management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted 
earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. These items are measured as income from continuing operations net 
of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of 
mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment and special items including 
the operating results of the nonregulated Midwest generation business and Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC 
(Disposal Group) sold to Dynegy Inc., classified as discontinued operations for GAAP purposes. Special 
items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular 
basis, although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. Management believes that 
including the operating results of the Disposal Group reported as Discontinued operations better reflects its 
financial performance and therefore has included these results in adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS 
prior to the sale of the Disposal Group. Additionally, as a result of completing the sale of the Disposal Group 
during the second quarter of 2015, state income tax expense increased as state income tax apportionments 
changed. The additional tax expense was recognized in Continuing Operations on a GAAP basis. This impact 
to state income taxes has been excluded from the Commercial Portfolio segment for adjusted diluted EPS 
purposes as management believes these impacts are incidental to the sale of the Disposal Group. Derivative 
contracts are used in Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in 
the Commercial Portfolio segment. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP 
earnings immediately and, if associated with the Disposal Group, classified as discontinued operations, as 
such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value 
of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output 
commodities (e.g., coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of 
those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are 
accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes 
of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the 
derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes 
the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it 
provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management 
uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the Duke 
Energy Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke Energy’s 
financial performance. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The 
most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income 
Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common 
stockholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of 
economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment and discontinued operations.

Adjusted Diluted EPS Outlook
Duke Energy’s 2015 Sustainability Report also references the growth range for 2016 to 2020 of 4 to 6 
percent in adjusted diluted EPS (on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis). Adjusted diluted EPS is 
a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Duke 
Energy Corporation stockholders, adjusted for the per share impact of special items and the mark-to-market 
impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment (as discussed above under Adjusted Diluted 
EPS). Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure for future periods, information 
to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as 
management is unable to project all special items or mark-to-market adjustments for future periods.

including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks; the timing and extent of changes in 
commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the ability to recover such costs 
through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on liquidity positions and the value of 
underlying assets; the results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, 
which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations and general 
economic conditions; declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities and resultant 
cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans, and 
nuclear decommissioning trust funds; construction and development risks associated with the completion 
of Duke Energy Registrants’ capital investment projects, including risks related to financing, obtaining and 
complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules, and satisfying operating 
and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a 
timely manner or at all; changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate 
designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by the default of 
other participants; the ability to control operation and maintenance costs; the level of creditworthiness of 
counterparties to transactions; employee workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and 
retain key personnel; the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to Duke Energy Corporation 
holding company (the Parent); the performance of projects undertaken by our nonregulated businesses and 
the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities; the effect of accounting pronouncements 
issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; the impact of potential goodwill impairments; the 
ability to reinvest prospective undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries or repatriate such earnings on a 
tax-efficient basis; the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the proposed acquisition of Piedmont 
Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont), including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required 
governmental and regulatory approvals of the proposed acquisition that could reduce anticipated benefits or 
cause the parties to abandon the acquisition, and under certain specified circumstance pay a termination fee 
of $250 million, as well as the ability to successfully integrate the businesses and realize anticipated benefits 
and the risk that the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what 
the companies expect; and the ability to successfully complete future merger, acquisition or divestiture plans. 
Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in the Duke Energy Registrants’ reports filed 
with the SEC and available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In light of these risks, uncertainties and 
assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a 
different extent or at a different time than described. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date 
they are made; the Duke Energy Registrants expressly disclaim an obligation to publicly update or revise any 
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
