Overview

A message from our CEO

Our value as a company has always rested on 
providing safe, reliable and affordable power, day 
in and day out. That commitment is unwavering, 
but how we deliver on it is changing. 

company. It’s the execution of our clean energy 
strategy and focus on our enduring purpose 
that will allow us to grow and create an even 
greater impact.

Our clean energy transition continues to deliver 
consistent and lasting benefits to our customers, 
communities and investors. And the impact is 
significant. We’ll invest $145 billion over the next 
decade to fund the critical energy infrastructure 
necessary to meet customers’ needs and support 
our path to net-zero.

An EY study found this planned investment 
will lead to $250 billion in economic output 
throughout the U.S. economy. It will also generate 
approximately $5 billion in property taxes over 
the next 10 years to support schools, community 
programs and infrastructure, and support 20,000 
direct and indirect jobs annually. 

And despite this tumultuous time – rising interest 
rates and inflation, high commodity prices, supply 
chain disruptions, and a war abroad – value 
creation remains front and center for our 

Ambition. Action. Results. 

The following pages provide a snapshot of where 
we are on our path to net-zero. 

We are maintaining a responsible pace of change 
as we undertake the nation’s largest clean energy 
transition to preserve affordability and reliability. 

The report details our targets and progress, as 
well as the generation transition underway and 
the emerging technologies we’re pursuing.  

It also outlines our corporate citizenship and 
the benefits to our employees, customers 
and communities we serve – from economic 
development to environmental justice to a just 
transition that includes reskilling and redeploying 
workers and helping ensure none of our 
communities are left behind.

I also want to stress our commitment to affordability and 
energy equity. 

We work hard to keep rates affordable and will continue 
to do so for all customers – from our industrial clients who 
are competing globally to residential customers who are 
struggling to pay their bills.

I’m proud that we’ve been able to connect customers 
to more than $300 million in energy assistance over 
the past two years. And we continue to work alongside 
stakeholders to introduce new programs and policies that 
will generate savings and lower the cost of the transition.

2022 Achievements 

Over the last year, we made great progress advancing our 
strategy and delivering value, including: 

	 Expanded our net-zero goals to include Scope 2 and 

certain Scope 3 emissions, becoming one of the first in 
the industry to tie more than 95% of emissions to a net-
zero commitment.

	 Established a goal to exit coal by 2035 subject to 

regulatory approval, and plan to have less than 5% of 
generation from coal by 2030.

	 Announced plans to add regulated renewables at a 

record rate – 30,000 megawatts by 2035, which is  
five times more than is on the system today.

	 Advocated for policies that align with our focus to 
deliver affordable, reliable and increasingly clean 
energy, including the Inflation Reduction Act. We expect 
to qualify for a variety of nuclear, solar, and other 
renewable credits that will generate billions in savings 
over the next decade. 

	 Continued to pursue Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act opportunities to help develop and deploy new zero-
emitting load-following resources. 

	 Filed our first proposed Carbon Plan with the North 
Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), incorporating 
input from more than 500 stakeholders and outlining 
multiple portfolios designed to achieve some of the 
most ambitious goals in the nation while balancing 
affordability and reliability. In December, we received a 
constructive order from the NCUC, recognizing the value 
of an all-of-the-above approach.  

	 Continued to modernize the grid and increase reliability 
and resiliency, including the approval of a $2 billion, 
six-year Transmission, Distribution and Storage System 
Improvement Charge plan in Indiana and a $7 billion, 
10-year storm protection plan in Florida. 

	 Donated more than $52 million to support our local 
communities, focusing on our core pillars of giving 
– creating vibrant communities, advancing climate 
resiliency and furthering justice, equity and inclusion. 

	 Introduced just transition principles around four key 
areas – workforce, communities, customers and 
economic development – to guide our clean energy 
transition and identify opportunities and needs that 
could arise. 

	 Provided more than 20 community college programs 
over $1.4 million in grants to deepen our pipeline of 
talent and meet our future workforce energy needs.

Our Commitment to You

As this report makes clear, the 27,000 employees at  
Duke Energy are aligned in our ambition to achieve our 
net-zero goals. We are taking collective action to transform 
and ready the system for a zero-carbon future and are 
producing the results you expect of us.  

As we advance the transition, we’ll continue to work 
across stakeholder groups, industries and sectors 
to deliver the best outcomes for our customers and 
communities and help decarbonize the nation in a 
responsible way.

2022 Impact Report 5

A message from our CSPO

2022 was a year we made progress on our path 
to net-zero and can be summed up with three 
words, “ambition, action and results,” which 
makes it a fitting theme for this year’s flagship 
Impact Report. 

Our business strategy is creating value for our 
employees, customers and communities while at 
the same time mitigating the risks associated with 
our business. We believe in a balanced pace of 
change and are committed to a future that offers 
reliable, accessible and affordable clean energy 
for all customers and areas we serve. Achieving 
this vision requires us to transition to low- and 
zero-emissions energy, invest in our communities, 
and develop and prepare a diverse workforce. 

Affordability continues to be top of mind for us as 
we look for ways to continue to aid our customers 
and communities in need. In addition to the 
components Lynn laid out, we’re pursuing the 
opportunities provided by the Inflation Reduction 
Act (IRA), whose significant tax incentives for 
carbon-free resources will help enable a more 
affordable energy transition for our customers. 

Customers will directly benefit from the IRA.  
And we’re excited about the opportunities to 
reduce costs affiliated with grid improvements 
and clean energy technologies available through 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 

We continue to evolve forward and focus on the 
sustainability issues that are the most relevant 
to our business and stakeholders, and where we 
have the best opportunity to make the biggest 
impact. Our priorities center on the clean energy 
transition and fall into three priority areas:

	 Climate and resiliency

	 Social impact

	 Governance and integrity

Key highlights in this year’s report include:

Our clean energy transition: For our part, we 
have retired 56 coal units since 2010 and 
reduced our carbon emissions from electricity 
generation by 44% from 2005 levels. And are 
on pace to achieve our goal of at least 50% 
reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 from 
electricity generation and net-zero methane 
emissions from our natural gas business by

2022 Impact Report 6

Trust starts with transparency, and our Impact Report is 
one way we provide our stakeholders with insight into our 
practices so they can chart our progress and help hold 
us accountable. In this year’s report, we included several 
voluntary disclosures including our Trade Association 
Climate Review as well as alignment to the Sustainable 
Accounting Standards Board, Global Reporting Initiative 
and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 

Stakeholder engagement is foundational to our business 
success, and we look forward to working together on a 
brighter and more equitable energy future! 

2030. Last year, we took additional steps toward action 
on climate change by targeting energy generated by coal 
to represent less than 5% of total generation by 2030 
and to fully exit coal by 20351 as part of the largest 
planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. Also, we set 
interim net-zero targets and expanded our goals to address 
upstream and downstream emissions for both our electric 
and natural gas business.

people of color and increased our aspirational goal to 
23%. We are actively recruiting from historically Black 
colleges and universities, with a cross-function team 
dedicated to fostering engagement and partnerships. For 
our existing workforce, we provide multiskilling training, 
short-term development opportunities across the company 
and resources to help employees take charge of their 
career development.

Economic development: The energy sector must 
transition for tomorrow in a way that also benefits society 
today. Our economic development team continues to 
be successful in attracting growing companies to the 
communities we serve. In 2022 alone, the team secured 
89 projects resulting in more than 29,000 new jobs 
and over $23 billion in capital investments. In addition, 
our supply chain spend is also an important avenue to 
strengthening local economies. Last year we spent $14 
billion overall on supplier goods and services, more than 
$5 billion with local suppliers and over $1.8 billion with 
diverse suppliers.

Human capital management: Our workforce strategy is 
centered around attracting the best talent, reflecting the 
communities we serve and helping workers thrive in a 
dynamic and constantly evolving industry. We are working 
to increase diversity across all workforce segments. For 
example, in 2022 we reached our workforce goal of 20% 

Environmental justice and the just transition: Our long-
term success is deeply intertwined with the health and 
well-being of the communities we serve. In 2022, we 
integrated our environmental justice principles into our 
due diligence process for siting to help us make informed 
decisions for both our business and communities. 
We do this through a systematic assessment process 
and dialogue with community leaders. Last year, we 
conducted initial environmental assessments on more 
than 55 sites and prioritized engagement accordingly. 
And, as we navigate the largest planned coal retirement in 
the industry, we are meaningfully addressing the impacts 
to workers and communities. In 2022, we engaged a 
third party to perform an assessment of our upcoming 
and near-term coal retirements, noting community 
demographics, plant specifics and adjacent employment 
opportunities. This work helped inform our just transition 
principles and framework.

Our ESG Approach

We provide reliable, affordable, increasingly clean 
energy today. We envision a future that continues to 
provide reliable, affordable energy to all customers 
while transitioning to low- and zero-emission 
technologies and fuel sources as we work toward our 
goals of net-zero methane emissions by 2030 and 
net-zero Scope 1, 2 and certain Scope 3 greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2050. At the same time, we are 
investing in the resilience of our operations and our 
communities and developing and preparing a diverse 
workforce that will thrive in a constantly evolving 
world. And we are doing this while working to ensure 
safety for our employees and customers. We recognize 
that we can’t achieve our ambitious goals solely 
on our own – we will continue to work alongside 
policymakers, industry peers and others to achieve our 
vision and deliver long-term value for our customers, 
investors and other stakeholders.

Key Stakeholder Issues & ESG Priorities

The Importance of Our Stakeholders 

Stakeholder engagement is foundational to our 
success. We are committed to a future that offers 
reliable, accessible and affordable clean energy for 
all customers and areas we serve and to making a 
positive impact on our communities. This requires 
that we consider the needs and concerns of a diverse 
stakeholder audience, which includes customers, 
shareholders, regulators, environmental organizations, 
social advocates, community agencies, elected 
officials, employees and many others. Doing so 
requires that we get their perspectives early and often 
and work together to develop and deliver smart energy 

solutions. We engage and interact (both virtually and 
in person). We hold open houses. We listen before 
we act.

Customers: Access to affordable, reliable and 
increasingly clean energy

Communities: Collaborative partners in creating 
stronger, more inclusive and vibrant economies

Suppliers: Collaborators in the clean 
energy transition

Investors: Delivering long-term returns and 
transparent disclosures through financial 
discipline and leadership

Employees and Alumni: Creating opportunities 
and mission-driven work 

Policymakers: Critical to ensuring balanced 
public policy helps drive change for climate 
action in a way that maintains reliability and 
affordability for customers 

NGOs (non-governmental organizations): 
Provide feedback on sustainability-related issues 
and priorities and help hold us accountable 

Thought Leaders: Key to communicating the 
clean energy transition and different dimensions 
that matter to other relevant stakeholders

ESG Priority Assessment

Duke Energy’s approach to ESG focuses on the 
issues that are most relevant to our business and 
stakeholders, and where we have the best opportunity 
to make the biggest impact. Our ESG priority 
assessment helps us determine these issues and we

update this assessment periodically. In 2022, in addition to our outreach as in the past to community members, 
investors and NGOs, we also used artificial intelligence technology to help us assess trends in external stakeholder 
interests. We then collected internal feedback through a variety of methods including surveys with company 
leaders to assess top business priorities. Topics ranking higher with our stakeholders generate greater outside 
engagement and more frequent communication.

We recognize the dynamic nature of ESG topics over time, and as part of our ongoing governance, we continuously 
monitor pressing and emerging relevant issues and current events. Our current ESG Priority Topics are listed 
below and organized into three primary areas; Climate & Resiliency, Social Impact and Governance & Integrity. 
Additionally, our ESG priorities are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

2050

Reduce Scope 3 emissions from power purchased for resale to net-
zero by 2050

In 2022, CO2 emissions were marginally higher than in 2021 
due to increased generation from fossil assets due to increased 
customer demand for electricity. We anticipate that in the 
future, remaining fossil units will run off of zero-emitting 
resources, such as hydrogen or biofuels, and have pilot 
programs currently underway.

We decreased our Scope 2 emissions by 1,000 metric tons 
in 2022. 

Our Scope 3 emissions increased due to a rise in generation 
from fossil assets driven by increases in customer demand 
for electricity.

The increase is driven by growth in purchased power to 
satisfy customer demand. As a leader in the clean energy 
transition, we continue to share best practices of our own 
emissions reduction efforts to help enable our peers to meet 
decarbonization goals. 

2050

Reduce Scope 3 upstream CO2 and methane emissions from 
purchased natural gas to net-zero by 2050

Our Scope 3 upstream CO2 and methane emissions from 
purchased gas decreased as a result of supplier improvements 
in methane reduction efforts and improved emissions reporting. 

2050

Reduce Scope 3 downstream emissions from customer use of 
natural gas to net-zero by 2050

Scope 3 emissions from customer use of natural gas increased 
due to expansion of our natural gas customer base.

The energy sector must transition for tomorrow in a way that 
also benefits society today. For our part, we are leading our 
industry by our net-zero goals that address 95% of our Scope 
1, 2 and 3 calculated greenhouse gas footprint. Our net-zero 
goal for carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050 
and net-zero goal for methane emissions by 2030 serve as our 
North Stars, guiding our actions. And we have interim targets – 
80% reduction in our Scope 1 carbon emissions from electricity 
generation by 2040 and 50% reduction for Scope 2 and 
certain Scope 3 by 2035. We will achieve these transformative 
goals by expanding new and existing energy technologies and 
by collaborating with policymakers, industry peers and external 
partners on how best to meet this challenge.

Clean Energy Transition

U.S. electric utilities have led the way in GHG 
emissions reductions. Since 2005, our sector has 
reduced carbon emissions by nearly 40% while 
emissions from most other economic sectors in the 
U.S. have remained generally flat or have increased 
with economic growth. The power sector plays a key 
role in helping adjacent sectors meet their own net-
zero objectives. Duke Energy is ahead of the industry 
average, with a 44% reduction in carbon emissions 
from electricity generation since 2005.

We approach the clean energy transition in a balanced 
way that is attuned to reliability and customer 
affordability. We are making investments to lower fuel 
costs and reduce price volatility, taking advantage of 
clean energy tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction 
Act (IRA) and working to receive funding for innovative 
technologies through the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act (IIJA), and will continue to focus on 
near- and long-term cost management. 

With our continued focus on customers, cost 
management and job creation, we engaged Ernst & 
Young (EY) to evaluate the economic benefits of our 
planned 10-year $145 billion capital investment. Their 
findings estimate that our investment will support 
20,000 additional jobs nationwide annually during 

that period and produce $250 billion in economic 
output throughout the U.S. economy due to jobs, 
income paid to workers, and payments made to 
suppliers. In addition, it will generate over $5 billion 
in additional property tax revenue over the next 10 
years to support schools, first responders, roads 
and other infrastructure and essential services in our 
local communities.

All of this amounts to one of the largest clean energy 
transitions in our industry. We intend to invest over 
$145 billion in capital between 2023 and 2032, 
of which approximately 85% will support the clean 
energy transition and our goal to become net-zero 
by 2050. Of this, we will invest approximately $75 
billion to modernize and strengthen the nation’s 
largest investor-owned electric grid. We are working 
to promote a just transition and to ensure our clean 
energy efforts promote economic growth through 
investments in our communities. We will invest 
another $40 billion in zero-carbon generation, 
including nuclear, solar, wind and battery storage 
resources, and will also invest in extending the life of 
our carbon-free nuclear fleet. 

For our operational footprint, we are well positioned 
to exceed our Scope 1 2030 goal of a 50% reduction 
in carbon emissions from electricity generation from 
2005 levels and in 2022 established a second interim 
target of an 80% reduction in 2040. We are leading 
our industry by addressing 95% of our Scope 1, 2 and 
3 calculated greenhouse gas footprint. That means

we’re reducing emissions across the full value chain of our business, all the 
way from raw material inputs through our own operations and downstream 
to customer use. That’s over 100 million metric tons of GHG per year over 
the next 30 years that we plan to get to net-zero. For emissions beyond 
our direct control, or Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, we have analyzed 
the totality of our value chain and brought in a third party to validate our 
work. Based upon that analysis, we established a goal of a 50% reduction 
by 2035.

Maintaining reliability through this transition is critical. For example, over 
the past five years, infrastructure upgrades avoided more than 1.4 million 
extended customer outages, saving more than 7.2 million hours of total lost 
outage time for Duke Energy customers.

Governing the Clean Energy Transition 

Our energy transition strategy is embedded across all areas of our 
business. Our Enterprise Strategy team oversees the implementation of our 
clean energy transition, working across our various jurisdictions in a way 
that shapes the landscape, transforms our systems and creates value for 
customers and shareholders. 

The strategy team works closely with our finance and planning teams, 
policy teams and state presidents' organizations to develop and execute 
integrated resource plans. The Enterprise Strategy Execution Committee 
meets monthly and is comprised of business unit leaders, the corporate 
strategy team, Senior Management Committee and jurisdictional 
leadership. This committee reports progress annually during a strategy 
session with the Board of Directors.

Duke Energy is employing a number of strategies 
to reduce Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions 
by 50% by 2035 including shifting our generation 
mix, including an exit from coal, to reduce the 
emissions affiliated with extraction, production and 
transportation of fossil fuels. We continue to share 
best practices of our own decarbonization in an 

effort to help enable our peers and suppliers to meet 
their own net-zero goals. In addition, we support the 
implementation of customer programs, such as energy 
efficiency and weatherization. To better address Scope 
3 emissions from our customers' use of natural gas, 
we developed emission offset programs and plan 
to increase the utilization of renewable natural gas 
in our local distribution companies (LDCs). Lastly, 
we continue to work with our upstream natural gas 
suppliers through efforts like ONE Future to help 
reduce emissions across the natural gas value chain.

Enterprise GWh

Additional goals include the following:

	 In North Carolina, we are planning to fulfill the clean energy 
legislation targeting 70% carbon reduction by 2030 and net-
zero emissions by 2050 goals outlined by North Carolina’s 
clean energy legislation, which was signed into law in 
October 2021, balancing customer affordability and reliability.

	 Subject to regulatory approval, we aim to reduce energy from 
coal to less than 5% of our total generation by 2030 and to 
fully exit coal by 2035.1

Diverse Energy Mix is Key to Progress

We believe a diverse generation energy mix is key to 
achieving reliability and rate stability as we complete our 
energy transition. Duke Energy is leading the largest planned 
retirement of coal in the nation, pending regulatory approval, 
and anticipates retiring 16 GW of coal by 2035.

Investing in Clean Technologies

Carbon-free dispatchable resources – like hydrogen – are 
essential to achieving our ambitious emission reduction goals.3 
We are working to develop hydrogen- and biogas-capable gas 
turbines, and the first solar-to-hydrogen-fired turbine in Florida.4 
The first-of-its-kind U.S. pilot will produce up to 100% green 
hydrogen from an existing solar facility and we expect it to be 
operational in 2024.

We are supporting, along with other stakeholders, the Green 
Hydrogen Coalition’s HyBuild™ Carolinas initiative, which will 
study and develop a road map for green hydrogen in North 
Carolina and South Carolina’s environment and economy.  
Duke Energy is uniquely positioned in the Carolinas, with a 
strong base of carbon-free nuclear energy and fast-growing 
renewables that can contribute to hydrogen production.

We have a clear line of sight into how we can achieve 
approximately 70% of our carbon goal by using technologies 
that are available today. For the remaining portion, innovation 
is essential. We are pursuing innovative partnerships and 
technologies to help provide clean energy to customers. 

In the Southeast, we are working with other utilities to support 
a hydrogen hub and pursuing federal funding from the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE). DOE expects to award six to 10 
regional hydrogen hubs across the U.S. with $8 billion provided 
as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Zero-emitting Load-following Resources 

To meet our 2050 goal, we estimate that we need over 40,000 
MW of new dispatchable zero-emitting load-following resources 
(ZELFRs). ZELFRs can include small new nuclear, including 

The chart on the right, based on analyses presented in our

We are proud to be part of Energy Pathways 
USA, in partnership with the global Energy 
Transitions Commission, housed at  
Duke University. This work brings together 
leaders across multiple industries to 
accelerate net-zero progress in the  
United States by analyzing quantitative 
and qualitative research on future climate 
scenarios, with the goal of strengthening  
our understanding of what it will take to 
achieve a net-zero future.5

In the Carolinas, where the average CO2 intensity of 
Duke Energy’s electricity is 36% below the national 
average, we filed our proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan 
with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). 
The plan provides a foundation for upcoming state 
regulatory processes to consider. By 2035, the clean 
energy transition would include:

	 More than three times the current level of solar

	 Diversification of renewables with wind resources

	 Significant growth in energy storage – 3,700 MW to 

5,900 MW to support renewables

	 Initial deployments of SMRs to help enable 

coal retirements and steps toward transitioning 
natural gas infrastructure to hydrogen or other 
emerging fuels

As part of this plan, more than 500 individuals 
representing over 300 organizations from both North 
Carolina and South Carolina participated in the 
stakeholder engagement process.6

In December 2022, the NCUC issued an order 
adopting its initial Carbon Plan, which included a set 
of near-term actions to support meeting the state's 
carbon reduction goals. This is a constructive outcome 
that advances our clean energy transition, supporting 
a diverse, all-of-the-above approach that is essential 
for long-term resource planning.

We continue to advance our work with stakeholders 
in other jurisdictions as well. In 2022 in Indiana, 
we held public stakeholder engagement sessions 
and ultimately presented an updated IRP analysis, 
including a new preferred portfolio. The updated IRP 
analysis will be used in 2023 to support certificate of 
public convenience and necessity (CPCN) requests at 
the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) for 
new generating resources.

Justice and the Just Transition sections.

Expanding Renewables

Over the next decade, Duke Energy will make targeted investments 
in solar power plants, battery storage technology, community solar 
programs, wind energy and a modernized power grid to integrate 
renewables – all to help meet customers’ needs for cleaner, diverse, 
reliable energy solutions.7

Decarbonization in the near term depends on the growth of 
renewable energy over the next decade.8 Transitioning to renewables 
will also reduce future fuel requirements, increasing rate stability.9 
By 2035, we expect to have 30,000 megawatts (MW) of regulated 
renewables in our system, including utility-owned renewables and 
renewables procured under purchased power agreements:10

	 Duke Energy has completed 300 MW of solar installations 

in Florida in 2022, and it is on track to provide about 1,500 
MW of emission-free solar generation in the state by the end 
of 2024.

	 In the Carolinas, we continue to grow our solar portfolio with 

more than 4,500 MW of solar capacity connected to our grid, 
including company-owned and independent projects. 

	 Duke Energy Renewable Wind acquired the rights for the 

Carolina Long Bay area east of Wilmington, North Carolina, 
supporting the development of up to 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of 
offshore wind.

	 Duke Energy also proposed programs to allow South Carolina 

customers the option of switching their energy usage to 
100% renewable power.11

In 2022, Duke Energy began a strategic review of its 
Commercial Renewables business and came to the decision 
to pursue a sale allowing us to focus on significant investment 
opportunities within our regulated operations. We anticipate 
exiting the business in the second half of 2023.

Natural Gas Transition Plan

As we transition our power generation energy portfolio, natural 
gas helps ensure reliability and enables us to accelerate the 
retirement of our coal fleet, while adding more renewables. 
Natural gas helps provide flexibility and adaptability to 
quickly dispatch reliable, affordable energy under challenging 

circumstances, such as extreme weather events. Our planned 
transition to cleaner energy will be facilitated by continuously 
evaluating our generation mix and in the first stages, by, in 
part, replacing coal plants with hydrogen cofiring-capable 
natural gas combined-cycle plants. Over time, we expect to be 
able to transition our remaining natural gas generation to burn 
increasingly clean fuels, like green hydrogen and renewable 
natural gas.

In 2022, in conjunction with Purdue University, we advanced 
new ways to use natural gas with reduced carbon emissions. 
We worked together to develop a combined heat and power 
(CHP) turbine on the Purdue campus. The CHP turbine 
captures and uses steam created by Duke Energy’s natural gas-
powered plant, providing Purdue’s heating and hot water, while 
our customers benefit from local power generation, improved 
grid stability and reliability. The system is projected to reduce 
carbon emissions by approximately 50,000 tons and was 
recognized as the 2022 CHP Project of the Year by the  
CHP Alliance.12

Modernizing the Grid

Our $75 billion investment in our grid – the nation’s largest 
investor-owned grid – will modernize and strengthen it to 
connect renewables, improve reliability and resiliency and help 
protect it from cybersecurity and physical threats.

support advancing technologies like electric vehicles (EVs), 
community and utility-scale solar, and battery storage. Our 
smart grid currently monitors thousands of sensors and 
automatically manages the dynamic ebbs and flows from these 
distributed energy sources. As adoption of these technologies 
expands, power will flow in the multiple directions necessary for 
advanced technologies.

In 2022, we announced a collaboration with Amazon Web 
Services (AWS) to deploy new smart grid services and software, 
and to expand intelligent grid services. This technology matches 
the anticipated future energy needs of specific sections of the 
grid against existing load capacity so we can make data-driven 
investments to support real-time grid operations with quality 
and reliability.13

During one of the most powerful and destructive storms in U.S. 
history, Hurricane Ian, Duke Energy mobilized 20,000 people 
working around the clock to restore power to over 2 million 
customers across Florida and the Carolinas. As a result of our 
strong preparation and our grid hardening investments, we were 
able to restore 99% of our customers within 72 hours.

of high demand.14 Storage technology ranges from 
traditional hydroelectric pumped storage to new 
technologies for battery storage. Our focus continues 
to be on long-duration energy storage that includes 
evaluating the potential for increased pumped-
storage capacity and facilitating the advancement of 
battery storage.

Current existing pumped storage located at Bad Creek 
is able to produce enough energy to power nearly 1 
million homes. Bad Creek Project provides emissions-
free hydroelectric power to Duke Energy customers 
across its Carolinas service area. One of the largest 
generating facilities on Duke Energy’s system, it 
operates like a massive battery – quickly generating 
or storing power in response to electricity supply 
and demand.

In addition, today we have approximately 100 MW 
of battery storage in service or under construction. 
As we look to the future, we are planning for over 
10,000 MW of energy storage capacity by 2035 and 
projecting nearly 30,000 MW of energy storage by 
2050. Our approach is to enhance our long-serving 
hydroelectric assets, actively deploy battery energy 
storage technologies available today and support the 
development of advanced energy storage options so 
they can be utilized in the future. In 2022, we worked 
on a variety of pilots and projects to advance energy 
and battery storage technology including:

	 Completed two new lithium-ion battery sites in 
Florida to enhance grid operations, including 18 

MW of battery storage capacity and an additional 
50 MW pilot approved by the Florida Public Service 
Commission, increasing efficiencies and improving 
overall reliability for surrounding communities.15

	 Tested the Eos Zynth Gen 3.0 zinc-bromine battery 
after successfully testing the Gen 2.0 battery in 
2021. This chemistry can handle multiple charges 
and discharges per day and can operate 24/7.

	 Currently installing the GKN Hydrogen generation, 

storage, and electricity production unit. This 
project, which will begin testing in 2023, consists 
of an electrolyzer, H2 storage, and fuel cell in one 
containerized solution.

	 Testing the Honeywell flow battery at the Battery 

Innovation Center, which will extend battery 
storage from four hours up to 12 hours for lithium-
ion batteries.

	 Began testing the EnerVenue, Inc. long duration 
battery at our McAlpine Creek Substation to 
determine capacity and gain an understanding of 
how to use nickel-hydrogen chemistry, which has 
been used with batteries in space for years and has 
been shown to operate in extreme temperatures, 
while boasting the longest life of any battery system.

	 We also completed construction on an 11-MW 

battery in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to support 
grid flexibility and reliability. 

	 Also in the Carolinas, the NCUC approved near-term 
actions to develop and procure 1,000 MW of stand-
alone storage by 2030 with 600 MW of storage 
co-located with solar. We will be conducting the 
following actions to advance this battery storage:

	• submit interconnect requests;

	• test and study non-lithium technologies at R&D 

scale; and

	• design controls, dispatch and software tools 
for a fleet of battery energy storage systems, 
and finalize the procurement strategy and 
initiate procurement activities relative to 
procurement strategy.

Advanced Nuclear & Small Modular Reactors

Advanced nuclear describes the next generation of 
reactor technologies that have significant potential to 
perform as zero-emitting load-following resources.  
The new generation of advanced nuclear provides 
many safety features inherent in their design.  
Duke Energy continues to closely monitor leading 
reactor technologies and partner with TerraPower and 
GE Hitachi on development of an advanced reactor 
integrating energy storage via a molten salt system in 
a first-of-its-kind project.

Another nuclear technology we are evaluating is 
light-water cooled small modular reactors (SMRs) that 

16  Climate Report 2022.pdf, p. 28.

are similar to the nuclear fleet operating today. We 
anticipate that SMRs will play an important role in 
decarbonization in the Carolinas and across the U.S. 
The Department of Energy’s approval of one of these, 
the NuScale design, is yet another positive trend. 
We are evaluating all available SMR designs and will 
choose the option most complementary to our system 
and that best aligns with our goal to reach net-zero 
carbon emissions from electricity generation.

Consistent with the NCUC's Carbon Plan Order, we 
will seek Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for 
the first SMR in the Carolinas and are working with 
multiple SMR vendors to support technology selection.

Existing Nuclear

Duke Energy operates the largest regulated nuclear 
fleet in the nation, and carbon-free nuclear already 
provides approximately 50% of our energy in the 
Carolinas. We believe that the continued safe 
operation of our existing nuclear generation and 
adding new SMRs, combined with other advanced 
nuclear technologies, are essential to our emissions 
reduction progress and to achieving net-zero carbon 
emissions from electricity generation.16

The 11 existing Duke Energy-operated nuclear units 
provide dependable capacity and are the company’s 
largest source of carbon-free generation.

	 Our nuclear fleet reached a capacity factor of 93.7% 
in 2022, marking the 24th consecutive year with a 
fleet capacity factor greater than 90%.

	 In 2022, approximately 81% of Duke Energy’s 

Methane Detection and Reduction

carbon-free generation was from nuclear energy, 
and about 33% of our total generation was from 
nuclear energy.

	 The Duke Energy nuclear fleet generated more 

than 73 billion hours of electricity and avoided the 
release of 49 million tons of carbon dioxide, which 
equates to the removal of approximately 7 million 
cars from the road.

In 2021, we applied to the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission for a license renewal for the Oconee 
Nuclear Station, to keep this carbon-free energy 
source running for an additional 20 years. We plan 
to pursue similar license renewals for each of our 
remaining eight nuclear units.17

Natural Gas Utility 

Decarbonizing the Natural Gas System 

Our goals for our natural gas local distribution 
companies (LDC) are to achieve net-zero Scope 1 
methane emissions by 2030, as well as, by 2050, 
net-zero CO2 and methane emissions for Scope 3 
emissions from upstream purchased gas and from 
downstream customer use of sold gas.

To achieve our environmental goals for our natural 
gas business, we’re reducing methane leaks on our 
LDC systems, working with upstream suppliers on 
their efforts to reduce and eliminate emissions and 
working to increase the amount of fuels associated 
with lower emissions available to our natural gas 
utility customers.

17  Climate Report 2022, p. 65.

We are improving how we identify and remediate 
methane leaks as well as instituting operational 
practices to reduce valve maintenance and flaring 
during certain operational activities. We also work 
with other industry stakeholders to reduce and 
eliminate methane and carbon emissions through 
direct measurement and best practices. Key 
efforts include:

	 Scaling our satellite methane emissions data 

capture platform beyond the pilot phase, including 
expansion of satellite methane data captures to all 
of North Carolina in 2023.

	 Undertaking an academic study to determine 

the probability of detecting a leak with advanced 
satellite- and vehicle-based methane leak detection.

	 Deploying cross-compression technology to avoid 
releases or flaring during certain maintenance and 
operational activities.

	 Piloting the deployment of Gas Cloud Imaging 

technology at various facilities such as, an LNG 
facility and a compressor station to detect and 
measure methane leaks in real time.

	 Voluntarily increasing the frequency of our methane 

leak detection surveys, which has reduced the 
backlog of leaks by more than 85% from 2021 
through 2022.

Reducing Upstream and Downstream Emissions

	 Sourcing RNG for use at compressed natural gas (CNG) 

We are working to minimize upstream emissions related to the 
gas we purchase for our customers and the downstream CO2 
emissions related to our customers’ consumption of gas we sell. 
We are also investing in RNG as an important tool to tackle 
GHG emissions. RNG is considered carbon-neutral because it 
displaces geological gas and reduces the release of methane to 
the atmosphere. Key efforts include:

	 Ongoing work with upstream suppliers and industry groups 
such as ONE Future and the Gas Technology Institute’s 
Veritas protocol to reduce upstream methane emissions 
and establish standards and protocols to quantify and 
report emissions.

	 Sponsoring the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative, which 
is focused on the future development and deployment of 
hydrogen technologies at scale.

	 Creating GreenEdgeSM, a voluntary offset program, for 

residential and small commercial customers, which allows 
them to purchase carbon offsets and RNG environmental 
attributes to offset emissions from their use of natural gas.18

	 Expanding energy efficiency programs for commercial and 

residential customers to reduce energy usage.19

	 Incorporating RNG as a substitute for geologic natural gas for 
utility customers, which includes seeking regulatory approval.

stations. CNG dispensing of RNG provides transportation 
customers with a gasoline or diesel alternative, resulting in a 
reduced carbon footprint.

	 In addition to efforts to reduce emissions for our natural 

gas utility business, we actively participate in commercial 
opportunities to further promote renewable natural gas 
production and associated emission reductions. We intend 
to invest an additional $300 million in the next five years, 
including the following:

	• Investing in SustainRNG, which focuses on agricultural 

sector projects that include converting methane emissions 
into a renewable and usable fuel sources.

	• Launching Foothills Renewables and Upper Piedmont 

Renewables to convert landfill gas from two North Carolina 
landfills into renewable natural gas. Each project is 
projected to produce roughly 500,000 dekatherms (Dth) of 
renewable natural gas each year. The combined 1 million 
Dth is equivalent to the average annual natural gas usage 
of nearly 17,000 residential customers in North Carolina.

Carbon Capture 

Duke Energy Indiana and several industry partners have 
applied for DOE funds for a front-end engineering design study 
to evaluate an integrated carbon capture and sequestration 
project at Duke Energy’s Edwardsport Indiana 595-MW Coal 

Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle facility. This project’s 
demonstration of post-combustion carbon capture – with on-
site/local sequestration – could be an important step in the 
road map to a lower carbon future.

Electrifying Transportation

Increased customer demand for electric vehicles (EVs) will grow 
our electric business. Our new EV strategy showcases how 
Duke Energy participates in this space. Our strategy supports 
and enables innovation and infrastructure to support the 
electrification of our state’s vehicle fleets.

Our strategy to electrify transportation includes investing $100 
million by 2025 to help decarbonize transportation, manage 
EV charging loads, pilot EV infrastructure projects and electrify 
our fleet.20 For instance, we are converting 100% of our 
light-duty vehicles and 50% of our combined fleet of medium-
duty, heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids 
(PHEVs) or other zero-carbon alternatives by 2030. To date, 
over 750 vehicles, or 11% of our fleet, are electrified. We are 
also helping our customers electrify their fleets and supporting 
our jurisdictions as they implement National Electric Vehicle 
Infrastructure programs.

Duke Energy is committed to delivering and supporting its 
robust set of customer-facing EV programs and operationalizing 
internal resources to support business objectives.

We are working on an expanded suite of EV programs, making it more affordable and 
convenient for customers to access charging infrastructure across the areas we serve:

Indiana: We launched EV programs that will run through 2024, including the Off-
Peak Credit program, which gives 500 residential customers a quarterly bill credit 
for charging EVs during times of decreased energy demand. The Charger Solution 
program offers an EV charger for a flat rate each month to residential and business 
customers. We are also implementing fast charging infrastructure as part of a 
state-led award of Volkswagen mitigation funds, and we have been approved for EV 
charger incentives for commercial and school bus customers as well as to support 
fleet electrification.

Florida: We are piloting a project to test 
whether customers can use EVs to power 
their homes during outages. This research 
and development will evaluate the viability 
of high-capacity batteries as a grid edge 
resource that could help transform the 
energy system.21 Residential off-peak 
credits reward residents for avoiding times 
of grid congestion when charging EVs. 
We also offer rebates for nonresidential 
EV charging installations, thus far 
providing notable support for school 
bus electrification.

North Carolina: We worked on new 
technology with the University of North 
Carolina at Charlotte, the city of Charlotte 
and the Centralina Regional Council to use 
existing streetlight infrastructure to create 
EV charging stations. We found that using 
streetlight infrastructure cut the costs 
associated with installing charging stations 
by as much as 50%.22 We also launched 
the Charger Prep Credit program that 
provides credits to reduce the upfront cost 
of upgrading electrical systems to install 
charging infrastructure for homeowners 
and businesses. With several hundred 
participants already engaged in North 
Carolina, we have filed to expand the 
program to South Carolina and Kentucky.

Innovative EV Programs

Duke Energy is partnering with Ford Motor 
Company, General Motors and BMW of North 
America to pilot a flat monthly fee for North 
Carolina EV owners to charge their vehicles 
at home, and in exchange, the owners agree 
to not charge their vehicles during daily 
peak periods or grid constrained events. The 
pilot received NCUC approval in June 2022 
and should begin enrolling customers in 
spring 2023.

In August 2022, Duke Energy partnered 
with Ford Motor Company to develop a 
pilot in North Carolina that will compensate 
participants authorizing the utility to discharge 
their EV battery to the grid during constrained 
periods. The proposal, which is pending 
before the NCUC, will target customers in 
our Duke Energy Carolinas (North Carolina) 
service area. Eligible customers must be a 
Ford vehicle lessee, and the compensation 
will be an upfront incentive paid directly 
to Ford that will reduce the monthly lease 
payment. In addition to the regulated pilot 
in North Carolina, a small-scale research 
and development test will be conducted 
concurrently in Florida utilizing company-
owned vehicles. The primary objective of both 
efforts is to learn more about vehicle-to-grid 
technology and capabilities to help inform 
future EV programs.

	 Advocating for enabling policies that support 

investments in clean energy infrastructure, including 
most recently the IRA, the IIJA and North Carolina 
House Bill 951. 

	 Analyzing climate-related risks and opportunities 

and fortifying our operations toward

Climate Risk Management

Climate change poses an inherent risk to our business 
and demands that we identify, evaluate and deploy 
mitigation tools as part of our enterprisewide risk 
management philosophy.

We are peering into the next decade and beyond to 
identify, assess and manage climate-related risks, 
including potential risks to physical infrastructure, our 
transition to clean energy sources, the development 
of the new technologies needed for that transition, 
and the risks and impacts of federal and state 
energy policies.

To manage these risks effectively, we include climate 
change considerations in our annual enterprise risk 
assessment (ERA) process. The ERA identifies 
potential major and substantive risks to corporate 
profitability and value. It is managed by the enterprise 
risk management (ERM) team, which supports 
embedded business unit resources to identify, 
characterize, track and monitor risks in business unit 
risk registers. To learn more about our ERM team, see 
our Enterprise Risk Management section.

We are, for example, taking a closer look at climate-
related physical risks and the potential vulnerability 
of the company’s assets to future climate change 
impacts. In 2021, we initiated a Climate Risk and 
Resilience Study of the Carolinas transmission and 
distribution (T&D) system.25 This study had two 
primary objectives: (1) to assess the vulnerability of 

25  Physical Risk section of Climate Report pp. 24-25.

our T&D assets and operations to projected physical 
impacts of climate change and (2) to develop a flexible 
framework to improve the Carolinas T&D system’s 
resilience. More details on this effort can be found in 
our 2022 Climate Report.

The Board of Directors’ Finance and Risk Management 
Committee meets bimonthly to receive updates on 
potential risks, with a focus on our clean energy 
transition as a way to mitigate transition-related 
climate risk. The Board also routinely discusses 
climate risk governance. For more detail about  
Duke Energy’s Board of Directors’ ESG oversight, 
please refer to the Board Governance section.

Environmental Impact

We have an obligation to protect and manage natural 
resources where we operate and to reduce our 
environmental impact, wherever possible.

Water

We use water in many ways – from generating 
electricity through hydroelectric power, pumped 
storage, to providing cooling for power plants. We 
are committed to helping protect both the water 
quality and water supply in river basins where we 
operate. This is important for the environment, our 
communities, which depend upon this resource, as 
well as our business continuity.

Hydroelectric Facilities and Water Supply

Duke Energy works with a number of local advisory 
groups to monitor water levels and water chemistry in 
geographies where we have operations. For example, 
several of Duke Energy’s power plants in the Carolinas 
are located on hydroelectric reservoirs operated by the 
company. In these areas, we collaborate with local 
water utilities, environmental groups, homeowners 
and recreational enthusiasts on shoreline watershed 
and drought planning.

For our hydroelectric projects, there are drought 
response plans, known as low inflow protocols (LIPs), 
embedded in the projects’ Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) operating permits. When certain 
conditions are reached and drought stage is declared, 
watershed users and stakeholders take certain 
agreed-upon actions; this most recently occurred in 
2017. Unless there is an emergency, we endeavor to 
maintain lake levels within the ranges set forth in each 
FERC permit.

Other Duke Energy facilities are less susceptible 
to drought considerations because the facilities 
have closed-cycle cooling and/or operate on large 
sources of water or cooling reservoirs. For example, 
our Brunswick Nuclear Plant draws water from an 
estuarine environment, protecting it from drought-
related risks.

Reducing Annual Water Withdrawals 

Our aim is to reduce annual water withdrawals by our 
generation fleet by 1 trillion gallons by 2030, dropping 
from the 2016 level of 5.34 trillion gallons. In 2022, 
withdrawals were approximately 5.06 trillion gallons, a 
reduction of 0.28 trillion gallons.

As we continue to transition to cleaner energy, we will 
reduce water withdrawals. We anticipate further water 
savings as our coal and older natural gas plants are 
retired and replaced with newer, eventually hydrogen-
capable, natural gas combined-cycle plants utilizing 
more efficient closed-cycle cooling systems. We are 
also considering water use when evaluating new 
technologies, such as green hydrogen.

Biodiversity

Our Corporate Commitment to Biodiversity – published 
in 2021 – describes how we use best management 
practices and procedures, and the mitigation hierarchy 
process (avoid, minimize, restore/rehabilitate), 
as an integral part of our project planning, siting, 
construction, operational and maintenance decisions.

In 2022, Duke Energy was recognized by the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) for our 
participation in the Candidate Conservation Agreement 
with Assurances (CCAA) for the monarch butterfly. 
CCAAs are voluntary conservation agreements 
between the USFWS and one or more public or 
private parties. The USFWS works with its partners 
to identify threats to candidate species, plan the 
measures needed to address the threats and conserve 
these species, develop agreements, and design and 
implement conservation measures (e.g., on power line 
rights of way) and identify their effectiveness through 
annual monitoring. The Monarch CCAA is a model for 
demonstrating non-traditional partnerships that meet 
Duke Energy’s business objectives while also achieving 
beneficial and collaborative conservation measures.

Also in 2022, Duke Energy was presented with 
several awards from the CCAA for the Monarch 
Butterfly for actions taken by the company within 
the program.

Waste

Duke Energy aims to maintain a solid waste recycling 
rate of 80%.26 To achieve this goal, we formed teams 
to identify an enterprisewide strategy to minimize 
waste streams across air, water and land. The teams 
are implementing initiatives to avoid waste generation, 
promote reuse and repurposing of generated materials 
and identify reuse and recycling technologies 
and partners.

Duke Energy also leverages insight from trade groups 
on best practices for recycling and disposal of solar 
panels that have reached the end of their service life.

Beyond our immediate operations, Duke Energy 
is also looking to manage supplier waste. Through 
our procurement selection process, we have a 
scorecard that considers sustainability impacts like 
generated waste.

Environmental Compliance

Our environmental compliance work is guided by 
Duke Energy’s Environmental, Health and Safety 
(EHS) Management policies, which articulates 
our commitment to protect our communities and 
responsibly manage natural resources.

As we review potential projects, we evaluate the 
site, the technology, and the design to maximize 
the benefits to our communities while minimizing 
environmental impacts.

Site selection includes review of historical land use; 
assessment of current environmental site conditions, 
surveys to identify endangered and protected 
species and their critical habitat studies to identify 
surface water features such as wetlands, streams, 
and flood plains; and evaluation of cultural and 
archaeological resources.

Once preliminary site due diligence is completed, 
project teams work to design and execute projects 
in ways that reduce environmental impacts and 
incorporate community needs.

Duke Energy follows and complies with the federal, 
state and local regulatory requirements across 
the jurisdictions where we operate. This includes 
communicating public notices and working with 
the correct regulatory groups for emergencies 
and interruptions in service. Through the project 
construction and the life of the infrastructure 
operation, routine maintenance and inspections are 
employed to maintain compliance and to minimize 
environmental impacts.

Duke Energy continues to meet applicable federal and 
state requirements for its coal ash basins and landfills, 
including the EPA’s Coal Combustion Residuals 
Rule, the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act, 
as well as other state and local agreements and 
orders. Information about Duke Energy’s Coal Ash 
Management is available on our website.

26  This commitment excludes Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions, which has a relatively small waste stream.

2022 Electricity Generated and Generation Capacity

Duke Energy has a diverse, increasingly clean generation portfolio.  
Over 40% of the electricity we generated in 2022 was from carbon-free 
sources, including nuclear, wind, hydro and solar. Forty-two percent was from 
lower-carbon natural gas, which emits about half as much carbon dioxide as 
coal when combusted. Approximately 17% was from higher-carbon coal and 
oil. Taken together, owned and purchased renewables are equivalent to almost 
11% of our electricity generation.

Emissions From Electric Generation

Many factors influence emissions levels and intensities, including demand for 
electricity, generation diversity and efficiency, weather, fuel and purchased 
power prices, and emissions controls deployed. Since 2005, our carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased by 44%, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions 
decreased by 98% and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions decreased by over 
82%. These decreases are primarily due to the addition of pollution control 
equipment for SO2 and NOx in previous years, replacement of coal generation 
with natural gas and renewables and increased dispatch of cleaner, more 
efficient plants. In 2021 and 2022, CO2 emissions were somewhat higher 
than in 2020 due to increased generation as the economy began to rebound 
from the pandemic.

Methane (CH4) is the primary component of natural gas and is a greenhouse 
gas. Duke Energy announced in October 2020 its goal of reducing methane 
emissions in its natural gas distribution companies to net-zero by 2030. 
The emissions reported here are estimates pursuant to EPA's Subpart W 
reporting and the Natural Gas Sustainability Initiative (NGSI). Subpart W has 
a prescribed methodology for capturing emissions from facility counts such as 
miles of pipe, customer meters, and numbers of services using standardized 
emissions factors and the NGSI accounts for other data points that are not

gas in high-voltage electric transmission and distribution switchgear. We work 
to minimize SF6 emissions, but some are released during operations and 
maintenance. We continue to work with leading industry research institutes 
on improved SF6 leak detection technology. Duke Energy monitors equipment 
health, leveraging business intelligence reporting to support system reliability 
programs. The significant reduction of SF6 emissions in 2022 represents 
improved line of sight on data completeness and inventory validation, in 
conjunction with proactive equipment repair. We have identified and scheduled 
several projects for completion in 2023 to help mitigate SF6 emissions 
from equipment.

Customer Affordability and Accessibility

Duke Energy prioritizes affordability and is working to provide 
customers with additional options and ways to control their 
energy use. Our tailored solutions team aids customers in need 
and low-income customers by adopting and implementing 
new technology in the hopes of reducing energy burden on 
customers, which is especially important in the face of inflation 
and rising costs.

In 2022, more than $192 million helped nearly 189,000  
Duke Energy electric customers across our service territories 
through funds generated by employee and customer donations, 

state and federal programs, local agencies, Duke Energy 
Foundation grants and other sources.

We have helped connect customers to nearly $300 million in 
energy assistance over the past two years and have created a 
team dedicated to working with more than 1,400 community 
assistance agencies to improve the experience dispersing these 
important funds. A new online portal allows assistance agencies 
and local partners faster access to the information they need 
when a customer requests help. 

Our 2022 customer affordability and accessibility 
programs included:

	 Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP): 

Customers in all jurisdictions we serve are eligible for 
LIHEAP support if their earnings are below a certain 
income threshold.

Reliability

We also continue to prioritize resiliency to preserve reliable service for our customers and communities in the face 
of evolving weather and emerging threats. For example, we are installing smart, self-healing technology that can 
automatically detect power outages, isolate the problem and then quickly reroute service to other available lines to 
restore power faster. When layered with improved system control technologies, this helps us increase the resiliency 
of the power supply, as well as be alerted to and mitigate cyber risks. In 2022, smart, self-healing technology

Maintaining and improving the reliability of our 
systems has been and will continue to be our 
highest priority. In December, Winter Storm Elliott, 
an extremely powerful weather event with a unique 
confluence of high winds, extreme temperature 
drops and other conditions forced Duke Energy to 
temporarily interrupt power to approximately 500,000 
customers as a last resort on Christmas Eve. We 
regret not being able to provide customers with more 
notice of the outages. We own what happened. 
We have set out on a path to ensure that if we are 
faced with similar challenges, we will see a different 
outcome and provide a better customer experience.

Energy Efficiency & Customer Experience

Duke Energy offers several energy efficiency programs 
to empower customers to reduce their energy costs 
and help us manage electricity load. By the end of 
2025, our energy efficiency programs will have saved 
a total of 24 million MWh of energy consumption and 
8 million tons of carbon emissions, which is equivalent 
to the emissions produced by more than 2 million 
homes. In fact, our programs have resulted in twice 
as much energy savings for our customers as other 
energy companies in the Southeast.

Our 2022 initiatives included:

	 Rooftop Solar: We obtained significant feedback 

from stakeholders on ways to maximize the value of 

	 Clean Energy Connection: A program that lets 
residential and business customers in Florida 
support renewable energy, subscribe to solar power 
and earn credits toward their electricity bills – all 
without equipment installation or maintenance.

	 Home Energy Reports: We provided individual 
reports on home energy use for over 2.6 million 
residential customers each month.

	 Residential Carbon Tool: We developed and now 

offer a monthly report that allows customers to see 
their unique carbon footprint and ways to reduce it.

	 Program and Engagement Options: To simplify 

next steps for customers who want to take action 
to save energy and money, the company’s Online 
Marketplace, retailer discounts and in-home 
assessments continue to be cost-effective choices 
for customers.

We look forward to incorporating state clean energy 
goals into our existing offerings, developing new 
solutions, and continuing to work closely with our 
stakeholders to help our customers save energy. 

Program Improvements

We are dedicated to providing an excellent customer 
experience. Beginning in 2022, Duke Energy launched 
governance meetings with shareholders on our 
customer experience strategy.

Duke Energy remains committed to the many diverse 
communities we serve. Our long-term success and 
sustainability are dependent on the quality of service we can 
provide to our shared communities. Families, employees, 
students, local businesses and so many others rely on  
Duke Energy to support many aspects of daily life. From 
heating the home to boiling water, Duke Energy is there to 
provide continuous and reliable service. To best serve the 
needs of our company and our community, we remain flexible 
and amenable to augmenting our strategy as needed. Here at 
Duke Energy, we believe that continued learning and agility 

allow us to best serve changing needs and expectations. We 
rely on community input to determine how we can continue 
to improve. As part of the community ourselves, we recognize 
the importance of building and maintaining meaningful 
relationships with community leaders, historically marginalized 
groups, and all others that depend on our efficacy. The  
Duke Energy Foundation helps to support vibrant economies, 
climate resilience, and justice, equity and inclusion in our local 
communities. By supporting a multitude of various projects,  
Duke Energy can continue to give back to the communities 
that give to us. The health and well-being of the communities 
we serve motivates our goals to be a constructive pillar of the 
community. With continual improvements and collaboration, 
Duke Energy can strive for excellence in all that we do and 
keep our communities strong.

Economic Development

Duke Energy’s 35-person economic development team works 
with regional, state, and local authorities to attract growing 
companies to the communities we serve. In 2022 alone, the 
team has secured 89 projects, resulting in 29,100 new jobs 
and over $23 billion in capital investments to Duke Energy’s 
six service territories, including companies in battery, EV and 
semiconductor industries. With an important role in providing 
the energy infrastructure, our team evaluates properties for 
potential business and industrial development through  
Duke Energy’s Site Readiness program. Since 2005, the Site 
Readiness Program has evaluated 345 sites with 106 “project 
wins,” generating $27.9 billion in capital investment and almost 
36,000 jobs. Site Selection magazine named Duke Energy to 
its “Top Utilities in Economic Development” list for the 18th 
consecutive year.27

Environmental Justice and the Just Transition

	 Integrating assessment protocols into stakeholder 

The energy sector must transition for the future in a manner 
that addresses environmental justice and just transition for our 
customers, workforce and communities. Duke Energy strives 
to strengthen and build infrastructure that will deliver reliable 
and affordable energy. As we consider potential projects, we 
evaluate the site, the technology, and the design to maximize 
benefits, including economic, to our communities while 
reducing environmental impacts.

Environmental Justice 

Duke Energy worked with industry groups to help develop our 
environmental justice principles and best practices. Integrating 
environmental justice principles into our due diligence process 
for siting helps us make informed decisions for both our 
business and communities. We do this through a systematic 
assessment process and dialogue with community leaders. 
To ensure our environmental justice process includes diverse 
perspectives and is sufficiently supported, we created the 
Environmental Justice Working Group comprised of members 
of Environmental Health & Safety, Government and Community 
Relations, Legal and business unit project support teams to 
carry out key initiatives across the company. Our work in this 
area in 2022 included:

	 Developing an environmental justice assessment process for 
evaluating future new generation and greenfield projects that 
utilizes technical resources from EPA, community knowledge 
from our community relationship management teams and 
community input gathered through engagement, such as 
listening sessions.

	 Training more than 200 employees across environmental, 

engagement strategies and project development procedures.

	 Incorporating environmental justice into Duke Energy’s 

request for proposal selection process.

In 2022, we conducted initial environmental justice 
assessments on more than 55 sites. The findings from each 
assessment help us to identify potential environmental justice 
communities earlier in the project planning cycle and provide 
opportunities for enhanced engagement.

We have engaged in numerous roundtable discussions with 
industry leaders such as Electric Power Research Institute 
(EPRI), EEI, and Nuclear Energy Institute, and various utility 
groups to collaborate and discuss how to anticipate and 
respond to environmental justice concerns.

Read more in our Environmental Justice Priority Brief.

Just Transition

As the energy sector transitions, we are working to ensure 
our workforce and others in our industry are set up for long-
term success. As part of this commitment, we worked with 
stakeholders to create a series of guiding principles that informs 
our approach to a just transition.

In 2022, we engaged a third party to perform an assessment 
of our upcoming and near-term coal retirements, noting 
community demographics, plant specifics and adjacent 
employment opportunities. Duke Energy has retired 56 coal 
units since 2010 and is using information gleaned from those 
energy communities to inform our strategic thinking, and we 
continue to gather lessons learned, most recently at Gallagher 
Station in Indiana and in Asheville.

external engagement and project development teams on the 
assessment process.

Our approach to the just transition relies on constant 
communication with our current employees. Understanding 

employee needs through transparent and frequent conversations 
has steered Duke Energy toward equitable solutions to 
unavoidable shifts in the workforce, particularly as we phase 
out coal plants. Learn more about our skills-based workforce 
development approach in the Training and Development 
section of this report. In general, we have been able to find an 
opportunity for most Duke Energy employees that would like 
to stay with the company, and our skills-based development 
programs have contributed to this success.

We need to train the next generation of the workforce – for our 
sector – in new skills while ensuring we also have a diverse 
pipeline of talent for the jobs of today. As a component of this 
work, the Duke Energy Foundation also awarded over $2.8 
million in support of workforce development programs with a 
focus on the energy sector in 2022. The funds include more 
than $1.4 million in grants to 22 community college programs 
across its service areas working to create a pipeline of skilled 
lineworkers who will help meet the energy industry’s future 
workforce needs.

Transition Priority Brief.

Charitable Giving

The Duke Energy Foundation invests over $30 million annually 
in charitable giving. In 2022, we refreshed the Foundation’s 
vision, which prioritizes three pillars: vibrant economies; climate 
resilience; and justice, equity and inclusion. Through this 
approach, our philanthropy is well aligned with our net-zero 
business strategy and helps to amplify the benefits of the clean 
energy transition in our communities. In all our efforts, we aim 
to use our unique capabilities to address important community 
needs. In 2022, Duke Energy contributed over $17 million to 
partner organizations aligned with the Foundation’s vision.

announced the North Carolina nonprofits that received a total 
of $1 million in grants provided by the Duke Energy Foundation 
to advance social justice and racial equity. The program 
distributed $25,000 to 40 organizations across the state. Since 
2020, we’ve also provided more than $15.8 million to support 
building a diverse energy workforce. Learn more about the 
Foundation’s work here.

Duke Energy employees put our Foundation’s strategy into 
practice and carry out key volunteerism and community 
engagement initiatives. In 2022, Duke Energy employees 
and retirees dedicated over 100,000 hours to local projects, 
contributing almost $3 million in estimated value of their 
volunteer time. The multiweek, annual Power of Giving 
campaign empowers employees and retirees to support their 
communities and causes of their choice through volunteering 
and donations that are matched dollar for dollar, up to $2,500 
annually, by the Duke Energy Foundation. The program 
provided more than $13 million for communities in 2022.

The Duke Energy Foundation’s President guides our 
Foundation work and communicates regularly with executives 
and Foundation trustees to operationalize the Foundation’s 
charitable focus. The president is supported directly by the 
Foundation’s operations and engagement team and works 
closely with our state leads. As the Foundation demonstrates 
meaningful business alignment, we will continue developing 
and strengthening community relationships.

Employees

Employee Health & Safety

Safety is a Duke Energy core value and foundational to 
everything we do. Our enterprise dedication to safety helps 
us attract, retain, and protect the best people. Our goal is to 
achieve a zero-injury workplace, and we continue to review 
our safety practices and training to keep our employees and 
contractors safe.

For the eighth straight year, we expect to maintain our industry-
leading safety performance as measured by Total Incident 
Case Rate (TICR). In 2022, the company’s TICR increased 
slightly from 0.36 to 0.40. We recorded 16 total work-related 
employee serious injuries.

Oversight of our Employee Health & Safety programs sits at the 
highest levels of the company, and the Board-led Operations 
and Nuclear Oversight Committee is briefed quarterly on 
performance. The Director, Corporate Health & Safety and the 
Director, Corporate Environmental Governance are responsible 
for daily EHS oversight, with support from a dedicated team 
of environmental and safety specialists. They report to the 
Vice President of Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS), 
with ultimate oversight from the Senior Vice President, Coal 
Combustion Products & EHS.

Duke Energy maintains several hazard recognition and  
reporting programs, such as the EHS Observation Program,  
the Pre-job Safety Briefing Standard, the Job Hazard 
Assessment process and the High-risk Tools Program. All 
employees receive regular training through our EHS Training 
Program. The curriculum is tailored to employees’ individual 
program and job responsibilities, while factoring in relevant 
regulations and compliance. Completion is tracked through  
our MyLearning Learning Management System.

In 2022, Duke Energy continued strengthening its 
high-energy hazard detection and mitigation program, 
which helps employees prioritize their actions to 
reduce events that have the greatest potential to 
result in a serious injury or fatality. We participated 
in Edison Electric Institute's (EEI) the Future of Safety 
Metrics Working Group, which developed a new 
safety measure – the Severity-Based Lagging Indicator 
– which will be piloted in 2023 as part of the EEI 
survey. Furthermore, the Future of Safety Metrics 
Working Group is developing the framework for the 
Hazardous Energy Controls Assessment (HECA), a 
method for performing field observations that focuses 
on identifying and mitigating high-energy hazards and 
the presence/absence of direct controls before the 
work occurs. Duke Energy plans to pilot the HECA 
in 2023.

Attracting the Best Talent

Training and Development 

We continuously evaluate our practices across the hiring 
life cycle to deliver on our commitments to customers. This 
includes building relationships with four-year colleges and 
technical schools, as well as community organizations and 
professional organizations to strengthen our pipeline of high-
quality, skilled and diverse talent to build the infrastructure for 
our net-zero carbon future. In 2022, we invested more than 
$1.4 million to support workforce development programs to 
create a pipeline of skilled lineworkers via grants to help meet 
the energy industry’s future clean energy educational and 
workforce training needs. These grants were awarded to 22 
community colleges across our electric utility service area, 
including establishing a new lineworker program in Charlotte, 
North Carolina. 

We are committed to providing market-competitive, fair and 
equitable compensation by regularly reviewing employee pay 
and conducting internal pay equity reviews, benchmarking 
against peer companies to ensure our pay is competitive.

We support the well-being of our employees and their families 
physically, emotionally, and financially through our wellness and 
mental health programs. In 2022, we launched a new digital 
diabetes support program to help prevent or manage diabetes 
by creating lasting lifestyle changes. We continue to promote 
financial well-being through education campaigns and the 
opportunity for employees to connect with a financial coach.

As the energy industry goes through a massive transition,  
we are focused on helping employees gain the skills they  
need to succeed. Some of our key skills-based development 
programs include: 

	 Multiskilling: We are providing additional training to coal 
plant workers to maintain our track record of successfully 
placing employees impacted by plant retirements in other 
positions within the company.

	 Talent Marketplace: Through this program, employees stay in 
their current role while spending time each week working with 
other departments to develop skills, build new relationships, 
and expand their knowledge of the company. These short-
term development opportunities, known as “gigs,” present 
pathways for employees to move into new roles and areas of 
the business giving them more career opportunities and the 
company a more agile workforce.

	 Power Your Career Framework: In 2022, Duke Energy 
rolled out the Power Your Career framework, which 
helps employees take charge of their career development 
by providing resources and workshops on career and 
development opportunities. These sessions have generated 
significant interest and positive feedback from employees.

Employee Voice

“The Voice” survey is our primary tool to measure employee 
engagement and solicit feedback. The survey uses the employee 
Net Promoter Score (eNPS), based on a -100 to +100 scale, to 
gauge the likelihood of employees recommending Duke Energy 
as a place to work to a friend or colleague. In 2022, we had an 
ongoing survey response rate of 41%, and our overall eNPS was 
30 (consistent with 2021 results).

Topics such as ethics and safety, teamwork and employee 
sentiment toward their immediate supervisor/manager 
consistently score very favorably. For example, over 90% of 
employees report they understand the resources available 
to report concerns, feel supported in raising concerns and 
believe leadership will address concerns in a timely manner. 
In addition to enterprisewide programs and initiatives, we 
leverage engagement councils to implement targeted actions 
within business units. A few examples of changes based on 
survey feedback include a leadership spotlight series to provide 
insight and build relationships amongst senior leadership and 
employees, business unit recognition programs and additional 
mentorship programs and career development workshops. 
Ongoing measurement is important and promotes frequent 
conversations at all levels about what we are getting right and 
what we can do better.

Governance

Duke Energy’s Human Resources organization is responsible 
for our human capital management strategy, which includes 
recruiting and hiring, employee engagement, diversity and 
inclusion, workforce planning, talent and succession planning, 
performance management and employee development. Human 
capital management is supported by strategic oversight from 
our Board of Directors, primarily through the Compensation and 
People Development Committee.

Diversity and Inclusion

A diverse workforce and an inclusive culture make our company 
stronger. Our senior leadership team is fully aligned and is 
accountable for the company’s progress.

We are working to increase diversity across our workforce. To support our 
goals of increasing diverse representation, Duke Energy has developed 
partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as 
well as other organizations like the National Urban League and the American 
Association of Blacks in Energy. Our workforce in 2022 consisted of 
approximately 23.9% women and 20.4% people of color. We’re proud to have 
reached our aspirational workforce goal of 20% people of color in 2022 and 
will continue to strive toward our aspirational goal for women in the workforce. 
We recently established new aspirational goals of 23% for people of color and 
28% for women, as reflected in our ESG Goals table.

We also collaborate with military organizations and community colleges 
to support training opportunities for diverse students as we work toward 
increasing our diverse pipeline of technical workers. We are dedicated to 
strengthening the pipeline of HBCU student and graduate talent through 
engagement, awareness, education and sustainable relationships. This  
strategy includes strong partnerships from leaders across the company.

survey was 83. Our highest scoring questions were “My manager treats me with respect” (94%) and “My manager 
supports inclusion and diversity in the workplace” (92%). We also increased participation in our Employee Resource 
Groups (ERGs) in 2022 and launched a new ERG to focus on mental wellness and foster increased awareness 
and support around neurodiversity. The company has 10 ERGs with 37 chapters and more than 6,500 employees 
participating or about 23% of our workforce.

Duke Energy continues to grow its “Let’s Talk About It” conversations. These are a series of discussions about thought-
provoking topics to help build awareness and understanding in support of an inclusive workplace. In 2022, more than 
8,000 employees participated in these conversations, an increase from 5,500 in 2021.

Suppliers

Our suppliers are key partners in Duke Energy’s clean 
energy transition, and our collaboration brings long-
term value and benefits to our customers, employees, 
shareholders, communities and the environment. 
We measure the effectiveness of our engagement 
initiatives by managing each unique relationship based 
on the level of supplier across critical, strategic and 
foundational categories. 

Our supply chain sustainability strategy is to work 
with suppliers to reduce emissions, deploy new 
technologies for the clean energy transition, promote 
economic development and increase diversity among 
our suppliers. Sustainability throughout our supply 
chain supports our net-zero by 2050 goals as we 
aim to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 50% from 
2021 levels by 2035. In addition, our enterprisewide 
aspirational goal is to increase Tier 1 spend to $2 
billion by the end of 2027. Achieving this will require 
us to increase both our total enterprise spend annually 
as well as our diverse supplier spend growth rate.

Sustainability Survey

We consider sustainable practices during the bid 
evaluation phase for suppliers. In 2022, we updated 
our sustainability survey, which evaluates suppliers 
based on environmental and social criteria and 
benchmarks them against industry peers. Through 
this survey, suppliers can submit an improvement 
plan in areas where they may be below their industry 
peer benchmarks.

Duke Energy also completed an estimate of our Scope 
3 GHG emissions related to products and services. 

This provided a baseline figure for our supply chain as 
we plan for emissions reductions in 2023. 

Strengthening Local Economies

Our supply chain spend is an important avenue 
to strengthen local economies, diversity and 
environmental stewardship in our sourcing selection 
process. We conduct outreach to raise awareness 
about supply chain opportunities for local, regional 
and national trade associations, educational 
institutions, community economic development 
organizations and others. In 2022, we promoted 
economic development and support for our 
communities, including:

	 Spending $14 billion overall on supplier goods and 
services to provide electricity and natural gas to 
our customers.

	 Spending more than $5 billion with local suppliers. 

	 Spending with diverse suppliers, in excess of $1.8 

billion, with nearly $700 million of the total coming 
from subcontracts with our prime contractors. 

We also support economic development through Hire 
North Carolina, which is directed and overseen by 
the NCUC. Duke Energy has added 166 suppliers 
to our Hire North Carolina list of qualified resident 
contractors, expanding the local contracting source 
pool for high-value work within the state. In 2022, 
Duke Energy awarded $154 million to resident 
contractors through 22 contracts, four of which were 
signed with diverse businesses.

Supply Chain Continuity 

Duke Energy’s supply chain strategy works to optimize 
its warehouse and logistics network, leverage data 
analytics and advanced technologies and strengthen 
relationships and coordination with suppliers. We 
address supply chain continuity issues by improving 
demand planning and forecasting, proactively placing 
material orders in advance, and prioritizing available 
inventory to maintain storm readiness and meet the 
greatest customer needs. 

Recognizing the likelihood of continued supply 
challenges, Duke Energy has a continued focus on:

	 Leveraging its scale to maintain affordability and 

reliability for customers

	 Making longer-term commitments with suppliers 

to secure critical clean energy materials like 
solar panels 

	 Refurbishing and recycling key grid improvement 

products, including wooden poles and transformers

	 Identifying alternative sources of supply and 

substitute products, which often include diverse and 
local suppliers 

Our supply chain philosophy balances constrained 
supply and record-breaking demand to support Duke 
Energy’s capital plan while building a stronger supply 
chain that is demand-driven, customer-centric, and 
swift to adapt to headwinds.

and standards. We ensure continuity in our supply 
chain through policies, sourcing standards, standard 
legal terms and conditions, and our Supplier Code 
of Conduct.

Our Chief Procurement Officer oversees supply chain 
management in collaboration with key business units, 
including Finance, Legal and Ethics and Compliance. 
Day-to-day oversight of Duke Energy’s responsible

Sourcing, who reports to the Chief Procurement 
Officer. Duke Energy also has Supply Chain Non-
Financial Risk and Compliance, Supply Chain Policy 
and Controls, and Vendor Risk Management functions 
that report up through the Chief Procurement Officer.

Supplier adherence to Duke Energy’s responsible 
terms and conditions and our Supplier Code of 
Conduct is a condition of doing business with the 
company. Our Duke Energy Sourcing Standards 
provide direction on bid events, evaluations and 
awarded contracts. Duke Energy’s supply chain 
adheres to the Supply Chain Operating Model, Supply 
Chain Sourcing Standards, Purchasing Controls Policy, 
Purchase Authority Policy and Accounts Payable 
Policy, that promote fair labor practices, ethical 
principles and financial and regulatory compliance. 
Our public policies include:

	 Supplier Code of Conduct 

	 Human Rights Policy 

Supply Chain Governance

Our supply chain governance process ensures our 
suppliers operate safely and in compliance with 
all regulations, laws, and relevant internal policies 

Suppliers are contractually required to report any 
policy violations by any party to Duke Energy. In 
addition, if we receive any reports of potential policy 
violations, we follow up with the supplier to address 
the potential policy violation.

Our Board Composition*

ESG Governance 

ESG is embedded across all areas of our business. Our ESG 
team oversees our day-to-day progress on key initiatives, 
goals, reporting and disclosures, and facilitates conversations 
with stakeholders.

The ESG Strategy & Disclosures Committee, established in 
2021, is responsible for ensuring awareness related to ESG 
activities across the company and meets on a bimonthly 
schedule. The committee is co-chaired by Legal, Accounting, 
and ESG/Sustainability and is represented by numerous Senior 
Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and directors across the 
business including representatives from Investor Relations, 
Enterprise Strategy, Diversity & Inclusion, Policy and 
other leaders.

Board Governance

Effective corporate governance continues to be a critical 
component of our business success. Our President and CEO 
Lynn Good chairs our Board of Directors, which provides 
leadership and guidance that drives sustainable, long-term 
value for our stakeholders, including employees, customers and 
the communities we serve. 

Our Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s long-
term strategy to provide clean, reliable and affordable energy 
to our customers. As part of this oversight, ESG topics, 
commitments and strategies are discussed at every meeting, 
with a focus on the company’s performance metrics and 
incentives that align with those commitments. Board members 
also discuss our climate strategy, with a focus on topics such 
as regulatory and legislative issues, jurisdictional matters, 
energy transition and more. We invite outside experts to offer 
the Board insights and implications related to global energy 

The Board regularly reviews its composition to ensure that its 
collective membership has the skills necessary to meet the 
needs of the business and reflects a diversity of perspectives 
and experiences. The Board is structured with a strong 
independent lead director role that assists the chair and CEO 
in setting agendas, approving meeting schedules and leading 
the independent members of the Board in executive committee 
sessions at each meeting, among other responsibilities. When 
there is a seat to fill, the Corporate Governance Committee 
identifies the skills and other qualifications needed. A third-
party executive search firm helps identify potential director 
candidates with these criteria in mind. 

All members of the Board, except Lynn Good, are independent 
and participate in one of Duke Energy’s five committees. The 
committees oversee all operational, financial, strategic and 
reputational risks, as set forth in their respective charters. In 
2022, the committees had the following responsibilities and 
ESG involvement:

Audit Committee

	 Quality and integrity of the corporation’s financial statements. 

	 Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

	 Independent auditors’ qualifications and independence.

	 Performance of the internal audit function and 

independent auditors.

	 Implementation and effectiveness of the ethics and 

compliance program.

	 Oversight for matters related to the security of, and risks 

related to, information technology systems and procedures 
and all ESG matters included in the periodic reports filed 
with the SEC.

Ethics and Compliance

The Duke Energy Ethics and Compliance Program 
sets expectations for the workforce with policies, 
communications and training across topics including 
fraud, anti-corruption, data and information 
management. The program also ensures accountability 
to those expectations with investigations, monitoring 
and other assurance activities. The program seeks 
to earn trust from key stakeholders adhering to 
political activity and compliance, anti-corruption 
compliance and state and federal regulatory 
compliance. In 2022, we continued to strengthen our 
ethics culture and compliance across the enterprise 
with enhanced technology, targeted messaging and 
process improvements.

Ethics and Compliance Governance

Our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) 
ensures the Ethics and Compliance Program is 
effective at preventing, detecting and responding 
to illegal or unethical conduct. Our CECO routinely 
reports updates on these matters to our Executive 
Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. 

Our CECO is a member of the ESG Strategy and 
Disclosure Committee, with specific responsibility 
for integrating ethics and compliance into our 
strategy and all ESG-related disclosures. The CECO 
also provides quarterly updates to the Ethics and 
Compliance Executive Committee and the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors. The Ethics and 
Compliance Executive Committee reviews the scope, 
implementation and effectiveness of the program 

and reports findings to the CEO, and the Board’s 
Audit Committee.

We continuously review policies and strengthen 
controls and oversight to improve performance and 
accountability. Our Ethics and Compliance work 
is governed by our core values of Safety, Integrity 
and Service, and three core codes: (1) the Code of 
Business Ethics for all employees; (2) the Supplier 
Code of Conduct for suppliers and contingent 
workers; and (3) the Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics for Members of the Board of Directors. These 
codes are supported by numerous policies related 
to Human Resources, Finance, EHS, Security and 
other compliance areas. Each group is expected to 
be familiar with and adhere to the applicable code to 
support good decisions aligned with our values. 

Employee Training

Employees are required to complete ethics training 
in their first 30 days on the job, as well as an annual 
ethics refresher and compliance training based on 
their role. Each year, all employees are also required 
to acknowledge their responsibility to comply with the 
Code of Business Ethics and confirm their obligation 
to report violations of laws, rules or company policies. 
Training is also provided for suppliers and members of 
the Board of Directors. 

Updated Policies

We expect company leadership to frequently discuss 
ethical issues with employees. Our efforts to support 
an ethical workplace include digitally transforming

the Ethics and Compliance reporting systems, 
strengthening political activity controls around 
lobbying and political expenditures and improving 
responses to data privacy breach prevention and 
exposures. In 2022, we implemented several policies 
and enhanced the control environment:

	 Implemented a new Retaliation-Free Workplace 

policy; previously this policy was embedded within 
other policies but is now a stand-alone policy. 

	 Created video training for the Board of Directors to 

reinforce ethical standards and principles.

	 Strengthened political activity controls around 

outside lobbyists and political expenditures including 
a new Political Advocacy and Coordination Firewall 
Policy and informational video for outside lobbyists. 

	 Developed a mass data exposure response protocol.

Learn more about Duke Energy’s political activity in 
the Political Giving section.

Grievance Mechanisms 

We continue to support a “speak up” culture where 
workers can ask questions and raise concerns without 
fear of retaliation. Duke Energy encourages workers to 
report suspected wrongdoing and offers anonymous, 
independent third-party reporting tools to address 
fear of reprisal. All allegations are investigated to 
ensure fair and consistent treatment, and retaliation is 
strictly prohibited. Our range of grievance mechanisms 
ensures communication channels and action, 
including: 

	 Open Door Policy: Lists the many grievance 

mechanisms available to employees and establishes 

our intent to provide an environment where 
employees feel free to raise concerns without fear of 
retaliation or intimidation.

	 Retaliation-Free Workplace Policy: Prohibits any 

negative employment action for reporting a concern 
or participating in an investigation. Anyone involved 
in retaliation will receive corrective action, up to and 
including termination of employment. 

	 EthicsLine: A dedicated telephone and online 

reporting service maintained by a third-party vendor 
that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week. Employees can choose to remain anonymous 
when using the EthicsLine. Anonymous reporters 
are provided with a unique identifying code to 
allow them to answer follow-up questions and to 
receive a response to their concerns. We triage and 
investigate 100% of reported cases. Each concern 
is documented in a central case management 
system upon receipt. 

	 Human Rights Grievance Mechanism:  

An assessment tool to ensure adherence to our 
Human Rights Policy Document.

	 Trending and Analysis: Ethics activity is gathered 
and evaluated on a regular basis to identify trends. 

In 2022, we received 1.9 reports per 100 employees 
of breaches of our ethics codes compared to our 
benchmark median of 1.7. Of those, 37% were 
substantiated, most resulting in corrective action. 
Corrective action includes, but is not limited 
to, discipline up to and including termination of 
employment, process and internal control reviews, 
policy improvements and communication to 
reinforce expectations.

Human Rights 

We conduct business in ways that are ethical and 
respectful of the dignity and rights of all people. Our 
Human Rights Policy formalizes our enterprisewide 
commitments to Duke Energy’s workforce, 
communities, stakeholders and suppliers, as well as 
transparency mechanisms. We are currently updating 
our policy to expand on our commitment to respecting 
and recognizing human rights, including personal and 
data privacy to be published in 2023. 

Human rights touch every area of our value chain – it 
is an enterprisewide effort to ensure all employees and 
suppliers are aware of our policies and procedures. 
The Legal, Ethics & Compliance, Supply Chain, 
and ESG teams are actively engaged in our human 
rights program. Supply Chain enforces and upholds 
our policies and practices daily while coordinating 
with suppliers and contingent workers, and Ethics 
& Compliance provides oversight and remedy 
mechanisms to protect and respect human rights. The 
ESG team keeps current on best practices and potential 
human rights risks in collaboration with Legal. Human 
rights activities also are discussed at least annually by 
the ESG Strategy and Disclosure Committee, and as 
needed with the Board of Directors.

In 2022, we increased our engagement by engaging 
a third party to perform a human rights assessment 
across the enterprise assessing our Human Rights 
Policy and human rights risks relative to appropriate 
business units. We also started expansion efforts to 
align our business with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals, as can be seen in the section 
divider pages of this report as well as in the Index at 
the back of this report. 

Other governing policies include the Code of Business 
Ethics and the Supplier Code of Conduct. 

Grid Security and Cybersecurity

As one of the nation’s largest grid operators and 
operators of designated critical natural gas pipelines, 
we know that ensuring the security of our assets and 
information is vital for delivering the essential service 
our customers and communities depend on. Steadfast 
and sophisticated cybersecurity and physical security 
operations are vital parts of that responsibility. 
Within the last three years, Duke Energy has only 
experienced immaterial information security events for 
which the total expenses incurred were immaterial.

International tensions in 2022 continue to underscore 
the need for a strong cybersecurity posture for our 
critical infrastructure, and the increased number  
of substation attacks across the nation and in  
Duke Energy’s own territory in Moore County put 
the spotlight on physical security measures and we 
continue to provide support and collaborate to help 
law enforcement in their ongoing investigation. When 
it comes to grid protection, we have a proactive 
strategy that includes robust standards, a multilayered 
physical defense system, a highly skilled, cross-
functional team of cybersecurity and physical security 
professionals that monitors and responds to threats 
24/7, and daily information sharing with our industry 
and government partners.

The cybersecurity team collects millions of data points 
every day and distills the threat data into actionable 
alerts. In 2022 alone, cybersecurity analysts 
conducted hands-on investigations of 35,000 alerts. 
The electric, nuclear power and natural gas sectors 
are also subject to a range of mandatory regulations

and security directives, as well as cybersecurity 
standards and voluntary guidelines. As we accelerate 
digital transformation across the company and further 
modernize our grid – including spending $75 billion 
over the next decade on grid improvements – we 
continue to implement advanced security measures 
for operational technology at our substations, power 
plants and new grid mechanisms.

We regularly communicate and coordinate with peer 
utilities, industry partners, security organizations and 
government agencies – including the Department of 
Homeland Security and the FBI – to share intelligence 
and best practices. To prepare to respond to threats, 
we hold drills several times a year to test incident 
response plans and ensure employees understand 
their roles in an event. We also participate in external 
drills that include members of management and, 
at times, our Board of Directors, which helps us 
coordinate with other critical infrastructure.

Last year, we also began sponsoring the Clean 
Energy Cybersecurity Accelerator (CECA) program 
at the Department of Energy’s National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory. Through this program, scientists 
are testing select emerging technologies at scale in a 
non-live environment and then providing us and other 
participating utilities with technical assessments of 
how the solutions performed. The first CECA cohort 
is focused on strong authentication technology for 
distributed energy resources – solutions that were 
built specifically for operational technology (OT) 
environments. This technology will be critical as  

Duke Energy continues to lead the nation’s largest 
clean energy transition and as our customers embrace 
their own net-zero journeys.

Duke Energy maintains a team dedicated to educating 
employees and building their awareness around 
threats – employing annual cyber responsibility 
trainings, sending routine phishing exercise emails 
and creating seminars and video resources that 
can be used at every level and by every division of 
the company.

The Audit Committee receives updates on our 
cybersecurity and physical security from the Chief 
Information Officer and other members of senior 
management, and reviews metrics and trends 
regularly throughout the year. The committee also 
discusses ESG disclosures and processes, as well 
as frameworks including physical, cyber, and data 
security disclosures.

The full Board is also regularly briefed on 
cybersecurity and physical security, and the reviews 
presented to the Audit Committee are followed 
by an update to the full Board by the chair of the 
Audit Committee.

Our work to keep our employees and facilities safe 
is never done. We continue to analyze the substation 
attacks in Moore County in December 2022 in an 
effort to improve our grid security. We continue to 
participate in the conversation around how to deter 
attacks on the grid – both physical and cyber – as we 
work to enhance our protections for our infrastructure.

Sustainable Financing Framework 

Our Sustainable Financing framework defines the investment areas aligned to 
our clean energy strategy, further enabling us to issue green and sustainability 
bonds, loans or other financing instruments. We have an over $145 billion 
capital plan over the next 10 years, approximately 85% of which represents 
investments toward our clean energy transition and grid modernization. 

Our long-term investment strategy will provide sustainable environmental, 
social and customer benefits as we work to achieve our net-zero goals. 

Eligible project categories include, but are not limited to, investments in 
renewable energy, energy efficiency, advanced grid technology, climate 
change adaptation and expanded opportunities for diverse suppliers and 
small businesses.

Since 2018, we have issued $5.5 billion in green and sustainability bonds. 
The Sustainable Financing framework strengthens our commitment to 
sustainable financing and broadens the scope of eligible projects to align with 
our ESG priorities. These bonds can help decrease long-term borrowing costs, 
which increase customer savings.

In August 2022, Duke Energy launched its inaugural sustainable Commercial 
Paper (CP) notes program. We expect to have $300 million to $650 million 
of sustainable CP notes outstanding at any given point. It is our intention to 
have most disbursements or allocations to eligible projects be used toward 
socioeconomic advancement and empowerment. To further support our 
initiative, one of the program dealers is a minority-owned firm.

The CRO actively and independently provides risk 
management oversight, including discussing levels of 
risk tolerance and risk acceptance within the business 
units. ERM works with business unit subject matter 
experts to identify and characterize key risks, including 
those related to climate and the environment. The 
ERA and business unit combined risk reviews look 
at short- and medium-term risks through the risk 
register process. For medium-term, climate-related 
transition risks, the risk register process also overlays 
jurisdictional resource plans, which projects out 10 
to 20 years, depending on the jurisdiction. Longer-
term risks are identified and managed through the 
Enterprise Strategy and Planning group’s tracking of 
longer-term trends.

For the near and medium term, we engage 
stakeholders on inputs to our integrated resource 
plans, we hold many public stakeholder meetings 
that any interested party can attend and weigh in, 
including with industrial groups, environmental groups, 
and the state public utilities commission. 

The filings consider forecasts of potential future 
climate policies, future electricity demand, fuel prices, 
transmission improvements, new generating capacity 
and technologies, integration of renewables, energy 
storage, energy efficiency, and demand response 
initiatives. On the natural gas side of our business, we 
incorporate methane goals into our business strategy 
and keep the commission informed about our efforts.

Political Involvement

Our clean energy transformation requires partnering 
with stakeholders and championing durable public 
policies at the state, local and federal levels. This 
allows us to better transition our generating fleet, 
expand and adapt our electric grid and adopt new 
carbon-free technologies to reduce emissions and 
keep energy affordable and reliable. 

It is essential for us to engage in public policy 
discussions to advocate for the interests of our 
customers and other stakeholders.

Policy Engagement

The year 2022 was momentous for policy issues 
affiliated with climate and sustainability. We engaged 
in bipartisan discussions at the international, national 
and regional levels.

	 Worked with organizations like C2ES, Business 
Roundtable, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, EEI, 
the Nuclear Energy Institute, Business Forward,

	 Hosted members of the U.S. House of Representatives from across the 

country, their staffs, and state legislators on facility tours. 

Political Giving 

The Corporate Governance Committee reviews the company’s political 
expenditures twice a year, as well as the processes and priorities related 
to those political expenditures. The Corporate Governance Committee also 
reviews stakeholder feedback regarding our political expenditures and the 
alignment of our lobbying practices with our climate goals. 

In response to this feedback, in 2022, we: 

Updated our Political Expenditures Policy to provide additional disclosures, beginning with the Corporate Political 
Expenditures Report for the first half of 2022 regarding certain contributions and dues to 501(c)(4)s and 501(c)(6)s.

	 Published our third Trade Association Climate Review, one which discusses the alignment of our major trade 

associations’ positions on climate change with ours. You can find our full Trade Association Climate disclosure

Trade Association Engagement

Duke Energy has transitioned our stand-alone Trade Association 
Climate Review to an appendix within our annual Impact 
Report. Our intent is to provide more efficient transparency 
with the updated format.

To achieve our clean energy transformation and net-zero goals 
that we believe to be consistent with the Paris Agreement, 
it is essential for us to engage in public policy discussions 
at the local, state, and federal levels – both on our own and 
through trade associations – to advocate for the interests of our 
customers, shareholders, employees and communities. 

Trade associations collectively represent the views of many 
businesses and can therefore in many cases be more efficient 
in presenting those views to policymakers than can each 
business individually. These groups also provide valuable 
forums for sharing best practices and technical information, as 
well as setting technical standards and developing disclosure-
related standards (including climate disclosure standards) for 
industry sectors.

We recognize that, as member-driven organizations, trade 
associations take positions that reflect the consensus views of 
their members. As such, we work hard to harmonize our trade 
associations’ positions and advocacy for climate policy with 
those of Duke Energy and with the Paris Agreement.

Duke Energy has long advocated for climate change policies 
that will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions. We support market-based approaches that balance 
environmental protection with affordability, reliability and 
economic vitality. We seek to ensure that the policies adopted 

to achieve emission reduction goals are cost-effective, market-
based and equitable; promote a broad range of technology 
development; and include provisions to efficiently address 
greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the economy.

Duke Energy’s Political Expenditures Committee (PEC), 
alongside other senior leaders across the company, such 
as our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and our Chief 
Governance Officer.

Because of the diversity of members in our trade associations, 
we may not align in strategy in all cases, or support each 
initiative or position of every organization in which we 
participate. In those cases, we proactively attempt to prevent 
potential misalignment of trade association positions on climate 
change with our positions and lobbying priorities. In our 
experience, staying engaged in dialogue with those who may 
hold positions different from ours allows us to test assumptions, 
clarify views and challenge differences in opinions. This can 
result in a more meaningful and positive outcome than simply 
abandoning a relationship. However, if, despite Duke Energy’s 
efforts, a trade association takes a position on a climate-
related topic that is materially misaligned with ours, we would 
consider that misalignment in the broad context of all business 
issues facing our company that the trade association covers, 
then determine whether continued participation in the trade 
association is in the best interest of the company, its investors, 
and its customers.

Governance

Our company has a strong governance structure, starting 
with the Board of Directors, to manage climate-related 
risks. Read more about our climate governance in our 2022 
Climate Report.

The Board of Director’s Corporate Governance Committee 
oversees the company’s policies and practices with respect to 
political contributions, legislative lobbying and political activities 
on the local, state and federal levels. Jurisdictional presidents 
at each applicable state level and the Vice President, Federal 
Government Affairs, manage public policy policies, practices 
and strategy on a day-to-day basis. They also make up  

The PEC is responsible for developing the company’s annual 
political expenditures strategy and approving, monitoring and 
tracking our political expenditures. Our Political Expenditures 
Policy sets out the principles governing our corporate political 
expenditures and the contributions of Duke Energy’s employee-
funded political action committee and is reviewed by the PEC 
regularly. In addition, management provides a semiannual 
update to the Corporate Governance Committee of the 
board on the company’s strategy and political expenditures, 
including payments to trade associations and other tax-
exempt organizations.

In 2020, we expanded the practices covered by the policy 
to include the engagement of political consultants to conduct 
external lobbying and began listing the titles of the company’s 
PEC members who are responsible for the management, 
oversight and approval of political activities. In 2021, we 
revised our Political Expenditures Policy to enhance the 
transparency of our disclosures. 

We regularly review our policies and procedures related to 
political expenditures to ensure best practices and, as a result, 
we have made several enhancements to our policies and 
disclosures in recent years.

To determine which trade associations to include in the Trade 
Association Climate Review, we use criteria similar to those 
we have adopted in our corporate political expenditure reports. 
That is, we report here on trade associations and chambers of 
commerce for which our dues exceeded $50,000 in 2022 and 
which indicated they engaged in federal lobbying in 2022.

American Clean 
Power Association 
(ACP) 

ACP is a trade organization that became operational as of January 2021. The Energy 
Storage Association merged into ACP effective January 2022. ACP states that it is the 
“leading federation of renewable energy companies expediting the advancement of clean 
energy as the dominant power source in America.”

ACP states that it supports “policies that will remove barriers and accelerate growth in 
America’s renewable energy industry.” 

American Gas  
Association (AGA)

AGA’s position on climate is that America’s natural gas industry will be essential to achieve 
a net-zero emissions future. It states that “climate change is a defining challenge across the 
globe, and natural gas, natural gas utilities, and the delivery infrastructure are essential to 
meeting our nation’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.”

In February 2022, AGA published a study entitled “Net-Zero Emissions Opportunities for 
Gas Utilities” that details how natural gas, natural gas utilities and delivery infrastructure 
will be essential to meeting America’s greenhouse as emissions reduction goals, including 
achieving net-zero emissions.

In February 2023, AGA published a study that assesses policies that could be used to 
establish regulatory frameworks for incentivizing the production and use of low-carbon 
gas resources at scale, stating, “this study leaves no doubt that low-carbon gas resources 
and natural gas infrastructure can be a powerful tool in lowering carbon emissions while 
keeping energy affordable for customers.”

Summary of  
Duke Energy’s engagement 

In 2022, Duke Energy was 
represented on ACP’s board of 
directors by the Senior Vice President 
and President of Duke Energy

The Business 
Roundtable (BRT)  

BRT’s climate page states: “Unchecked, climate poses significant environmental, economic, 
public health and security threats to countries around the world, including the United 
States. Business Roundtable believes corporations should lead by example, support sound 
public policies and drive the innovation needed to address climate change.”

BRT’s climate policy states: “Because the consequences of global warming for society and 
ecosystems are potentially serious and far-reaching, the Business Roundtable believes that 
steps to address the risks of such warming are prudent and supports collective actions that 
will lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on a global basis.” It also states that 
“to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world must work together to limit global 
temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, 
consistent with the Paris Agreement,” and notes that in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees 
Celsius compared to preindustrial levels will be necessary to avoid some of the most severe 
risks associated with climate change. 

In August 2022, in response to the consideration of the IRA, BRT stated that it supported 
the bill’s climate provisions.

labor unions. We have a grievance 
process in place for our represented 
employees and each collective 
bargaining agreement allows for a 
review of various employment actions 
through this formal process. The 
Employee Rights Under National 
Labor Relations Act notice is posted 
in our locations and available 
online with our Human Relations 
policies. We fully support freedom 
of association as described by the

We cannot precisely determine

service comes from recycled sources. 
A portion of steel, aluminum, other 
metals and plastics may come from 
recycled sources, and we actively 
pursue recycling of these materials 
when their useful life has been 
reached. Nearly all fuel used is virgin 
material, because sufficient volumes of 
recycled fuels are not available.

Statement Regarding Renewable Energy Certificates 

Duke Energy’s subsidiary electric utilities generate power from 

solar, hydroelectric and biomass (including waste to energy) 

resources, but do not always retain all of the environmental 

claims, including renewable energy certificates (RECs), related 

to such generation. The RECs and other environmental claims 

associated with such generation may be used to meet statutory 

or regulatory compliance obligations (on behalf of the respective 

electric utility and certain wholesale customers), assigned 

to customers pursuant to retail programs or sold/traded via 

bilateral commercial agreements. Duke Energy’s electric utilities 

also buy power through purchased power agreements (PPAs) 

from solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass (including waste 

to energy) resources. Under certain PPAs for energy from such 

resources, the electric utilities purchase both the energy and 

the associated environmental claims (including RECs). Under 

other PPAs, including some of those entered into pursuant to 

the electric utilities’ respective obligations under the Public 

Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), Duke Energy 

does not purchase any RECs associated with the energy. 

Under PPAs entered into by Duke Energy’s electric utilities 

pursuant to certain retail customer programs, such utilities 

purchase environmental claims (including RECs) associated 

with the energy and convey to customers participating in 

identified programs, or retire on their behalf, some or all of 

the environmental claims (including RECs). Duke Energy’s 

subsidiary Duke Energy Renewables sells the electricity and/or 

RECs it generates to its customers.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-
LOOKING INFORMATION

events, and to earn an adequate return on investment 
through rate case proceedings and the regulatory process;

This document includes forward-looking statements within 
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and 
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-
looking statements are based on management’s beliefs and 
assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases 
that include “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” 
“expect,” “continue,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “plan,” 
“project,” “predict,” “will,” “potential,” “forecast,” “target,” 
“guidance,” “outlook” or other similar terminology. Various 
factors may cause actual results to be materially different than 
the suggested outcomes within forward-looking statements; 
accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be 
realized. These factors include, but are not limited to:

	 The ability to implement our business strategy, including our 

carbon emission reduction goals;

	 State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory 

initiatives, including costs of compliance with existing and 
future environmental requirements, including those related 
to climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and 
investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or 
market prices;

	 The extent and timing of costs and liabilities to comply with 
federal and state laws, regulations and legal requirements 
related to coal ash remediation, including amounts for 
required closure of certain ash impoundments, are uncertain 
and difficult to estimate;

	 The costs of decommissioning nuclear facilities could prove to 
be more extensive than amounts estimated and all costs may 
not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process;

	 The impact of extraordinary external events, such as the 
pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19, and 
their collateral consequences, including the disruption 
of global supply chains or the economic activity in our 
service territories;

	 Costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, 

settlements, investigations and claims;

	 Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in 

service territories or customer bases resulting from sustained 
downturns of the economy, reduced customer usage due to 
cost pressures from inflation or fuel costs, and the economic 
health of our service territories or variations in customer 
usage patterns, including energy efficiency efforts, natural gas 
building and appliance electrification, and use of alternative 
energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed 
generation technologies;

	 Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts 

designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency 
measures, natural gas electrification, and distributed 
generation technologies, such as private solar and battery 
storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in a 
reduced number of customers, excess generation resources 
as well as stranded costs;

	 The ability to recover eligible costs, including amounts 

associated with coal ash impoundment retirement obligations, 
asset retirement and construction costs related to carbon 
emissions reductions, and costs related to significant weather 

	 Advancements in technology;

	 Additional competition in electric and natural gas markets 

and continued industry consolidation;

	 The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on 
operations, including the economic, operational and other 
effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes 
and tornadoes, including extreme weather associated with 
climate change;

	 Changing investor, customer and other stakeholder 

expectations and demands including heightened emphasis 
on environmental, social and governance concerns and costs 
related thereto;

	 The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities 
and deliver electricity to customers including direct or indirect 
effects to the company resulting from an incident that affects 
the United States electric grid or generating resources;

	 Operational interruptions to our natural gas distribution and 

transmission activities;

	 The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation 

capacity and natural gas supply;

	 The impact on facilities and business from a terrorist or other 
attack, war, vandalism, cybersecurity threats, data security 
breaches, operational events, information technology failures 
or other catastrophic events, such as fires, explosions, 
pandemic health events or other similar occurrences;

	 The inherent risks associated with the operation of nuclear 
facilities, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory 
and financial risks, including the financial stability of third-
party service providers;

	 The timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and 
interest rates and the ability to recover such costs through 
the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact 
on liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; 

	 The results of financing efforts, including the ability to 

	 The ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to 

obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected 
by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate 
fluctuations, compliance with debt covenants and conditions, 
an individual utility’s generation mix, and general market and 
economic conditions;

	 Credit ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants may be 

different from what is expected;

	 Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed-income 

securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined 
benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and 
nuclear decommissioning trust funds;

	 Construction and development risks associated with 

the completion of the Duke Energy Registrants’ capital 
investment projects, including risks related to financing, 
timing and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, 
obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting 
construction budgets and schedules and satisfying operating 
and environmental performance standards, as well as the 
ability to recover costs from customers in a timely manner, or 
at all;

	 Changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, 
including changes in rate designs and new and evolving 
capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by 
the default of other participants;

	 The ability to control operation and maintenance costs;

	 The level of creditworthiness of counterparties 

to transactions;

	 The ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs;

	 Employee workforce factors, including the potential inability 

to attract and retain key personnel;

Duke Energy Corporation holding company (the Parent);

	 The performance of projects undertaken by our nonregulated 

businesses and the success of efforts to invest in and develop 
new opportunities, as well as the successful sale of the 
Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups;

	 The effect of accounting and reporting pronouncements 

issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies and 
the SEC;

	 The impact of United States tax legislation to our financial 

condition, results of operations or cash flows and our 
credit ratings;

	 The impacts from potential impairments of goodwill or equity 

method investment carrying values;

	 Asset or business acquisitions and dispositions may not yield 

the anticipated benefits; and

	 The actions of activist shareholders could disrupt our 

operations, impact our ability to execute on our business 
strategy, or cause fluctuations in the trading price of our 
common stock.

Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed 
in the Duke Energy Registrants' reports filed with the SEC 
and available at the SEC's website at sec.gov. In light of these 
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described 
in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might 
occur to a different extent or at a different time than described. 
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they 
are made and the Duke Energy Registrants expressly disclaim 
an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new information, future 
events or otherwise.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

NON-GAAP MEASURES

Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Duke Energy’s 2022 Impact Report references adjusted EPS for the 
year-to-date periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $5.27, 
$4.99 respectively.

The non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EPS, represents basic EPS 
from continuing operations available to Duke Energy Corporation common 
stockholders (GAAP reported EPS), adjusted for the per share impact of 
special items. As discussed below, special items represent certain charges 
and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy’s 
ongoing performance.

Management believes the presentation of adjusted EPS provides useful 
information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant 
comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management 
uses this non-GAAP financial measure for planning and forecasting and for 
reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of Directors, employees, 
stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted EPS is also used as a basis for 
employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measure 
for adjusted EPS is reported basic EPS available to Duke Energy Corporation 
common stockholders.

Special items included in the periods presented include the following items, 
which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

	 Regulatory matters and litigation represents the net impact of charges 

related to Indiana court rulings on coal ash and other unrelated 
ongoing litigation.

	 Workplace and workforce realignment represents costs attributable to 

business transformation, including long-term real estate strategy changes 
and workforce reduction.

	 Regulatory settlements represents an impairment charge related to the South Carolina Supreme Court decision on 

coal ash, insurance proceeds and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress coal ash settlement.

	 Gas pipeline investments represents additional exit obligations related to ACP.

Discontinued operations primarily includes results from Duke Energy’s Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups, 
including an estimated impairment on the sale of the business in 2022.

Duke Energy’s adjusted EPS may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other 
entities may not calculate the measure in the same manner.
