BUILDING BRIDGES TO A LOW-CARBON FUTURE

2007|2008
Sustainability Report

Our Mission

We make people’s lives better by providing gas and 
electric services in a sustainable way. This requires  
us to constantly look for ways to improve, to grow  
and to reduce our impact on the environment.

OUR DIRECTION IN 2008 AND BEyOND

  By running our business well and 

We must pursue a balanced approach  
to meeting future energy needs.

In pursuing new supply options, we 
consider whether they are available, 
affordable, reliable and clean. By 
carefully balancing these criteria, we 
can make the best decisions for our 
customers and our company.

  Our options include energy efficiency, 
coal gasification, advanced pulverized 
coal, nuclear, natural gas-fired genera-
tion and renewable energy.

We must balance the reality of a carbon-
constrained future with our customers’ 
energy demands.

  Environmental legislation will signifi-
cantly affect Duke Energy. We aim 
for fairness for our customers and 
shareholders.

In our regulated and commercial 
businesses, we will pursue low-carbon 
solutions – like clean coal and natural 
gas – and no-carbon solutions – like 
nuclear and renewable energy. We  
will also pursue innovative energy 
efficiency and utility of the future 
(advanced power grid) initiatives.

  We will push for the development of 
new technologies to reduce carbon 
emissions. Until those technologies  
are available, we will meet demand 
with current options.

We must find the path to success  
during this era of rising costs.

  We expect to see increased costs from 
modernizing our grid and developing 
new generation. We will effectively 
manage the costs of these and other 
capital projects.

providing excellent customer service, 
we can minimize price impacts to our 
customers and maintain the financial 
health of the company.

We must deliver on our commitments.

  We will steadily grow earnings – 
making our company attractive  
to investors – and achieve our 
employee incentive target of  
$1.27 per ongoing diluted share.

  We will continue to balance  

our regulated and commercial  
investments based on the  
business environment.

  We will strive to be “simply the best.”

ABOUT ThIS REpORT:

In 2007, we published Duke Energy’s first sustainability plan 
and report following the company’s merger with Cinergy. This 
2007|2008 Sustainability Report updates our performance 
against our five-year sustainability plan.

The fold out on pages 10-13 provides Duke Energy’s 
sustainability plan “at a glance” as well as our management 
approach. The content in the rest of this publication was 
selected to build on – rather than repeat – information from 
the 2006|2007 report. On the pages that follow, we report on 
our 2007 progress, highlight significant developments toward 
achieving our sustainability goals and address the issues that 
our stakeholders tell us are most important to them. Additional 
information and updates to data in this report are available on 
www.duke-energy.com.

A broad index to the Global reporting Initiative (GrI) 
indicators is on page 41. A more detailed index to the GrI 
indicators can be found at www.duke-energy.com/environment/
sustainability.asp. With this report and the information on  
our Web site, we believe we meet GrI Application level B.
Over the past year, we have made progress integrating 

sustainability into our core 
business. The company’s 
recently updated mission 
statement now explicitly 
references sustainability. 
And, Duke Energy’s 2007 
Summary Annual Report 
and this Sustainability 
Report share a common 
theme – “building bridges 
to a low-carbon future.”  
Both publications  
review our response  
to the imperative to 
reduce greenhouse  
gas emissions.

letter from the Chairman

Dear Stakeholders:

This year, our 2007|2008 Sustainability 
Report and 2007 Summary Annual 
Report share a common theme: building 
bridges to a low-carbon future. I think this 
illustrates how integral sustainability has 
become to our company. Sustainability 
issues are bedrock business issues for 
Duke Energy.

A commitment to sustainability recog-
nizes that our company is not measured  
by financial results alone. We must also  
be responsible stewards of the environment 
and responsive to the changing expecta-
tions of our stakeholders. We work hard  
to strike the right balance between 
economic, environmental and social 
considerations – a goal that is imprecise, 
subjective and essential to the continued 
viability of our company and our world. 

From both a sustainability and business 

standpoint, global climate change is the 
most pressing and complex issue we are 
facing. It challenges our inventiveness and 
technology. It challenges our policies and 
diplomacy. It challenges the balance of 
our economies and environment. And it 
challenges our humanity. 

As the third largest emitter of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) in the U.S., we recognize 
our special responsibility to be part of 
the solution to global climate change. We 
have deep expertise in energy production, 
distribution and use, and a long legacy of 
leadership. 

Conversations with you, our stake-
holders, have challenged us to lead in  
this area. And at every level of our 
corporation – from our board of directors 
to our operating staff – we are challenging 
ourselves to respond.  

From a policy perspective, we continue 

our leadership role in the U.S. Climate 
Action Partnership, a coalition of compa-
nies and other organizations committed 
to a cap-and-trade approach to lowering 
carbon emissions. We have also testified 
twice before Congress and have spoken at 
countless business and industry forums. 
recognizing the global reach of the issue, 
I have had the opportunity to address the 
United Nations and the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development to 
advance our policy priorities.

A BOLD ChALLENGE: CUT CO2 
EmISSIONS IN hALF By 2030

While legislation is being debated, we 
are taking action within our company to 
prepare for a low-carbon future.

I have challenged our team to try to cut 
our CO2 emissions in half by 2030 – while 
maintaining the reliability and competitive 
prices that our customers expect of us.  
It is a bold aspiration – an overarching 
sustainability objective – that I expect 
will spark breakthrough thinking by our 
employees and our business partners.  

To be clear – no CEO can predict results 

two quarters from now – let alone two 
decades from now. What is also clear is 
that achieving significant carbon reduc-
tions over the next two decades will require 
more than incremental change. We need 
a whole new way of thinking about energy 
– how we generate it and how we use it. 
It will mean investing in new energy infra-
structure, and redesigning our business 
model and our regulatory framework to 
span the gulf between today’s conventional 
wisdom and tomorrow’s possibilities. It will 
mean finding new ways to create value for 
our customers and other stakeholders in a 
low-carbon world.

Can we reduce our carbon emissions by 

more than 50 million tons by 2030 while 
preserving our customers’ competitiveness 
and the strength of our business? We don’t 
know the answer to that question... yet.
Beginning on page 8, we share 
one possible scenario where we can 
accomplish those objectives – if all of 
our planning assumptions prove true. 
The considerations and assumptions that 
guide our work vividly demonstrate both 
the complexity of the issue – and the 
need to consider all sustainability criteria 
– economic, environmental and social 
factors. In the months and years ahead, we 
will continue to collaborate with our many 
stakeholders to better inform our planning.

BUILDING BRIDGES TO  
A LOW-CARBON FUTURE 

Here are some highlights of our 

progress in 2007:

In our 2007 Summary Annual Report, 
you can read about some of the people 
who will be guiding Duke Energy through 
this transformative period of change. We 
believe the bridges to a low-carbon future 
will be built on new and improved technol-
ogy, enabling public policy, and customers 
who use energy more efficiently and are 
“carbon literate” in all aspects of their 
lives. One measure of our commitment is 
that, over the next five years, we plan to 
invest approximately $23 billion to make 
our system more efficient, retire inefficient 
plants and increase renewable generation. 
On the pages that follow, we discuss 
our progress in each of these areas, using 
the framework of our sustainability goals 
and objectives.

DUkE ENERGy’S  
SUSTAINABILITy pLAN

While carbon reduction is the centerpiece 
of our sustainability plan, we affect our 
world in many other ways. Duke Energy’s 
sustainability plan has five areas of focus:

  Provide innovative products and 

services for a carbon-constrained, 
competitive world 

  reduce our environmental footprint

  Attract and retain a diverse,  

high-quality workforce

  Help build strong communities

  Be profitable and demonstrate strong 

governance and transparency

products and Services
By the year 2030, U.S. demand for 
electricity is expected to grow by  
approximately 35 percent – even more  
in high-growth regions like the Carolinas. 
In deciding how to generate electricity  
to serve our customers, we ask ourselves 
four questions: 

Is the technology available?

Is it affordable?

Is it reliable?

Is it clean?

Most of the electricity produced today 

comes from four fuels: coal, nuclear, 
natural gas and water. As we build bridges 
to a low-carbon future, we think we should 
focus as much on the demand side of  
the equation – how our customers use 
electricity – as we have traditionally 
focused on the supply side – how we 
generate it. That’s why we’ve come to 
think of energy efficiency as the “fifth fuel.” 
In 2007, we developed a business 
model around energy efficiency – the  
save-a-watt model – and filed for regulatory 
approval in North Carolina, South Carolina 
and Indiana. We will be filing the plan with 
state regulators in Ohio and kentucky in 
2008. 

New york Times columnist Tom 
Friedman called our save-a-watt model 
“the mother of all energy paradigm shifts.” 
It creates a whole new business model  
for utilities – where we would be compen-
sated for saving watts just as we are for 
producing them. 

This sea change in our business model 
will be sparked by dramatic technological 
change – beginning with the transforma-
tion of our power delivery system. Over the 
next five years, we plan to invest almost 
$1 billion in smart grid technology. These 
innovations in technology and regulatory 
policy support our vision of helping make 
the communities we serve the most energy 
efficient in the world.

Environmental Footprint
A key objective in last year’s sustainability 
plan was to improve our environmental 
goals. This year, you’ll see improved 
measures for air, water and waste that 
will drive reductions in our environmental 
footprint. 

In 2007, we increased our owner-
ship of renewable energy. In May, we 
acquired the wind assets of Tierra Energy. 
The purchase included more than 1,000 
megawatts of wind assets under develop-
ment in the western and southwestern 
U.S. Additionally, we issued requests for 
proposals in the Carolinas and Indiana 
to meet energy demand with a greater 
amount of renewable energy, including 
wind, biomass, solar power and hydro.

Indiana regulators approved our four-
year plan to build a cleaner-coal integrated 
gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant.  
The 630-megawatt (MW) Edwardsport 
plant is currently expected to cost approxi-
mately $2 billion. To encourage this new 
technology, the project will receive $460 
million in local, state and federal tax  
incentives and credits.

“One measure of our commitment is that, over the next five years, we 

plan to invest approximately $23 billion to make our system more 

efficient, retire inefficient plants and increase renewables generation.”

The new plant will be one of the 

cleanest and most efficient coal-fired power 
plants in the world. It will emit less sulfur 
dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
particulates than the plant it replaces – 
while providing more than 10 times the 
power of the existing plant. The current 
160-MW plant emits about 13,000 tons 
of SO2, NOx and particulates annually 
and runs about 30 percent of the time. By 
comparison, a new 630-MW IGCC plant 
running 100 percent of the time will emit 
about 2,900 tons of the same pollutants.  
It will also use about 11 million gallons  
of water a day, compared to the current 
plant, which uses almost 190 million 
gallons daily.

Eventually, we hope to be able to 
capture and permanently store the CO2 
emitted from this plant in nearby under-
ground formations, keeping it out of the 
atmosphere.

I cannot write this letter without 
addressing the Cliffside Modernization 
Project and the new, 800-MW advanced 
pulverized coal unit – Unit 6 – at the site.  
In late January 2008, we received final 
approval from state regulators to proceed 
with construction.

During the approval process, we were 
criticized by some for proposing the plant 
in light of our views on climate change.  
While I recognize that it appears counter-
intuitive to reduce emissions by building 
a new coal plant, here are some of the 
benefits of the Cliffside project: 

  Once Unit 6 is completed, the modern-

ized Cliffside plant is expected to 
generate over twice the electricity of the 
existing five units, but emit one-seventh 

of the SO2, one-third of the NOx and 
one-half of the mercury compared to 
the units there today.

   We have worked with state regulators 
to develop a first-of-its-kind carbon 
mitigation plan under which we will 
retire approximately 1,000 MW of 
older, less efficient coal-fired plants and 
take additional actions to make Cliffside 
6 “carbon neutral” by 2018.

   The new unit’s air permit includes  

limits on SO2 and NOx emissions that 
are stricter than current state and 
federal rules. The state’s mercury limits 
are already more stringent than federal 
mercury rules. The project will receive 
$125 million in federal clean-coal  
tax credits.

We view the improved environmental 
efficiency of Cliffside 6, coupled with this 
carbon mitigation plan, as an important 
bridge to new technology. We’re not 
building an IGCC plant in North Carolina 
because the geology there is not suitable 
for carbon sequestration. Cliffside 6 will 
likely be the last new coal plant we build 
in North Carolina for at least 20 years. By 
then, we expect carbon capture technology 
to advance so it can be used on virtually 
any coal plant, regardless of the geology.
In 2007, we also announced plans 
to build more than 1,200 MW of natural 
gas-fired plants in North Carolina so 
that we can meet the region’s increasing 
demand and retire some of our older  
coal units. 

We are also applying our more than 30 

years of safe nuclear operations experi-
ence to plan a new, 2,234-MW nuclear 

station in South Carolina. We applied for 
a construction and operating license for 
the plant with the U.S. Nuclear regulatory 
Commission in December 2007. Nuclear 
energy produces no greenhouse gas 
emissions and it has a proven record for 
safety and reliability. But, the used fuel 
issue remains unresolved. While the U.S. 
government continues to debate a decision 
on long-term storage facilities for used fuel, 
we are exploring other alternatives, includ-
ing fuel recycling.

For many of our customers, 2007 may 
be remembered as the year of the drought. 
It was one of the driest years on record in 
our Carolinas service area, which tested 
our ability to balance electric generating 
requirements with other community water 
needs. Under Duke Energy’s coordination, 
a new collaborative of municipalities, water 
utilities, large industrials and resource 
agencies was formed to manage through 
the drought by sharing information, 
responding with conservation measures 
and contingency planning. In the year 
ahead, we will conduct water balance 
surveys in the areas we serve with stressed 
water supply to improve our manage-
ment and use of this increasingly scarce 
resource.

Quality Workforce
It is almost a corporate cliché to say 
“employees are our greatest asset,” but it  
is also true: Talent is a key differentiator. 
With the major changes facing our 
industry and our estimate that we will have 
to replace about one-third of our workforce 
in the next five years, we are taking a  
number of aggressive actions to preserve 
Duke Energy’s talent advantage:

6

  We are building a corporate culture 

centered on sustainability. By making 
sustainability part of our “corporate 
DNA,” we believe it will spark innova-
tion and aid in recruitment. 

  We are rethinking the way we work and 
our workplace practices, broadening 
telecommuting, improving employee 
training, and promoting employee 
health and wellness.

Safety remains a cornerstone of  
our company and we measure our  
safety performance against a goal of  
zero fatalities. 

  With sadness, I must report two 

fatalities in 2007. These fatalities 
overshadow every other aspect of  
our performance and deepen our 
resolve to improve. 

In that spirit, we completed 2007 with 
a 17 percent improvement in our Total 
Incident Case rate – an important 
indicator of safety. This means that we 
ended the year with 65 fewer employee 
injuries than in 2006.

Strong Communities
The success of Duke Energy is inextricably 
linked to the success of the communities 
we serve. 

In 2007, we worked with economic 

development officials to help attract 
approximately $3.7 billion in capital 
investment and 15,270 new jobs to the 
five-state region we serve – vastly exceed-
ing our goals. And, we awarded approxi-
mately $18 million in charitable grants 
within our service areas.

Governance and Transparency
For a company to be sustainable over  
the long term, it must be profitable. We 
ended 2007 with $1.24 in ongoing  
diluted earnings per share. Total share-
holder return, that is, change in stock price 
plus dividends, was more than 9 percent.

We participate in a number of efforts to 

benchmark and improve our governance 
practices and company performance. 
In 2007, we saw significant improve-
ment in our corporate governance ratings 
by riskMetrics Group (formerly ISS 
Governance Services). We began the year 
with very low rankings and ended among 
the leaders, both among companies in 
general and within the utility industry.  
And, we were again included in the  
2007 Dow Jones Sustainability Index  
for North America.

Collaboration, communication and 
stakeholder engagement are key attributes 
of a successful, sustainable business. your 
feedback and diverse viewpoints make us 
better. I invite you to contact us via our 
Web site, www.duke-energy.com, to let us 
know what you think about our sustain-
ability plan and progress. With your input 
and support, we can build stronger and 
more lasting bridges to a low-carbon and 
sustainable future. 

Sincerely,

WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Duke Energy was invited to become  
a member of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development. 
The Council provides a forum for 
companies to explore sustainable 
development; to share knowledge, 
experiences and best practices; and 
to advocate business positions on 
sustainable development issues.

EEI ADVOCACY  
EXCELLENCE AWARD
In January 2008, Duke Energy 
received the prestigious Advocacy 
Excellence Award from the Edison 
Electric Institute, the trade associa-
tion for investor-owned electric 
utilities. We were recognized for our 
comprehensive program to promote 
energy efficiency at the federal, state 
and local levels. A departure from 
traditional regulatory approaches, 
Duke Energy’s model rewards the 
company only for energy efficiency 
results. Customers who actively 
participate in the programs would 
reduce their power bills – enough  
to more than offset program costs.

2030 Challenge

Can Duke Energy cut its carbon dioxide (C02) 
emissions in half between 2006 and 2030? 

Approximately 70 percent of the electricity 
that Duke Energy generates in the U.S. 
comes from coal-burning power plants. 
The remaining 30 percent comes from 
lower or zero carbon emitting sources such 
as nuclear, natural gas and hydropower.

A large number of our coal plants are 
located in the Midwest, an area that has 
an abundant supply of consistently priced, 
low-cost coal. Decisions to build these 
plants were driven by the price and avail-
ability of domestic coal and were made 
before there were concerns about climate 
change.

As part of our strategic planning 
process, we develop core beliefs and 
assumptions that drive our scenario 
planning. Here are just some of those 
considerations:

2030 SCENARIO

Our initial work has resulted in one possible scenario that would enable us to cut our 
2006 CO2 emissions in half – by approximately 50 million tons – by 2030, while meeting 
our customers’ increasing demands for electricity. This scenario is a first step to help us 
better understand the carbon emissions challenge we may face. Under this scenario, we 
would take all of the following actions in the Midwest and Carolinas:

ImpLICATIONS AND NExT STEpS

Here are a few key implications of this 
scenario:

  New generation must be built:  
A considerable amount of new 
generation – approximately 18,500 
megawatts, or 55 percent, of our 
current installed capacity – would have 
to be built between now and 2030. 

  Nuclear must make a comeback:  

A significant portion of the new genera-
tion would need to be nuclear, making 
it imperative for us to have nuclear as  
a supply option. 

  High hopes for carbon capture and 

sequestration: This scenario anticipates 
the commercial availability of carbon 
capture and sequestration technology. 

  Much larger role for energy efficiency, 
renewables and natural gas: Energy 
efficiency, renewables and natural  
gas would have to play a much larger 
role in our supply portfolio than they  
do today.

  Customer rates could increase  

significantly: Customer rates, with  
inflation included, could increase  
70 to 120 percent. The increase could 
be even larger if CO2 allowances have 
to be purchased.

This work represents one possible 
scenario to significantly reduce our carbon 
emissions. Technology, customer expecta-
tions and public policy are constantly 
changing, and our planning must be 
equally agile. We will continue to improve 
our assumptions and analyses based on 
new developments and input from our 
many stakeholders. We are committed to 
stretching our creativity and thinking to 
build bridges to a low-carbon future.

Duke Energy Sustainability  
Plan and Progress at a Glance

This sustainability plan reflects  
Duke energy’s commitment to operate 
our company in a way that is good for 
people, the planet and profits. It recog-
nizes and addresses the key economic, 
environmental and social opportunities 
and risks facing our industry today and 
in the future. The plan expands on the 
company’s business strategy and values. 
It does not focus on every sustainability 
initiative at Duke energy – and there  
are many. 

Instead, we focus on the areas that 
are most material from a sustainability 
perspective. We listen and incorporate 
feedback from our stakeholders into  
this plan and review it each year to 
reflect new developments. unless other-
wise noted, our intent is to achieve the 
goals in this plan by 2012. The progress 
we have made so far is summarized at 
the right. A detailed description of our 
progress against these goals can be  
found in the following pages of this

Energy efficiency  
as the “fifth fuel”

Energy is the lifeline of our economy, 
and Duke Energy’s core business is 
meeting the electricity and gas needs of its 
customers. According to U.S. Department 
of Energy statistics, electricity demand 
is expected to increase by approximately 
35 percent by 2030, even higher in fast 
growing regions like the Carolinas.

The traditional answer to rising electric-
ity demand has been to increase supply – 
to build more power plants fueled by coal, 
natural gas, nuclear and renewables. We 
believe that energy efficiency can play 
an important role in reducing customer 
demand – becoming the “fifth fuel.” And, 
because the cleanest power plant is the 
one that is never built, we believe that 
energy efficiency is the greatest untapped 
resource in reducing greenhouse gases in 
the near term.

Of course, energy efficiency isn’t a  
new idea. Utilities have offered demand-
side programs for years – with varied 
results. In 2007, Duke Energy worked 
with a number of stakeholders and  
industry peers to develop a different  
model – the save-a-watt model – so  
that energy efficiency can become an 
important bridge to a low-carbon future.

“Saving energy should be as much a part of a utility’s  

mission as generating and delivering electricity.”   

 – Jim rogers

THE SAVE-A-WATT MODEL
Duke Energy’s save-a-watt model starts with a simple premise: the most efficient  
and environmentally sound plant is the one we don’t have to build.  
The save-a-watt model proposes the following regulatory changes:
  We would earn a rate of return based on about 85 to 90 percent of what it would 
have cost to build and operate a plant to produce the amount of electricity the 
program saves. Under this plan, all customers will receive an approximate 10  
to 15 percent discount, even if they do not participate in an efficiency program. 

  Duke Energy will be rewarded only for energy savings actually realized by 

customers. Each year, an independent auditor will verify actual energy savings 
achieved through energy efficiency programs.

SAVE-A-WATT ENDORSEMENTS
Three national advocacy groups have reached agreement with Duke Energy to support 
the save-a-watt model. The Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an 
Energy-Efficient Economy and the Energy Future Coalition endorse the initiative as  
“an innovative and promising new direction for the company and its customers.”  
While supporting the save-a-watt model, the advocacy groups will look to regulators  
in each state to determine an appropriate and reasonable level of compensation.

How save-a-watt  
will work

The goal of Duke Energy’s save-a-watt 
model is to help our customers save energy 
– and money – and still earn a return for 
our investors. Under current regulations, 
utilities make money by earning a return 
on their investment in physical assets such 
as power plants, poles and wires, and by 
charging customers for each kilowatt-hour 
of electricity they use. Under the save-a-
watt model, we would be allowed to earn 
a return on our investments that help 
customers save energy.

In essence, the save-a-watt model 
treats investments in energy efficiency 
just like investments in a new generating 
station – removing the regulatory incentive 
to build new power plants. It is a win for 
our customers, a win for the company and 
a win for the environment.

pOTENTIAL SAVINGS

We are adding about 60,000 new 
customers per year in the Carolinas and 
our Midwest service areas. To meet that 
demand, we will require more than 6,000 
megawatts of new capacity by 2012.  
Energy efficiency as our fifth fuel and the 
save-a-watt model are critical components 
to avoid building new, carbon-emitting 
generation.  

REGULATORy STATUS

In 2007, we filed for regulatory approval of 
programs developed under the save-a-watt 
model in North Carolina, South Carolina, 
and Indiana. We are planning to file for 
similar energy efficiency programs in Ohio 
and kentucky in 2008. We hope to receive 
regulatory approval for the save-a-watt 
model in 2008.

  The Clinton Global Initiative – In 

2007, Duke Energy led a consortium 
of eight utilities committing to increase 
investments in energy efficiency to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
pending the approval of the save-a- 
watt model or similar regulatory action. 
Offered in conjunction with the Clinton 
Global Initiative, the utilities also  
spearheaded the creation of the 
Institute of Electric Efficiency to  
advance best practices in energy 
efficiency. The Edison Electric  
Institute is implementing the Institute  
of Electric Efficiency in 2008.  
http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org

keeping electric  
rates competitive

Electric rates and reliability remain the 
primary drivers of customer satisfac-
tion. In 2007, our costs of service were 
below the national average and near or 
below statewide averages. However, the 
cost to produce energy is rising, and we 
are not immune to rising market prices.  
Worldwide demand for steel, cement, 
skilled labor and all other inputs to power 
plant construction, operation and mainte-
nance have already forced us to raise cost 
estimates for major construction projects.  
We are working to stabilize prices and 
minimize impacts on customers through 
long-term contracts and other commit-
ments with contractors and vendors.

Source: EEI Typical Bills and Average Rates Report, June 30, 2007

In kentucky, we received permission 

from the Public Service Commission 
to raise annual revenues by approxi-
mately 20 percent, effective January 1, 
2007. This was the first rate increase 
for kentucky customers in 16 years. In 
Ohio, we received permission from the 
Public Utilities Commission to increase 
our revenues by over 10 percent through 
periodic riders. We will continue efforts 
there to address long-term rate and genera-
tion supply uncertainties.   

It is occasionally appropriate to reduce 

rates and still be fiducially responsible to 
investors. In North Carolina, we reached 
an agreement to reduce annual revenues 
by 5.4 percent beginning in 2008 and by 
7.6 percent beginning in 2009. The reduc-
tion in rate revenue is offset by a reduction 
in expenses resulting in an immaterial 
impact to earnings.

There were no specific rate actions in 
Indiana or South Carolina in 2007 other 
than the annual adjustments for items like 
fuel costs.

 
 
 
Providing customers  
with green power options

Duke Energy offers its customers special 
programs to purchase energy generated 
from renewable sources such as wind, 
solar, biomass and hydro.

NC GREENpOWER 

Duke Energy participates in the NC 
GreenPower program, which was estab-
lished to improve the state’s environment 
through voluntary contributions toward 
renewable energy. Approximately 7,200 
Duke Energy customers in North Carolina – 
less than 1 percent – participated in  
NC GreenPower in 2007, purchasing 
nearly 12,000 blocks of 100-kilowatt-
hours each for an investment of over 
$45,000.

In February 2008, Duke Energy  
filed its intent with the N.C. Utilities 
Commission to expand the existing 
GreenPower program to offer customers 
the opportunity to purchase carbon offsets. 
Funds collected through the program, 
if approved, could be used to support 
carbon-reducing projects such as renew-
able energy, energy efficiency and refores-
tation. We plan to pursue similar programs 
in all the states where we operate.

pALmETTO CLEAN ENERGy (paCE)

South Carolina customers can now 
contribute to PaCE, a nonprofit 
organization that promotes renew-
able resources for electric generation, 
through their Duke Energy bills. Each 
$4, whether by voluntary regular 
monthly additions to the bill or one- 
time contributions, will add a 100- 
kilowatt-hour block of renewable  
energy to the S.C. power supply.

GOGREEN pOWER 

Duke Energy customers in Ohio and 
Indiana may also purchase blocks  
of green power on a monthly basis.  
We are working to establish a program  
for kentucky customers in 2008.

Duke Energy customers in Ohio were  
the first to participate in a one-of-a-kind 
collaboration between Duke Energy, 
General Electric and Wal-Mart to make 
energy efficiency even more affordable.  
We provided our customers with coupons 
offering $3 off three-packs of GE compact

at Wal-Mart stores. Some 30,000 
customers redeemed coupons to buy  
more than 225,000 CFls during the

we have expanded our retail partnerships 
to include Sam’s Club, The Home Depot 
and lowe’s.

OUr CUSTOMEr SATISFACTION PlEDGE: 

We will do it right the first time. We will take ownership.  

We will follow through.

Customer satisfaction 

We have work to do to achieve our goal 
of top quartile customer satisfaction in 
all markets we serve by 2012. Among 
business customers that spend between 
$500 and $50,000 monthly on electric-
ity, we ranked in the second quartile in 
the South and the third quartile in the 
Midwest, according to the Feb. 2008 
J.D. Power and Associates Electric Utility 
Business Customer Satisfaction Study. 

The key Accounts National Benchmark 

survey, conducted by TQS research Inc., 
is based on interviews with each utility 
company’s largest customers, which are 
usually major manufacturers and institu-
tions. Duke Energy ranked fifth best 
overall in the U.S. in the August 2007 
study. While the survey is based on the 
entire company, the results indicate that 
Duke Energy Carolinas would have ranked 
second in the South. Duke Energy Ohio/
kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana would 
have ranked second and third, respectively, 
in the Midwest.

residential customer satisfaction results 

were mixed in 2007. In the July 2007 
J.D. Power and Associates Electric Utility 
residential Customer Satisfaction Study, 
Duke Energy ranked in the top quartile 
in the South and the third quartile in the 
Midwest. 

We have several major initiatives to 

improve customer satisfaction.  

Improve service reliability for our 
customers: We plan to significantly 
increase our investments to modernize 
poorly performing distribution circuits.  
And, we plan to improve outage-related 
customer communications.

  Partner with customers to lower and 
manage their bills: From innovative 
partnerships with retailers, to expanding 
our energy saving product offerings, to 
new ways to engage customers, we are 
aggressively pursuing energy efficiency 
options to meet future growth and to 
increase the energy value delivered to 
our customers.

  Broaden our internal “I Can Help” 
program: Every employee now has 
access to telephone or e-mail resources 
to make sure he or she can 
quickly and satisfacto-
rily address customer 
questions and needs.

ENERGY AUDIT MAKES  
OPRAH WINFREY SHOW
Duke Energy’s Home Energy House 
Call program was featured on the  
Oprah Winfrey Show’s 2007 Earth Day 
special. The program provides a free 
in-home energy analysis to help 
customers determine the most cost-
effective steps they can take in their 
homes to save energy. The TV episode, 
highlighting viewers who are living a 
“green lifestyle,” featured a House Call 
field auditor helping a Northern 
kentucky couple identify the steps they 
could take to reduce energy consump-
tion. The audience members were given 
energy saving kits during the show.

WEATHERIzATION FOR  
LOW-INCOME CUSTOMERS
For more than 20 years, Duke Energy 
has collaborated with People Working 
Cooperatively (PWC) to provide free 
home weatherization improvements  
to eligible customers in the Greater 
Cincinnati and Northern kentucky 
areas. PWC is a nonprofit organization 
that provides critical home repairs and 
services to low-income, elderly and 
disabled homeowners. Through our 
program, qualified customers receive  
a furnace or heat pump cleaning and 
tune-up, energy efficient light bulbs,  
a water heater wrap and weather  
stripping. The result is a more comfort-
able, energy efficient home with lower 
energy bills.

Power reliability improved

Continued attention to power reliability in 2007 resulted in real improvement, with fewer 
outages per customer and shorter outages when they did occur. These results place us 
in the top quartile among peer electric utilities when compared to 2006, the most recent 
data available from the Southeastern Electric Exchange.

Smarter utility services

We’ve made good progress on the utility of 
the future strategy since we introduced the 
concept in last year’s Sustainability report.  
We expect to invest almost $1 billion 

through 2012 to transform our energy 
delivery system for the needs of the 21st 
century. Advanced digital technology will 
replace analog technology, enabling near-
instantaneous communication between our 
customers and our distribution system. For 
example, we believe it will be possible to 
program refrigerators, freezers, and other 
high-use electrical appliances to reduce 
operations when demand on our generat-
ing stations is especially high. Customers 
will be able to adjust heating and air 
conditioning for high comfort at lower cost. 
real-time electric meters may show the 
cost of operating devices just as speedome-
ters show actual speed. This capability will 
be far more useful for energy management 
purposes than the monthly “look back” that 
current systems provide. When the smarter 
technology is fully implemented, every 
customer will have access to advanced 
energy efficiency measures that will run in 
the background of their home or business.

In addition to smart customer meters, 
smart grids – substations, transformers and 
line sensors – will operate and commu-
nicate together much like a computer 
network. Abrupt changes in electric flow, 
as monitored through the smart grid, 
will alert us to the approximate location 
of outages more quickly than present 
systems, allowing faster service restoration.  
We filed information to support these 
system upgrades with the Public Utilities 
Commission of Ohio in 2007, and are 
planning to file in the other states we serve 
in 2008. We also joined the Gridwise 
Alliance to work with like-minded compa-
nies involved in this complex transforma-
tion of the nationwide electric system.

In 2007, we began projects in N.C. 
and S.C. to test different components of  
the smart grid technology. We are also 
opening public demonstration sites in 
N.C., S.C. and ky. to provide a “hands-on” 
experience with the new technologies. 
More information will be available at  
www.duke-energy.com.

GRIDWISE
A Collaborative Venture of the U.S. 
Department of Energy and the 
GridWise Alliance. Duke Energy is  
a member of this consortium of 
public and private stakeholders who  
are aligned around a shared vision 
of an integrated electric system. 
Ideally, energy can be generated, 
distributed and consumed more  
efficiently and cost effectively to 
achieve a more resilient, secure and 
reliable system. www.gridwise.org

LED LIGHTING THE F UTURE
In October 2007, Duke Energy teamed 
with Cree Inc. and launched a project 
to evaluate the use of light-emitting 
diodes (lED) for widespread commer-
cial purposes. Cree has installed  
19 outdoor lED lights at the company’s 
Durham, N.C., office to replace  
standard high-pressure sodium light 
fixtures. The project will provide data  
to evaluate the technology’s energy  
efficiency and longevity. It also may 
demonstrate that lEDs are viable alter-
natives to existing commercial lighting.

Duke Energy’s greatest sustainability risks and opportunities are in this 
environmental focus area. In 2007, we developed additional goals to  
reduce our air, water, and waste footprints; they can be found on page 11.

POlICy PrIOrITIES:

We are working with stakeholders to promote a climate change policy 

that will result in long-term greenhouse gas reductions that most 

climate scientists think are necessary. An acceptable policy must 

also protect customers in states that depend on coal-fired generation. 

Twenty-five states receive more than half of their electric power 

from coal-fired sources. They must not bear an unfair share of the 

economic burden of the transition to a low-carbon economy.

responding to global 
climate change

In last year’s report, we shared our view 
on global climate change policy. In 2007, 
we continued to advance policy priori-
ties designed to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions while minimizing economic  
and social disruption to our customers  
and economies.

REDUCING GREENhOUSE  
GAS EmISSIONS       

Duke Energy is the third largest emitter 

of carbon dioxide in the U.S. While we 
don’t know the specific timing or require-
ments of federal carbon legislation, we do 
know that it is coming. And, we know that 
the decisions we make today about energy 
production and use can help build bridges 
to a low-carbon future.

As discussed earlier in this report,  
we are evaluating what it would take to  
cut our 2006 CO2 emissions in half – by 
approximately 50 million tons – by 2030. 
Clearly, many things can happen between 
now and 2030, and a number of things 
must happen if we’re going to be able to 
achieve this level of emission reduction 
while meeting projected demand and 
keeping electric rates competitive.

“Edwardsport Station could be one of the first demonstrations of  

carbon capture and storage at a power plant. This project is  

technologically important not just for Indiana, but for the nation.”  

 – Duke Energy Indiana President Jim Stanley

Building bridges with technology

We are working to reduce our greenhouse 
gas emissions with new technologies on 
both the supply and demand sides. The 
previous section reviewed some of our 
initiatives to reduce energy demand. On 
the supply side, we’re looking at a number 
of different technologies – some proven, 
others emerging.

  We are building a cleaner-coal 

integrated gasification combined cycle 
(IGCC) plant – a plant that will replace 
a half century-old coal plant. The 
630-megawatt (MW) plant is being 
built in Edwardsport, Ind., where the 
limestone geology is believed to be 
conducive to geologic sequestration  
of carbon. Sequestration involves 
securely storing CO2 in deep under-
ground formations such as saline 
reservoirs, depleted oil or gas fields,  
or unmineable coal seams.

  Duke Energy is also participating in 

three of the seven U.S. Department of 
Energy projects to test CO2 capture and 
storage. These partnerships form the 
core of a nationwide effort to assess 
the technical and economic viability of 
capturing and permanently storing CO2 
through carbon sequestration.

In the Carolinas, we’re building an 
advanced, highly efficient 800-MW 
coal plant – Unit 6 – at the Cliffside 
Steam Station. Cliffside 6 is expected 

to generate over twice the electricity of 
the existing five units, while emitting 
one-seventh of the sulfur dioxide, 
one-third of the nitrogen oxides and 
one-half of the mercury. Additionally, 
we have developed with N.C. regulators 
a plan to retire approximately 1,000 
MW of older, less efficient coal-fired 
plants and take additional actions to 
make Cliffside 6 “carbon neutral” by 
2018. We’re not building an IGCC  
plant in North Carolina because the 
geology is not suitable for carbon 
sequestration. Cliffside 6 will likely  
be the last new coal plant we build  
in North Carolina for at least 20 years. 
By then, we expect carbon capture 
technology to advance so it can be  
used on virtually any coal plant,  
regardless of the geology.

  Also in North Carolina, we’re planning 

to build more than 1,200 MW of 
natural gas-fired generation capacity to 
meet increasing demand. These lower-
emitting natural gas units will also help 
us fill the need for electricity as we 
retire older coal units.

  We’re using our more than three 

decades of experience in building and 
operating nuclear plants to plan a new, 
2,234-MW nuclear power plant in 
South Carolina – a plant that will have 
zero greenhouse gas emissions.

WILDLIFE AND  
INDUSTRY TOGETHER
Duke Energy’s riverbend Steam Station 
has seen its wildlife population thrive in 
recent years. The station is among 
several Duke Energy properties that 
have been certified as part of the North 
Carolina Wildlife Federation’s Wildlife 
and Industry Together (WAIT) program.  
WAIT pairs companies with volunteers 
and community groups to develop 
company land into natural habitat. As 
part of riverbend’s five-year WAIT plan, 
Boy Scout troops from the surrounding 
Belmont, N.C. area are partnering with 
the station to complete 14 environ-
mental projects, including erecting 
nature-trail bridges, bird houses and a 
wildlife feed plot that is ideal for deer, 
turkey and other animals.

22

Investing in renewables

Duke Energy launched several initiatives  
to bolster its renewable energy portfolio  
in 2007. 

In May, we acquired the wind power 
assets of Tierra Energy, a leading 
development company located in 
Austin, Texas. The purchase included 
more than 1,000 MW of wind assets 
under development in the western and 
southwestern U.S. Duke Energy plans 
to spend approximately $430 million in 
2008 to complete the first three wind 
development projects acquired from 
Tierra. We recently made purchase 
commitments for 155 wind turbines, 
with a total capacity of 240 MW, to 
support this effort into 2010.

  We issued a request for proposals  

(rFP) for up to 2,100 MW of renew-
able energy in the Carolinas in April 
2007. Many bids were received, and 
the evaluations are underway.

  Duke Energy Indiana also issued an 
rFP in October 2007 for up to 200 
MW of renewable energy. Those bids 
are due in early 2008 and will take 
several months to evaluate. This is in 
addition to the 100 MW of wind power 
that Duke Energy Indiana will begin 
purchasing in 2008 based on agree-
ments that were finalized in 2006.

  Duke Energy Carolinas completed 

successful tests of biomass co-firing in 
2007 and assessed the availability of 
commercial quantities of biomass near 
our fossil stations.

From its roots in 1904 as a hydroelectric 
station operator along the Catawba river, 
Duke Energy is today the second largest 
investor-owned hydroelectric operator in 
the U.S. And, we have more than 3,100 
MW of hydroelectric capacity in South 
America.

 
Power plant options

With about 60,000 new Duke Energy customers each year, it will take time for the benefits of energy efficiency to significantly  
curb demand. We use four criteria to evaluate energy supply options: Is the supply affordable? Is it available? Is it reliable? Is it  
clean? This table summarizes the current state of power plant technology and economics for our service areas.

GREENhOUSE GAS REDUCTION  
FUND – EFFICIENCy BEGINS AT hOmE

GREENhOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS  
IN GAS OpERATIONS

Duke Energy promotes energy efficiency 
as an essential part of the solution for 
curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. 
To emphasize our commitment, we 
established a Greenhouse Gas reduction 
Fund to stimulate innovation and energy 
efficiency within our own operations.
The fund’s goal is to help reduce, 
avoid or sequester 10 million tons in CO2 
equivalents (CO2e)* by 2015. In 2007, we 
awarded $3 million to fund 46 efficiency 
projects at generating stations and office 
facilities, as well as renewable energy 
projects. Those projects resulted in the 
avoidance of approximately 300,000 tons 
of CO2e in 2007. Many of the projects  
will accrue additional tons avoided in 
2008 and beyond.  

In 2008, another $3 million has 
been allocated to fund 36 projects that 
will enhance efficiency and reduce the 
company’s carbon footprint. 

Duke Energy provides natural gas and 
electric service in the Greater Cincinnati 
region. For many years, we have 
purchased landfill gas that has been 
extracted from the rumpke landfill and 
processed. In 2007, the largest “landfill 
gas to pipeline” plant in the world was 
completed by GSF Energy llC. The new 
plant significantly increases the productive 
capabilities at the landfill. Duke Energy  
will buy all of the landfill gas from this 
project, equivalent to the needs of about 
17,500 homes.

Capture and sale of landfill gas, which 

is about half methane and half carbon 
dioxide, not only supplements gas supplies 
from traditional pipelines for Duke Energy 
customers; it also prevents a significant 
amount of greenhouse gas from being 
released to the atmosphere. The methane 
is piped to our customers and the captured 
CO2 is sold to other businesses.

* CO2 equivalent: CO2e is a measure of the global warming potential over a period of time (typically 100 
years) for different gases. CO2 is given a reference value of 1 and all other gases are multiples of CO2. 
For example, one ton of methane has the global warming potential of 23 tons of CO2.

CHILDREN’S PROjECT GOES WILD
In 2007, approximately 2,000 students 
from rowan-Salisbury Schools in 
rowan County, N.C. participated in  
the outdoor classroom at Duke Energy’s 
Buck Steam Station. This environmental 
education experience is part of Project 
WIlD, a joint effort between Duke 
Energy, the North Carolina Wildlife 
resources Commission, Horizons 
Unlimited of rowan-Salisbury Schools 
and Ducks Unlimited. The program 
provides opportunities for fifth-graders 
to see and learn about wetlands, 
meadows, birds and animals in their 
natural settings.

GETTING OUR OWN “HOUSE”  
IN ORDER: ENERGY EFFICIENCY  
AT DUKE ENERGY OFFICES    
We are improving energy efficiency  
in the office space we own or lease 
across our five-state service area. 
lighting upgrades undertaken in 2007 
and planned for 2008 are expected to 
save approximately 1.5 gigawatt-hours 
of electricity per year, which is equiva-
lent to the total energy needs of about 
125 homes.

the Catawba-Wateree river Basin have 
coordinated their actions to reduce water 
consumption. The resulting savings have 
kept all large water intakes covered and 
operating. We also worked with public 
water systems that withdraw water from 
our other hydro reservoirs to encourage 
aggressive water conservation measures.

COORDINATED ACTION

To improve long-term management of 
water resources in our region, Duke Energy 
and 15 public water system owners formed 
a nonprofit corporation called the Catawba-
Wateree Water Management Group 
(WMG). Supported by member dues and 
other funding, the WMG will take actions 
to enhance water quantity and quality in 
the Catawba-Wateree river Basin, such as:   

  Establishing a groundwater monitoring 
network to improve the understanding 
of how groundwater affects surface 
water availability during droughts 

  Modifying existing water intakes to 
allow operation at lower lake levels 

  Optimizing water intake and return 

during April-December compared to the 
average for the same months during the 
previous four years.  

We also established an in-house 
Drought Mitigation Team to monitor and 
forecast drought effects on lake system 
storage throughout Duke Energy Carolinas’ 
service area and to make plans if the 
drought continues through the summer 
of 2008. As a result, several equipment 
and procedural modifications are either 
under way or being planned at nuclear and 
fossil stations to reduce drought-related 
risks. We also purchased an option for 
additional generating capacity that can 
be used during 2008, as another step to 
help ensure that the energy needs of our 
customers are met.

REGIONAL WATER SUppLIES

locations 

Many of the company’s reservoirs in the 
Carolinas also provide raw water to public 
water systems and industrial process 
water. As part of our Comprehensive 
relicensing Agreement for the Catawba-
Wateree Hydroelectric Project, we joined 
with 24 public water systems, several 
large industrial plants and state and federal 
agencies to form a Drought Management 
Advisory Group. This group designed and 
implemented a regional drought response 
plan. For the first time, Duke Energy and 
the other water intake owners across

Duke Energy owns and manages 13 hydro-
power stations and 11 reservoirs on the 
Catawba-Wateree river system, covering 
over 200 river-miles in North Carolina and 
South Carolina. The river and reservoirs 
are the backbone of our generation fleet, 
providing over 830 megawatts of renew-
able hydropower and cooling water to  
more than 8,100 megawatts of fossil  
and nuclear generation, approximately  
45 percent of Duke Energy Carolinas’ 
generating capacity.

ELECTRIC GENERATION

In 2007, North Carolina experienced the 
driest year and South Carolina experienced 
the fifth driest year in the 113 years that 
rainfall records have been maintained. In 
total, the Duke Energy Carolinas service 
area received less than 28 inches of 
rainfall in 2007, or 40 percent below the 
long-term average. Despite the drought and 
record-high temperatures, Duke Energy 
Carolinas’ employees kept our power plants 
operating and managed lake levels to keep 
municipal and industrial water intakes 
covered. When drought conditions intensi-
fied during April, we began to reduce our 
use of hydroelectric generation throughout 
the Duke Energy Carolinas service area 
to preserve water in the reservoirs. This 
resulted in a systemwide reduction in 
hydroelectric generation of 67 percent

Investing in research and development            

Duke Energy directs much of its research effort toward projects coordinated by the Electric Power research Institute (EPrI). In 2007,  
we invested $8.4 million in EPrI membership dues to pay for applied research and another $2.1 million in supplemental projects.  
Duke Energy participates in 47 non-nuclear programs and the entire EPrI nuclear program.

CERTIFIED PAPER HELPS 
CONSERVATION EFFORTS.

Duke Energy is reaffirming its 
commitment to preserve natural 
resources by increasing its use  

of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-
certified paper. In 2007, Duke Energy 
developed guidelines to establish the  
use of FSC-certified papers across the 
company and make FSC certification 
mandatory for contract printers. Beginning 
in 2008, FSC-certified paper will be  
used for printed materials that carry  
the Duke Energy logo.

EPEAT COMPUTERS REDUCE 
HAzARDOUS WASTE
Duke Energy transitioned to fully  
EPEAT-registered (Electronic Product 
Environmental Assessment Tool) computer 
workstations and monitors in 2007.  
These business-class machines have 
reduced levels of cadmium, lead and 
mercury to better protect human  
health and the environment during  
manufacture and disposal. To achieve 
EPEAT registration, equipment must  
also comply with Energy Star, a program  
of the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency and Department of Energy.

NUCLEAR FLEET EXCELS 
The Duke Energy-operated seven-unit 
nuclear fleet (McGuire Station shown 
above) set an all-time operating record in 
September 2007. All seven generating units 
operated continuously for 107 days, 
surpassing the previous record of 89 days. 
Additionally, three nuclear units set electric 
production records in 2007. The company 

maintains its nuclear units around-the-
clock by following a rigorous protocol to 
identify and repair problems before they 
impact operations. The nuclear fleet played 
an important role in the company’s ability 
to respond to the summer-long heat wave 
in the Carolinas, which resulted in record-
breaking customer demand.

REEL-LESS WIRE DELIVERIES

Duke Energy 
works with its 
suppliers to 
reduce environ-
mental impacts 
in unlikely 
places. Wire 

and cable were traditionally delivered on 
large, heavy wooden reels (shown in  
background) that were returned to the 

manufacturer, but had limited life-spans. 
We teamed up with Southwire, one of our 
major suppliers, to develop a delivery 
method that does not require reels. Now, 
we place the reel-less wire bundles on

Quality Workforce

OUr SAFETy VISION: 

Duke Energy employees and contractors at every level demonstrate 

personal commitment to continuous safety improvement, resulting  

in a zero injury and zero work-related illness culture.

2007 CHALLENGES

Improve employee and  
contractor safety

  Compete with other companies  
and industries for the best talent

2007 OPPORTUNITIES

  Become the leader in  
safe work practices

  maintain reputation as a preferred 
employer and attract top talent

Safety update

We measure safety performance  
through two measures:  

  Zero fatalities

  Total Incident Case rate (TICr) –  

the number of recordable incidents  
per 100 employees (based on 
Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration criteria)

We failed to reach our goal of zero 
fatalities in 2007. We are saddened to 
report the accidental deaths of two Duke 
Energy employees. A Gas Operations 
employee was fatally injured by an 
automobile while working on a natural gas 
line in Ohio. Another teammate was killed 
while preparing to tow a vehicle in Peru. 
These tragedies remind us that we work 
in a hazardous environment and must be 
extra vigilant to the safety risks around us.

WHAT WE DID IN 2007

Improved total incident  
case rate by 17 percent

  Did not meet goal of zero fatalities

  Developed a workforce needs  
forecast and revitalized our  
recruiting efforts

  established additional partnerships 
and collaborations with educational 
institutions to prepare future workers

WHAT WE DID IN 2007

  focused on safety culture, training 

and process improvements

  Benchmarked leading companies  

to ensure competitive compensation 
and benefits

We completed 2007 with a TICr 
of 1.25, a 17 percent improvement 
over 2006. This translates to 65 fewer 
employees being injured in 2007. We also 
saw a 26 percent improvement in our lost 
workday case rate (lWCr) from 2006 to 
2007, and those employees who missed 
work due to injuries returned sooner.  
TICr and lWCr were both better than  
our 2007 targets.

Our goal is to achieve top decile TICr 
performance by 2012. While we improved 
in 2007, we still lag the leaders in our 
industry. Among the largest investor-owned 
electric utilities, those in the top decile 
for safety performance in 2006 (the most 
recent data available from the Edison 
Electric Institute (EEI)) had a TICr of  
0.76 or lower.

CONTRACTOR SAFETy 

The Duke Energy Foundation sponsored 
the National Contractor Safety Summit in 
2006. As a result of their involvement in 
the Summit, in 2007, the U.S. National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health, the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration and the Bureau of labor 
Statistics established a national working 
group to improve the collection of contrac-
tor safety statistics. We are also directly 
involved in various research projects to 
improve contractor safety. The results will 
be available to interested parties. And, 
through Duke Energy leadership, the EEI 
executive committee adopted Health and 
Safety Principles, a first for EEI.

Internally, we have improved our 

contractor safety data collection methods.  
Safety Summits were held in the Carolinas 
and Midwest to communicate our safety 
values and expectations to senior manag-
ers and project managers of contracting 
companies.

ERGONOmICS

Several business units have focused  
on reducing injuries due to poor workplace 
design or practices. Injuries to Power 
Delivery line technicians dropped by 25 
percent in 2007 as a result of ergonomic 
safety improvements. Fleet Services and 
Nuclear Operations have implemented 
specific programs to identify risks and 
improve ergonomic safety.

recruiting, developing and retaining employees

Duke Energy is facing major change not 
only in its business environment, but 
within the company as well. We see dual 
challenges ahead: 

  Competing for the best talent: hiring 
replacements for the approximately 
one-third of our employees who may 
retire in the next five years.

  Preserving specialized knowledge:  
systematically capturing the critical 
knowledge of our employees before  
they retire. 

Duke Energy has a number of  
efforts designed to attract, retain and 
develop employees: 

  We are identifying the core skills and 
jobs that we will staff internally, and 
those that we will contract with others 
to provide.  

  We have developed knowledge  
management and aging worker  
retention strategies, including support 
for federal pension reform so retirement-
eligible workers can work part-time  
and draw from a retirement plan 
without penalty. 

  We have revamped our training and 

development, including a new Strategic 
leadership Program developed in 
conjunction with the University of  
North Carolina’s kenan-Flagler School 

of Business. 

  We are developing and testing a 
software tool to help employees 
find courses and other training 
opportunities. 

  We implemented a new software 

tool for performance management, 
employee development planning  
and succession planning.

  We are using rotational programs 
to attract and develop early career 
professionals.

  We are working in partnership with 
community colleges and technical 
schools on development and recruiting 
for technician positions.  

  We are expanding internship and co-op 
programs in nuclear, engineering and 
technical services, power delivery and 
the commercial businesses.

  We are expanding opportunities for 

employee networking and collaboration 
through Employee resource Groups, 
safety steering teams and project 
teams.

  We regularly benchmark leading 
companies to offer competitive  
compensation and benefits, and 
progressive workplace programs.

  We conduct periodic employee opinion 
surveys to assess and improve our 
culture and workplace practices.

Employee career development opportunities

Once hired, employees are encouraged to continue their education through in-company 
courses or outside classes. For some positions, especially in the craft and technician 
roles, employees must complete specific training modules to retain their jobs. In 2007, 
we implemented a new online tool to register for classes and track training records. 
Through this system, we recorded more than 17,400 employees taking nearly 500,000 
hours of in-house training.

While there’s tremendous power in a shared culture and sense of 

purpose, we recognize and value the diversity of our employees.

Building a culture of sustainability and diversity

We believe that driving the concepts of 
sustainability throughout Duke Energy – 
making it “part of our DNA” – will create 
long-term value and differentiation. In 
2008, we will be undertaking a compre-
hensive training and education effort 
to build a corporate culture of sustain-
ability. We expect it to lead to innovative 
approaches to our business issues and to 
align our employees around the principles 
of sustainability.

While there’s tremendous power in a 
shared culture and sense of purpose, we 
recognize and value the diversity of our 
employees. Our diversity efforts include: 

  A Diversity Council, comprised of 

a cross section of company officers 
and employees, provides oversight of 
diversity and inclusion efforts, includ-
ing company policies, programs and 
initiatives. Diversity Steering Teams are 
used to improve diversity awareness 
and help create an inclusive culture.

Employee turnover

  Employee resource Groups: The 
company supports a number of 
employee groups to bring together 
colleagues of similar interests and 
backgrounds. regardless of the name, 
each group is open to any employee. 
The groups provide educational, 
networking, professional development 
and community service opportunities, 
and include the following:  

  African-American Network

  Business Women’s Network

  latino Network (Under 

development)

  leadership Development Network 

The company also supports  

employee participation in local chapters 
of national groups such as the American 
Association of Blacks in Energy, North 
American young Generation in Nuclear  
and Women in Nuclear.

The average Duke Energy employee is about 48 years old with 20 years of service to  
the company. Employee turnover in 2007 was about 6 percent. Nearly 85 percent of  
the employees who left the company did so voluntarily. Employees affected by restructur-
ing were offered help in finding new positions, either within Duke Energy or outside the 
company through career assistance. We also offered voluntary severance packages to 
encourage reductions in specific business areas.

Employee wellness 

2007 James B. Duke award recipients

In 2007, Duke Energy expanded its Live 
Well program to all U.S.-based employees. 
The program is designed to improve health 
and wellness and reduce health care 
costs through educational programs and 
incentives for healthy living. Employees 
are encouraged to set up a personal profile 
and participate in an online assessment. 
The system also allows employees to track 
their participation and progress, including 
generating “credits,” redeemable for an 
incentive of up to $200 into their Health 
Care Spending Accounts.

@Work pilot a success

In 2007, Duke Energy expanded its 
telecommuting pilot to a more formal-
ized program called “@Work,” in which 
participants worked from home an average 
of three or more days a week. Future 
participants will use shared workspace 
when they are in the office. Because the 
pilot resulted in stable productivity and 
enhanced employee satisfaction, @Work 
is being expanded in 2008. Over the 
long-term, we expect to see lower facility 
costs and reduced carbon emissions also 
resulting from this program. 

32

Each year, 
Duke Energy 
presents its 

highest employee honor – the James B. 
Duke Award – to employees who exemplify 
our values and goals. The award is named 
for noted industrialist and visionary “Buck” 
Duke, who was one of the company’s 
founders more than a century ago. Winners 
of the James B. Duke award are nominated 
and selected by their peers.  

The accomplishments of our Duke 
Award winners touch on many aspects of 
sustainability. These outstanding employ-
ees are advocates, ambassadors, innova-
tors, inventors and yes, even heroes. 

  Norman Barnes, Service Mechanic A, 
Cincinnati – saved the lives of three 
people when he continued to search  
for tenants of an apartment building 
that had been evacuated following a 
gas leak. 

  Peter Hastings, Licensing Manager, 

Nuclear Plant Development, Charlotte 
– led the effort to complete the 
8,000-page construction and operating 
license application for two new nuclear 
units in South Carolina. The applica-
tion was submitted to the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission in December 
2007 after more than two years of 
preparation. (See pages 6 and 21.)

  Kelley Karn, Associate General Counsel, 

Plainfield – oversaw the regulatory 
approval process of the Edwardsport 
integrated gasification combined cycle 
(IGCC) plant. Edwardsport is the first 
major power plant to be built in Indiana 
in more than 20 years. (See pages  
5 and 21.)

  Marilyn Lineberger, Communications 

Manager II, Charlotte and  
Sandy Tallant, Business Relations 

Executive, Hendersonville, N.C. –  
led the communications, community 
relations and stakeholder engagement 
supporting the Cliffside Modernization 
Project.  Construction of the plant is 
now under way. (See pages 6 and 21.)

  Dr. Larry McKenzie, Nuclear Station 
Instructor, Catawba Nuclear Station, 
S.C. – spearheaded a radiation protec-
tion technology program at Spartanburg 
Community College – the first of its kind 
in the nation. This program fills  
a company need for technical skills  
and provides job opportunities for  
the community.

  Harry Poovey, Economic Development 
Manager, Hickory, N.C. – served as 
the company’s primary point of contact 
to attract the Google facility to North 
Carolina. (See page 34.)

  Dee Putnam, Senior Health and  

Safety Specialist, Charlotte – helped 
implement a new safety device that 
resulted in 100 percent fall protection 
for employees who climb wooden  
poles in their work. 

  Rob Smith, Meter Reader, Cincinnati – 
was the first responder to an accident 
he encountered on a highway. By 
applying CPR skills he learned on  
the job, he saved the driver’s life. 

  Ron Thompson, Planner, Work 
Management, Zimmer Station, 
Ohio and Phil Williamson, Station 
Equipment Expert, Miami Fort Station, 
Ohio – are teaching important lessons 
of respect and tolerance to a new 
generation of students. They share  
the tragic history of the Transatlantic 
Slave Trade with students at Three 
Rivers Middle School and elsewhere  
to ensure these lessons of history are 
not forgotten.

Employee opinion survey

2007 was a year of great change within 
Duke Energy. Our natural gas pipeline 
business was spun off in January. There 
were also many changes to familiar 
systems and programs as we consolidated 
the company. As we do each year,  
employees were given an opportunity to 
complete an opinion survey. In 2007, 65 
percent of our employee population replied.

Headlines from the survey: 

  Supervisor-employee relationships:  
This aspect of work life received high 
marks in many areas. The overall 
“supervisory skills” category received  
a 72 percent positive rating.

  Response: Although we are doing 

well, we are determined to do better. 
A variety of training programs are 
available, and will be required for new 
supervisors, to further develop the skills 
needed to lead employees effectively.

  Company strategy and leadership:  

Slightly less than half of the employees 
who responded to the survey felt they 
understood the company’s strategy.

  Response: In 2008, the company’s 
updated mission, values and direc-
tion are being broadly communicated.   
Additionally, executive management 
members host monthly “Open Forums” 
and other employee discussions at 
various locations throughout our service 
areas. We are experimenting with other 
communications, such as internal  
blogs, to address employee questions 
and comments.  

  Workload and resources: Employees 
felt their workload was increasing due 
to cost and workforce reductions.  

  Response: To improve efficiency, we 
are identifying unnecessary work to 
help eliminate the “we’ve always done 
it that way” problem. We are also 
hiring additional people in selected 
areas and targeting specific work that 
can be completed more effectively by 
contractors. 

  Productivity: Sixty-six percent said they 
had the right knowledge and skills to 
be productive at work, which is a slight 
improvement since the previous year’s 
survey.   

  Response: We seem to be on the right 
track, but again, there is room for 
improvement. We have an increased 
commitment to employee training 
and development through online and 
hard-copy resources, as well as classes, 
seminars, and craft and technical train-
ing opportunities.   

  Rewards: Many employees felt they 
were not rewarded for good work. 

  Response: Since the survey was taken, 
job titles and pay structures have been 
standardized across the company. Most 
jobs have been matched to external 
market surveys. And, new performance 
management processes are in place  
for 2008.

Although the positive responses were 

not as high as we would have liked in 
many areas, the negative ratings were 
generally in the single-digit or low-teen 
percentages. responses that were neutral 
made up a large middle segment, which 
may be expected as employees become 
accustomed to the new company.

Economic development 
exceeds expectations 

Duke Energy’s success is directly linked 
to the communities we serve. We partner 
with economic development specialists in 
our five-state service territory to help attract 
new business and industry. Energy prices 
and reliability – coupled with the overall 
quality of life – are important criteria when 
businesses determine where to locate.
In 2007, Duke Energy’s economic 
development specialists worked with state 
and regional government officials to help 
attract approximately $3.7 billion in capital 
investments and 15,270 new jobs to the 
five states we serve. That exceeded our 
goals of 12,500 new jobs and $2.4 billion 
in investment.

While our representatives in each state 

were involved in dozens of successful 
projects, a few stand out:

  Google – Internet search leader Google 
is building a data storage center in 
Caldwell County, N.C. The company 
plans to invest up to $600 million on 
its new facility and create 210 new and 
relatively well-paying jobs in the next 
four years.

34

  Honda jet – This subsidiary of Honda 
Motors announced plans to locate 
its world headquarters and airframe 
assembly plant at Piedmont Triad 
International Airport in N.C. Honda will 
invest up to $100 million and create 
more than 280 jobs with average 
wages of more than $70,000 per year. 
The plant will produce the company’s 
eight-person, twin engine private jet.

  Cummins Engine – It is often better to 
re-use existing structures than to build 
new ones. Cummins Inc. will invest 
$250 million and create more than 
600 new jobs to produce a new light-

Ind., plant. The building is a former 
heavy-duty engine assembly plant that 
closed in 2002.

  Amylin Pharmaceuticals – This biotech 
firm demonstrates the popularity of 
southern Ohio for specialized manufac-
turing.  Amylin is expanding a facility 
that was already under construction 
into a $400 million project. About 

500 new jobs will be created in Butler 
County, Ohio, to produce a new, once-
a-week drug to treat Type 2 diabetes.

  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) 
“Insourcing” is a new term that 
perfectly describes this new develop-
ment in the Greater Cincinnati region 
in 2007. TCS, the largest business 
conglomerate in India, announced that 
its North American Service Delivery 
Center would come to the area. The 
$20 million development is expected 
to eventually employ approximately 
1,000 software engineers, information 
technology consultants, sales staff and 
administrative support personnel.

Each of these projects will have a 
multiplier effect on the number of jobs 
created as suppliers, support industries, 
and general retailers arrive to serve their 
customers.

 
One of the top utilities 

Site Selection magazine named Duke 
Energy as one of the “Top 10 Utility 
Companies of the year” in economic  
development for the ninth consecutive 
year. The magazine based its selection  
on total capital investment, investment  
per capita, total jobs created and jobs 
created per capita.

Sustainable communities

The cost and reliability of energy supplies 
are only two of many factors that concern 
our customers and communities. less 
obvious aspects of economic development 
include the quality of educational facilities, 
parks and recreational opportunities and 
arts and cultural amenities, all of which 
make cities and towns desirable and 
sustainable places to grow a business. To 
help make our communities more sustain-
able, Duke Energy offers a Web-based 
assessment tool for community leaders at 
www.global-community.org/duke-energy.

“Bioscience brings highways, jobs, investment in research  

and medical breakthroughs that benefit the people of Ohio  

and people around the world.”

WABASH RIVER ENHANCEMENT CORP.
The Duke Energy Foundation contributed toward phase 1 of the four-county Wabash 
river (Ind.) Corridor master plan. This plan will focus on sustainable opportunities for 
economic development, recreation, education, health and environmental management. 
This is the first regional planning effort for the entire corridor and not just for a section 
within a specific political jurisdiction.

CAROLINA THREAD TRAIL
Duke Energy is the lead corporate sponsor of this effort to connect 15 counties in N.C. 
and S.C. with a system of greenways and trails. We have committed $4.5 million in 
cash, land, and in-kind resources toward this project that future generations will enjoy. 
The Trust for Public land will provide technical assistance to communities throughout 
the planning and design process. Catawba lands Conservancy is the lead agency for 
the project.

STUDENTS GET HANDS-ON TRAINING IN ARGENTINA
As part of its community relations and sustainability program, DEI Argentina started a 
training school, Generar, to provide training on power plant operations, maintenance 
and safety to technical school students. Through Generar, Duke Energy contributes to 
the development and education of young men and women interested in a career in the 
energy industry.

Public safety outreach

Diverse supplier spending

Spending for goods and services  
provided by minority- and woman- 
owned businesses increased considerably, 
from $143.2 million in 2006 to $187 
million in 2007. This 31 percent increase 
significantly exceeded our goal of a  
5 percent increase, or $150.4 million.
There were two major reasons: One 
was a large increase in spending with a 
principal supplier; the other was improved 
record-keeping. We are consolidating data 
from accounts payable systems used by 
our Midwest and Carolinas operations and 
have better data on small purchases made 
with company credit cards. Both improve-
ments help us better track purchases from 
diverse suppliers.  

Duke Energy launched a comprehensive 
outreach and education campaign in 2007 
to promote public safety and educate 
people on how to avoid the dangers of 
electricity and natural gas. The project was 
a joint effort between Duke Energy’s public 
safety team and various vendors. 

As part of the outreach campaign, a 
safety training kit was created for outside 
contractors, emergency response agencies 
and schools. Nearly 80,000 kits contain-
ing a safety brochure and poster were 
distributed. The kits also included informa-
tion on how to receive additional safety 
booklets, equipment decals and a DVD/CD 
containing a video, PowerPoint slide show, 
presenter notes and a trainer’s guide.
Duke Energy also uses bill inserts 
on safety to reach customers. radio ads 
promote electric and natural gas safety, 
complementing safety demonstrations.  
We reached more than 11,000 individuals 
with face-to-face presentations.

Global Service Event: part of the Duke Energy brand

Each spring, Duke Energy’s Global Service Event (GSE) encourages volunteerism and 
teamwork by helping employees identify, plan and execute projects that make a difference 
in their communities. 2007 was the 10th year of GSE – and the volunteer event  
has become an integral part of our company’s brand. 

During the 2007 GSE, more than 4,500 employees tackled 500 projects in 156 
communities, benefiting 376 different nonprofits. To put this into perspective, Duke 
Energy volunteers dedicated the equivalent of seven working years – roughly 15,000 
hours – to community service projects.

Volunteerism and service to community continues after retirement. In 2007,  
Duke Energy retirees in our 23 chapters volunteered an estimated 245,000 hours  
to support hundreds of charitable projects.

2007 community giving summary

Duke Energy contributes to its communities through civic leadership, volunteerism  
and contributions. While we often talk about the company’s giving in terms of the  
Duke Energy Foundation, that’s only part of the story.  

Each year, we aggregate all of the contributions made by Duke Energy, including 

Foundation and other cash contributions; in-kind gifts and services; and the contributions 
and the value of volunteerism of our employees and retirees. In 2007, charitable giving 
from the Duke Energy Foundation, Duke Energy Corporation and its employees and 
retirees totaled more than $31 million.

Influencing legislation  
and regulation

The greatest risks Duke Energy faces  
are “stroke of the pen” risks from legisla-
tion and regulation. In 2007, we spent 
approximately $2.8 million on federal 
lobbying efforts to ensure the voices of our 
company, shareholders and other stake-
holders were heard. Our lobbyists study 
proposed bills and regulations, consult  
with technical and financial specialists, 
and provide information to lawmakers so 
they can make informed decisions.

The Honest leadership and Open 
Government Act of 2007 was enacted in 
September to amend parts of the lobbying 
Disclosure Act of 1995. Among other 
provisions, the law now requires quarterly 
reports of lobbying activity and funding.  
Our first report under this law will be filed 
in April 2008.

WHAT PRICE CLIMATE 
LEGISLATION?
The importance of Duke Energy 
participating in the political process 
can be illustrated by the proposed 
lieberman-Warner climate legisla-
tion considered by Congress in 
2007. If that proposal were to  
be enacted in its current form,  
our customers’ bills could increase 
dramatically. We will continue  
to work with Congress to craft  
legislation that helps reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions without 
unfairly targeting customers who 
rely primarily on coal for energy 
generation.

Political involvement: DUkEPAC

DUkEPAC is a voluntary, nonpartisan political action committee that encourages 
employee participation in the political process and makes contributions to qualified 
candidates for public office. Administrative costs associated with operating DUkEPAC 
are paid by Duke Energy, as allowed by law. Employee contributions, all of which are 
voluntary, go to federal, state and local candidates. DUkEPAC is governed by a Board 
of Trustees comprised of company employees. Any DUkEPAC member may make a 
recommendation on candidates deserving support, but decisions on which candidates 
receive contributions are made by the DUkEPAC Board.

Standards of business conduct

GRASSROOTS INVOLVEMENT
Voices in Politics (VIP) is Duke Energy’s 
grassroots organization to educate 
employees on political issues and  
to seek their support on legislation 
important to the company. The VIP 
Web site for employees includes a 
variety of information, from how to 
register to vote to the most effective 
ways to communicate with legislators. 

WORLD’S MOST  
ETHICAL COMPANIES
Duke Energy has been named one of 
the World’s Most Ethical Companies  
by Ethisphere magazine, a national 
publication dedicated to the important 
correlation between ethics and profit-
ability. Only three electric utilities  
were selected and fewer than 100 
companies were identified worldwide.

All Duke Energy employees are subject 
to one or more specific codes of ethical 
conduct. The company conducts computer-
based training and/or classes to ensure 
understanding and compliance with 
company policies and government  
regulations. The more far-reaching codes 
and the employees affected include:

  Code of Business Ethics –  

All employees

  Code of Business Conduct  

and Ethics – Board of Directors

  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 

REpORTING CONCERNS

Standards/Code of Conduct – 
Employees with physical or electronic 
access to transmission or marketing 
information

  State Codes of Conduct – Employees 
who purchase or account for goods 
and services within or across state 
jurisdictions

  State Ethics Acts – Employees who 
interact with state public officials

  Honest Leadership and Open 
Government Act (HLOGA) –  
lobbyists as defined by HlOGA

Duke Energy strives to provide an environ-
ment in which employees feel free to raise 
work-related concerns without fear of 
intimidation or retaliation. Employees are 
encouraged to speak to their supervisors, 
but may seek resolution by talking to other 
members of management or to human 
resource specialists. Those who wish to 
remain anonymous have access to an 
independent external reporting system.  
All allegations are investigated and the 
results are reported to the Audit Committee 
of the board of directors.

Board of directors

An effective board of directors is considered 
one of the strongest indicators of share-
holder value and good governance. Elected 
annually, the 2008 slate of directors 
consists of 10 outside members in addition 
to Jim rogers, Duke Energy’s chairman, 
president and CEO. Ann Maynard Gray 
serves as lead director. In 2007, two new 
directors, Daniel r. DiMicco and Philip 
r. Sharp, were elected to the board. 
Information on all board members is avail-
able at www.duke-energy.com/corporate-
governance/board-of-directors/board.asp.

Several corporate governance changes 

and clarifications were made in 2007.  
These changes and clarifications included:  

  Clarification of the lead director’s  

Following the departure of board 

members who became directors of 
Spectra Energy Corp, the Duke Energy 
board determined that Jim rogers is its 
only non-independent director. Additional

Governance ratings
A number of independent organizations evaluate corporate governance. While we do  
not set goals for each rating, we do use them for benchmarking purposes.

Collaboration and 
stakeholder engagement

Building bridges from today to a low-
carbon future will require the best 
minds – and best leadership – of our 
time. Collaboration, communication and 
stakeholder engagement are defining 
characteristics of successful corporations.  
We have actively engaged stakeholders in 
energy efficiency collaboratives in each of 
our five states, organized dialogues among 
national advocacy groups, participated in 
regional discussions with water-use stake-
holders and conducted regular focus group 
sessions with customers. On page 41, we 
summarize some of the expectations of our 
stakeholders and how we respond to them.

Independent review

Duke Energy has invited Business for 
Social responsibility (BSr) to conduct 
an independent review of the company’s 
2007|2008 Sustainability Report. This 
is the second year we have provided our 
analysis of Duke Energy’s accomplish-
ments and areas for improvement in 
reporting sustainability performance  
following the merger of Cinergy and Duke 
Energy. It should be noted that our review 
neither verifies nor expresses an opinion  
on the accuracy, materiality, or complete-
ness of information provided in this report.
The significant strengths and achieve-
ments we observed in this year’s report 
include:

  linking sustainability and business 
strategy. This report moves beyond 
general discussions of sustainability 
risks and opportunities to show how 
these considerations have shaped core 
business decisions. For example, the 
report highlights how sustainability 
has informed investment in capital 
improvements, spurred the creation of 
a new business model, and is changing 
the future of Duke Energy’s generation 
portfolio. 

  response to stakeholder concerns 

about coal and nuclear generation. The 
CEO letter frankly acknowledges stake-
holder concern about the public health 
and climate change impacts of the new 
Cliffside 6 coal-fired plant and outlines 
the steps the company is taking to 
minimize and offset its CO2 emissions. 
The letter also discuses safe disposal of 
nuclear waste and Duke Energy’s active 
explorations of alternatives such as fuel 
recycling.

  Transparency. We observed several 

instances of open and honest discus-
sion of challenging issues and criticism 
in the report. Duke Energy success-
fully communicates the complexity 
and uncertainty involved in striving to 
reduce carbon emissions given current 
business, technical, and regulatory 
constraints (see p.8-9). The company 
also directly responds to critics who 
see a contradiction between its pursuit 
of increased generation using coal 
technology and its public commitment 
to reducing climate change (p.6). 

In future reports, we encourage  
Duke Energy to strive for the following:

  Continued improvement in report-

ing performance. This year’s report 
describes the concrete actions taken 
to achieve each sustainability goal 
and reflects a key recommendation 
from our last review to demonstrate 
progress against the Sustainability Plan. 
Next year we look for Duke Energy to 
enhance its measurement of perfor-
mance by: including more indicators 
of the impact of these activities, and 
placing performance in context by 
tracking these indicators over time and 
against the social and environmental 
outcomes the company seeks to 
achieve. 

Integrate other voices and perspectives. 
While the company has acknowledged 
stakeholder criticism, we encourage 
Duke to consider including commentar-
ies from independent, external voices 
in future reports, especially on timely 
and contentious conversations such 

as the role of nuclear power, customer 
rates, and US climate change policy. 
By incorporating and responding to 
different perspectives, the company 
will deepen stakeholders’ knowledge 
and understanding of how Duke Energy 
approaches these issues. 

  Share how Duke Energy is creating 
a ‘culture of sustainability’ to drive 
innovation. Creating a “culture” of 
sustainability in the company is identi-
fied in this report as a crucial part of 
achieving the sustainability goals and 
encouraging the innovation necessary 
to meet the 2030 carbon challenge. 
The establishment of a formal manage-
ment structure for sustainability is a 
step in this direction. We look forward 
to hearing how Duke Energy is cultivat-
ing a culture of sustainability amongst 
all employees; finding ways to nurture 
innovation internally to meet the 2030 
challenge; and creatively drawing 
on the expertise and imagination of 
external stakeholders in pursuit of  
these goals.

ment structure for sustainability is a 

step in this direction. We look forward 

to hearing how Duke Energy is cultivat-

ing a culture of sustainability amongst 

all employees; finding ways to nurture 

innovation internally to meet the 2030 

challenge; and creatively drawing 

on the expertise and imagination of 

external stakeholders in pursuit of  

these goals.

Non-GAAP financial measures

2007 ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS pER ShARE (“EpS”)

Duke Energy’s 2007/2008 Sustainability report references 2007 ongoing diluted EPS of $1.24. The 
Sustainability report also references the company’s 2007 employee incentive target of $1.15. The 
EPS measure used for employee incentive bonuses is based on ongoing diluted EPS. Ongoing diluted 
EPS is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure, as it represents 
diluted EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for the per-share impact of special items. Special 
items represent certain charges and credits which management believes will not be recurring on a 
regular basis. The following is a reconciliation of reported diluted EPS from continuing operations to 
ongoing diluted EPS for 2007:

ANTICIpATED ONGOING DILUTED EpS GROWTh RATES ThROUGh 2012

Duke Energy’s 2007|2008 Sustainability Report references the expected range of growth of 5 to 7% 
in ongoing diluted EPS through 2012 (on a compound annual growth rate (“CAGr”) basis). These 
growth percentages are based on anticipated ongoing diluted EPS amounts for future periods. Ongoing 
diluted EPS measure is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents anticipated diluted EPS from 
continuing operations, adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items represent certain 
charges and credits which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis. The most 
directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing diluted EPS is reported diluted EPS from continuing 
operations which includes the impact of special items. Due to the forward-looking nature of ongoing 
diluted EPS, and related growth rates, for future periods, information to reconcile such non-GAAP 
financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this 
time, as management is unable to forecast special items for future periods.

FORECASTED 2008 ONGOING SEGmENT AND TOTAL SEGmENT EBIT

Duke Energy’s 2007/2008 Sustainability report includes a discussion of forecasted 2008 ongoing 
EBIT for each of Duke Energy’s reportable segments as a percentage of forecasted 2008 ongoing total 
segment EBIT. Forecasted 2008 ongoing segment and total segment EBIT amounts are non-GAAP 
financial measures, as they reflect segment and total segment EBIT, adjusted for the impact of special 
items. Special items represent certain charges and credits which management believes will not be 
recurring on a regular basis. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for forecasted ongoing 
segment EBIT is reported segment EBIT from continuing operations, which includes the impact 
of special items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing total segment EBIT is 
reported total segment EBIT, which includes the impact of special items. Due to the forward-looking 
nature of these non-GAAP financial measures for future periods, information to reconcile these 
non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not  
available at this time, as management is unable to forecast special items for future periods.
