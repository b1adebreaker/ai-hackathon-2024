2012 Sustainability Report

It’s a new day 
at Duke Energy. 

Our merger with Progress Energy in 2012 has made us a stronger company,  
better able to meet the challenges of today’s energy landscape, and tomorrow’s.

the Chairman

James E. Rogers l Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Dear Stakeholders: 

Sustainability is a journey that requires a long view and a broad 
stakeholder perspective, as well as collaboration and perseverance. 

Duke Energy’s Sustainability Report demonstrates these and 
other dimensions of doing business in a way that’s good for 
people, the planet and profits. 

In spring 2013, we reflect on the 
transformative year behind us and 
our readiness for the road ahead. 

I’m grateful for our employees’ resilience 
during 18 months of uncertainty until 
we closed the merger of Duke Energy 
and Progress Energy on July 2, 2012. 

I’m also proud of the way they pulled 
together afterward. As you will read 
in this report, they turned 2012 into 
a year of great accomplishments.

Despite complex issues still in front of 
us, we’re on our way to realizing the 
tremendous potential of Duke Energy. 
Our new logo on the cover is symbolic 
of this new beginning, in our first full 
year since becoming the largest electric 
utility in the United States.

What matters most is what we do now, 
and how we do it.

A stakeholder approach
Duke Energy is focused on those who 
have a major stake in our performance 
today and in the future:

   Our customers and communities, 
who depend on us 24/7 for a vital 
service, constructive partnership 
and responsible stewardship

   Our investors, who choose us for 
a reliable dividend and earnings 
growth potential

   Our employees, who seek to 

make a difference in a mission 
that matters, while advancing in 
a performance culture guided by 
the right values.

These and other diverse stakeholders 
often have competing priorities. We 
aim for the right long-term balance that 
strengthens trust and confidence in 
our company and helps us be a truly 
sustainable organization.

The more important an issue is to 
our stakeholders and to our business 
success, the more it matters to us.

For customers
Delivering cost savings and other 
benefits to our customers was a 
driving force behind the combination 
of Duke Energy and Progress Energy. 
It’s particularly important given the 
need to mitigate the rising costs in 
today’s electric utility industry.

Our core mission is to provide 
affordable, reliable, increasingly clean 
energy — in safe and sustainable ways 
— to our customers 24/7. Today’s 
Duke Energy serves 7.2 million retail 
electricity customers in six states in the 
Southeast and the Midwest. We also 
serve 500,000 natural gas customers 
in Ohio and Kentucky. Our commercial 
businesses supply power to communi-
ties across the United States and in 
seven Latin American countries.

Customers and communities

$687m
$3.5b

On track to deliver  
$687 million in merger-
related savings 

Attracted more than 
$3.5 billion in investments 
to local economies

Our company also plays an 
instrumental role in fostering job 
creation in our communities. In 
2012, Duke Energy, along with what 
Progress Energy accomplished earlier 
in the year, helped attract more than 
$3.5 billion in investment in new and 
expanded businesses in our service 
areas, representing approximately 
13,000 jobs. 

Thanks to the merger, our customers 
are benefiting from the efficiency and 
flexibility of operating our power plants 
in the Carolinas as one integrated 
fleet. We achieved about $52 million 
in fuel and joint-dispatch savings in 
the first six months as a combined 
company, outpacing our initial 
expectations. And we are on track to 
meet the $687 million merger-related 
savings commitment to our Carolinas 
customers over the next five years. 

Our storm-response capability is one 
example of our combined strength. As 
a result of our size, we’re now able to 
mobilize more crews and equipment 
more effectively. When Superstorm 
Sandy ripped through the northern 
and mid-Atlantic states last fall, we 
sent nearly 3,000 employees and 
contractors to help other utilities 
restore power. 

For communities
Our mission goes beyond providing an 
essential service to customers. We also 
promote the vitality and success of the 
communities where our employees live 
and work. 

The employees of this company are 
actively involved in helping their 
communities, on and off the job. Each 
year we make significant contributions 
through the philanthropy of The 
Duke Energy Foundation, and the 
volunteerism and civic leadership of 
our employees and retirees. 

For investors
Another major driving force for the 
merger was to increase the investment 
value for our shareholders. It’s working. 

From the merger announcement in 
January 2011 through the end of 
2012, Duke Energy’s total shareholder 
return was approximately 32 
percent, significantly outperforming 
the 17 percent return of both the 
S&P 500 and the Philadelphia 
Utility Index (UTY), a composite 
of 20 U.S. utilities. 

In 2012, we delivered adjusted diluted 
earnings per share of $4.32, near the 
top end of our target range of $4.20 
to $4.35 for the year. Our dividend 
is also an important part of the value 
proposition we offer shareholders. 
In 2012, we raised our quarterly 
cash dividend to shareholders by 
approximately 2 percent.

2013 is our 87th consecutive year 
of paying a quarterly cash dividend 
on our common stock. Based on the 
current amount, we are paying more 
than $2.1 billion in dividends annually.

For employees
I am impressed by our employees’ 
clear focus on our mission and their 
commitment to finding better ways 
to carry it out.

In 2012, employees finished the 
year with the lowest safety Total 
Incident Case Rate in our company’s 
history. Tragically, an employee 
died after being rear-ended by a 
vehicle, and a contractor was fatally 

injured. Early in 2013, we lost three 
additional teammates. 

As CEO, there is nothing more painful 
to me than hearing about an employee 
or contractor who has been killed or 
seriously injured. As a company, we 
are increasing our commitment to 
safety and will continue to strive for 
zero injuries and fatalities. 

Going forward, we continue to 
strengthen our culture of engaged 
employees and high performance. 
We are guided by our values: 
safety, integrity, accountability, 
respect, communication, inclusion 
and teamwork.

Now that Duke Energy is the largest 
U.S. electric utility, we’re able to offer 
even broader career opportunities. 
We are attracting the next generation 
of talented, diverse employees. Our 
employees will help us improve, 
adapt and innovate for the challenges 
of the future. 

Readiness for the road ahead
Today’s Duke Energy has a unique 
blend of strengths. Our post-merger 
company has greater scale efficiencies 
and geographic diversity, as well as 
a more balanced, diversified power 
generation portfolio that continues 
to get cleaner and more efficient. 

As part of a $9 billion generation fleet 
modernization program in our regulated 
utilities, we brought three state-of-
the-art power plants into service in 
late 2012. When two more new plants 
come on line in 2013, we will have 
retired more than 3,400 megawatts 
of older coal-fired units. 

Our commercial and international 
energy businesses remain an important 
part of the Duke Energy portfolio. They 
provide diversity in revenue streams, 
geography and fuel mix. We’re also 
expanding our expertise in renewable 
energy. During 2012, we completed

the more it matters to us. ‘‘
‘‘The more important an issue is to our 

stakeholders and to our business success, 

five new wind farms and three new 
solar farms.

The history of Duke Energy includes 
more than a century of resilience 
and adaptation — through national 
economic booms and busts, energy 
crises, technological innovations, 
volatile fuel prices and a shifting 
landscape of government policies 
and regulations. 

Greater transformation lies ahead for 
our company and our industry. Current 
drivers of change include the shale 
gas revolution, emerging technologies 
and anemic growth in energy usage. 
Also, our nation needs to address 
global climate change in a more 
comprehensive way. 

Our company must anticipate and 
adapt to this fluid business environ-
ment. Our sustainability journey is 
a critical part of our readiness for 
the future. 

A personal journey
As announced, I will retire from Duke 
Energy by the end of 2013. So this is 
my last year at the company — and 
my 25th as a CEO in this industry. 

Naturally, I’ve also reflected on my own 
journey in this business, dating back to 
1988 at PSI Energy (now Duke Energy 
Indiana), a small, coal-based utility 
based in Plainfield, Ind. Early on, I saw 
environmental leadership as an integral 
part of business strategy.

In 1990 at PSI, we created the first 
environmental charter ever passed by 
a utility company at the board level. 
I also supported the 1990 federal 
acid-rain legislation and, over the 
last decade, have been advocating 
for our nation to take stronger action 
on climate change. 

I’m grateful for the support of 
exceptional leaders, board members 
and employees throughout my career. 
Such collaboration enabled us to 
accomplish many things over my 
25 years. 

We’ve delivered total shareholder 
returns at an average rate above 
12 percent per year. In recent 
years, we’ve made great strides in 
modernizing our generation fleet. 
And Duke Energy was named to 
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
for North America in 2012, for the 
seventh consecutive year.

I’ve always tried to anticipate what’s 
coming — and what’s possible. 
That’s often caused me to challenge 
conventional wisdom. I’ve also learned 
to listen for what’s really on people’s 
minds — and to foster a performance 
culture that empowers people and 
drives results through collaboration. 

The “grandchildren’s test” has long 
been my standard for creating a 
sustainable future. This is how I 
described it in my 2003 annual report 
letter as chairman of Cinergy (since 

merged with Duke Energy): “Decades 
from now, when our children and 
grandchildren look back at what we 
did as a company and the decisions 
we made, will they think we did the 
right thing?”

That’s still the right test today (when I 
have 11 grandchildren). And I feel good 
that Duke Energy is making sound, 
responsible decisions with the long 
view in mind. 

This company is well-positioned to 
adapt to a changing energy landscape. 
A decade from now, we will look 
back on 2012-2013 as a great new 
beginning for Duke Energy and the 
people who count on us. 

Sincerely,

James E. Rogers 
Chairman, President and 
Chief Executive Officer

Our Sustainability Plan and Goals

This sustainability plan 
reflects Duke Energy’s 
commitment to operate in a 
way that is good for people, 
the planet and profits. 

It is aligned with the company’s 
business strategy and values, 
and requires us to strike the 
right long-term balance among 
the interests of our diverse 
stakeholders. This plan was 
updated in early 2013, based on 
feedback from stakeholders and in 
light of our merger with Progress 
Energy. We received feedback from 
stakeholders representing customer, 
community, environmental, 
investment and academic 
organizations. 

Stakeholder input
While stakeholders felt that the five 
focus areas were still sound, they 
challenged us to develop additional 
goals, particularly in our fourth 
and fifth focus areas. To address 
this feedback, we have developed 
new community, governance and 
transparency goals. Most other 
goals have been updated to reflect 
the expanded footprint of the 
merged company. 

What it includes
The “What it includes” section 
is new to this plan. It was added 
to address stakeholder requests 
for better clarity on key activities 
and programs within our five 
focus areas. This section does 
not endeavor to include every 
sustainability initiative under way 
at Duke Energy — and there are 
many. This plan will continue 
to evolve to reflect stakeholder 
feedback and our changing 
business environment.

We will report on our progress 
against these goals in future 
sustainability reports.

Expanding our energy 
efficiency offerings

Duke Energy continues to expand its 
portfolio of energy efficiency products 
and services — offering customers 
more ways to take control of their 
energy usage and save money, plus 
benefit the environment.

New in 2012 was My Home Energy 
Report, sent via U.S. mail to eligible 
residential customers in North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky and 
Indiana. The report engages customers 
by showing them how their energy 
use stacks up against their neighbors’. 
Simple bar graphs compare their actual 
energy usage to the average home 
and an efficient home of similar size, 
age and location (based on publicly 
available tax records). The report also 
provides targeted and actionable tips to 
help customers become more energy 
efficient and save on their energy bills. 

More than 1 million Duke Energy 
customers are receiving the report 
about eight times a year, and they’re 
expected to save an average of 
2 percent, or approximately $20 on 
their annual energy costs, just by 
making simple behavioral changes 
at home.

Another program, expanded in 2012, 
helps customers dispose of older, 
less-efficient refrigerators and freezers, 
often located in garages and other 
unconditioned spaces. Through the 
company’s Appliance Recycling 
program, eligible customers can receive 
a $30 or $50 cash incentive for 
recycling a refrigerator or freezer. And 
by not running that extra appliance, 
they can save up to $150 each year 
on their energy bills. 

Duke Energy’s recycling partner will 
even pick up the old appliances — for 
free — and recycle 95 percent of their 
components. More than 27,000 refrig-
erators and freezers have been recycled 
since the program began in 2010.

A simple and inexpensive way for 
customers to save energy is by 
changing their light bulbs. We offer free 
or discounted compact fluorescent 
light (CFL) bulbs to eligible customers. 
CFLs last up to 10 times longer than 
incandescent bulbs and use up to 
75 percent less electricity. On average, 
each CFL saves about $40 in energy 
costs over the expected lifetime of 
the bulb. Since 2010, Duke Energy 
and Progress Energy combined have 
distributed nearly 37 million CFLs 
throughout our service areas. That’s 
enough energy saved to power more 

than 97,000 residential homes and 
offset the carbon output of 205,000 
passenger cars. 

Our Neighborhood Energy Saver 
program provides information and 
energy-saving tools to customers who 
live in low-income neighborhoods. 
Nearly 30,000 Progress Energy 
customers have benefited from this 
program since it started in 2006. 
Duke Energy will launch a similar 
program this year.  

Duke Energy’s business and 
institutional customers also continue 
to benefit from energy-saving offers 
and incentives. For example, they can 
receive cash incentives for installing 
high-efficiency lighting, HVAC systems, 
pumps and other qualifying equipment. 
The use of energy efficient equipment 
enables our business customers to 
improve their bottom lines by reducing 
energy consumption. The incentives 
also help lower the costs associated 
with upgrades. 

These are only a few of the energy-
saving products and services Duke 
Energy offers. More information about 
specific programs in each state we 
serve is available in the “Save Energy 
& Money” sections of duke-energy.com

Digital grid drives 
customer benefits

The 2012 merger of Duke Energy 
and Progress Energy brought together 
two industry leaders in power 
grid modernization. Now, as one 
company, we are deploying distribution 
management systems (DMS) that 
are transforming the way we deliver 
energy — and delivering real benefits 
to our customers. 

In the past, the power grid has relied 
on operator-controlled systems, kind 
of like the cars of the past. The car’s 
dashboard gave you feedback on what 
was happening — how fast you were 
going, what gear you were using and 
how many miles you had driven. It 
might have alerted you if your oil level 
was low. But if you went into a skid, 
it was all up to you to control your 
vehicle and avoid an accident.

In today’s cars, computerized safety 
systems, such as antilock brakes and 
electronic stability control, help you 
respond to such a situation. In an 
instant, the computer system analyzes 
what’s happening and helps stabilize 
the vehicle. 

In a similar way, a DMS uses system 
data to instantly analyze and react to 
what’s happening on the power grid, 
and makes real-time adjustments to 
better control the flow of electricity.  

For customers, that means:

Lower cost. DMS can quickly respond 
to power quality issues, such as a 
drop in voltage along a power line. 
And during periods of high demand 
for electricity, the system can make 
thousands of micro-adjustments to 
balance distribution. 

With a more efficient delivery system, 
we can save on the fuel needed to 
produce power and even reduce the 
need to build new plants — costs 
that would otherwise be passed on 
to customers.

 Energy makeovers

Native Floridian Melvin Philpot does what he loves and loves what he does. A 31-year 
employee, he comes to work every day with one mission in mind — to help customers 
save energy and money.

Philpot oversees the Neighborhood Energy Saver (NES) program, which began in 
Duke Energy’s Florida service territory in 2006. 

The NES team provides free home energy makeovers to those who need them most — 
low-income customers. The service includes the installation of up to 16 energy-saving 
improvements — from caulking and weatherstripping to compact fluorescent light bulbs. 

Philpot and his team also take the time to help customers understand the factors that 
contribute to high energy bills, and simple things they can do to save — like cleaning 
their refrigerator coils and turning down the thermostat. 

NES is now available to customers in 32 Florida communities. And Philpot walks the talk 
at home — his townhouse is a model of energy efficiency. He even shared his know-how 
with neighboring utility Florida Power & Light, which brought its version of the program to 
his hometown.

“What we’re doing with our low-income neighbors has made our customers, regulators 
and other utilities look at what we do in a different light,” said Philpot. “Most importantly, 
we’re helping people and the environment by saving energy.”

Greater reliability. DMS can detect 
outages and restore service quickly 
— often in seconds. For equipment 
hiccups requiring hands-on repairs, it 
can alert crews to the precise place and 
problem. And it can manage a virtually 
unlimited number and combination of 
grid challenges simultaneously.

Cleaner energy. A smarter, more 
responsive digital grid is better able to 
accommodate the intermittent nature 

of renewable energy, like solar and 
wind power. 

Like the evolution of the automobile, 
power grid modernization is a process 
that will never be finished. The “smart 
grid” keeps getting smarter, as new 
technologies become available to make 
it more efficient and reliable.

Underground transformer

Yael “Ya-Ya” Benford has always taken to roles traditionally 
filled by men. Her first job at 14 was selling soda and popcorn at 
Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. Now a licensed electrician, she 
traveled with her Duke Energy teammates to Lower Manhattan 
to help restore power after Superstorm Sandy.

“When I look at ya-ya, I see an expert, not a gender,” said Jimmy 
Lee, a 25-year Duke Energy veteran. “She’s just as tough as the 
guys. Maybe tougher!”

ya-ya is an underground serviceperson for Duke Energy’s Network 
Services crew in Cincinnati — and she’s often the first one to go 
underground at a work site.

Although ya-ya has earned the respect of her managers and 
co-workers, being a woman in a job and an industry dominated by 
men has not been easy.

“There was a point during my pregnancy when I wasn’t comfortable 
doing my job,” said ya-ya. “This work takes a toll on your body.”

Human Resources worked with ya-ya and her managers to identify 
different roles she could fill during her pregnancy. She returned to work 
a short time after giving birth to a healthy baby boy, Naaman, now 6.

Said ya-ya: “I love being a mom, but I just couldn’t wait to get back 
to work — and back underground.”

2012: A year for wind 
and solar investment

Renewable energy is playing an 
increasingly important role in how 
Duke Energy provides electricity to 
businesses and households across 
the U.S. 

Between the investments made by 
Duke Energy Renewables and our 
regulated businesses, the company’s 
solar and wind energy resources can 
serve about a half-million homes. 

Duke Energy Renewables 
Duke Energy Renewables added nearly 
650 megawatts (MW) of wind and 
solar capacity across the U.S. in 2012, 
an all-time high for our nonregulated 
renewable energy business.

This business has matured in just a 
few years. Since it began in 2007, 
Duke Energy Renewables has invested 
more than $2.5 billion in renewable 
energy and now owns over 1,700 MW 
of wind and solar generation capacity. 

In 2012, Duke Energy forged a joint-
venture partnership with Sumitomo, 
a 400-year-old Japanese company, 
to build two Kansas wind projects 
(Ironwood and Cimarron II). This 
lowered each company’s financial 
investment, and provides enough 
wind capacity to power about 90,000 
Kansas homes.  

They say everything is bigger in 
Texas, and that’s certainly true for the 
company’s renewable energy ventures. 
At Los Vientos I and II, we built and

began operating more than 400 MW 
of wind power capacity in 2012. These 
are now the largest wind farms in 
our portfolio.

In 2012, Duke Energy Renewables 
also completed the acquisition of 
Outland Energy Services, a Minnesota-
based company specializing in 
wind power facility operations and 
maintenance services. Renamed 
Duke Energy Renewable Services, the 
service provider is helping Duke Energy 
Renewables more effectively and 
efficiently maintain its approximately 
1,600-MW wind energy fleet — and 
those capabilities can be marketed to 
other wind farm operators as well.

In addition, in 2012 Duke Energy 
Renewables completed the 12-MW 
Washington White Post solar facility 
near Bath, N.C., and acquired one 
solar project (Gato Montes) and 
completed another (Black Mountain) in 
Arizona, adding 14 MW in that state. 

Regulated utilities 
In the Carolinas, the company’s 
regulated utilities began purchasing an 
additional 106 MW of solar energy in 
2012, for a total of 150 MW of solar 
across the two states. Our remaining 
regulated service areas started 
purchasing an additional 10 MW of 
solar energy in 2012, for a total of 
25 MW across those states. As solar 
costs decline, we expect this rapid 
growth, as we’ve seen particularly 
in the Carolinas, to continue. 

Customer participation in Duke 
Energy Progress’ and Duke Energy 
Florida’s innovative SunSense® solar 
photovoltaic (PV) programs also grew 
in 2012. These programs, which 
began in 2011, provide incentives to 
qualifying customers who install solar 
generation. Today, SunSense has 
approximately 600 participants.

which also received battery backup 
systems. In addition, the University 
of Florida was the recipient of a 
100-kilowatt solar PV array, based 
on its commitment to offer renewable 
energy education and resource tools 
to its students. 

In South Carolina, as part of a merger 
commitment to our communities, 
Duke Energy has given the first 
half of a $2 million contribution to 
Palmetto Clean Energy (PaCE). PaCE 
is a nonprofit program designed to 
improve the environment by promoting 
the development of renewable energy 
resources in South Carolina.

We also fulfilled a merger commitment 
of $2 million to NC GreenPower, 
an independent, nonprofit program 
dedicated to providing more renewable 
energy sources in North Carolina.

Through programs and efforts like 
these, Duke Energy is well-positioned 
to meet state renewable energy 
standards and effectively manage 
the costs that customers pay for 
renewable energy.

Charged up over energy storage

Duke Energy is getting charged up 
about batteries — and their potential 
for strengthening the power grid and 
adding renewable energy.

The company matched a $22 million 
grant from the U.S. Department 
of Energy to install a large-scale 
battery energy-storage system at our 
153-megawatt (MW) Notrees wind 
farm in Texas.

Completed in late 2012, the storage 
system is one of the largest of its kind 
in the world. The system can store 
24 megawatt-hours of electricity, 
enough to power about 18,000 
average homes for one hour.

In Florida, solar PV panels have 
been installed through the SunSense 
program at 38 schools, nine of 

Battery storage can smooth out the 
inevitable weather-related fluctuations 
in wind and solar generation, making 

the power system more reliable. It can 
also respond almost instantly to spikes 
in energy demand. 

Energy storage is nothing new to 
Duke Energy. The company has had 
pumped-storage hydro projects for 
years. During off-peak periods, these 
systems pump and store water for use 
in generating hydroelectric power when 
demand rises.

But storage using batteries promises 
valuable new options — especially in 
the area of grid stabilization.

At the Rankin Substation in Gaston 
County, N.C., a battery system is 
smoothing out large minute-by-minute 
production peaks and valleys from 
a 1.2-MW solar project a few miles 
away. It was honored by POWERGRID 
magazine as Project of the Year for 
integrating renewable energy into 
the grid.

Another project stores electricity 
produced by a 1-MW solar installation 
at Marshall Steam Station in Catawba 
County, N.C., and discharges it directly 
to the grid when needed. 

Both projects are helping Duke Energy 
keep the grid stable when intermittent 
renewable generation is connected.

The company is also testing small 
battery systems at customers’ homes 
and businesses in Charlotte, N.C., 
and Carmel, Ind., for a variety of 
capabilities, including solar integration 
and backup power.

But Duke Energy isn’t stopping there. 
In 2013, the company will kick off a 
pilot project to repurpose previously 
used Chevy Volt batteries on the 
company’s distribution system. With 
about 70 percent of their original 
capacity remaining, used auto batteries 
may have a useful second life — 
boosting the reliability of the electric 
grid. This would also make used

Keeping energy affordable

As a regulated utility, Duke Energy 
works to balance the company’s 
obligation to provide safe, reliable 
and increasingly clean energy with 
the need to keep rates affordable for 
our customers. 

Affordable rates for homes, small 
businesses and large industry are key 
to economic growth in the communities 
we serve. Our competitive rates help 
make our service territories attractive for 
domestic and international businesses 
looking to relocate. 

Over the past several years, Duke 
Energy has been making significant 
investments to install advanced 
energy technologies and replace 
aging infrastructure. These changes 
include replacing older, less efficient 
coal plants with new, more efficient 
advanced-coal and natural gas-fired 
facilities. We have also modernized 
our transmission and distribution 
systems with digital technology. Those 
investments will reduce emissions and 
ensure a reliable and efficient supply 
of energy for future generations. 

But those improvements cost money.

Working to tame the storm

Few people think about electricity — 
until it goes out.

And no one is better equipped to 
restore power than Duke Energy line 
workers. In fall 2012, Superstorm 
Sandy ripped through the northern 
and mid-Atlantic states, leaving 
millions in the dark — but only 
minor damage to the company’s 
own territories.

Coming to the aid of other utilities, 
almost 3,000 Duke Energy employees 
and contractors worked to restore 
power in eight states. It was our largest 
response ever to a storm outside of 
the company’s service area.

We won some new friends, too. One 
morning in Dover, N.J., employees 
found sticky notes attached to 
50 Duke Energy trucks in a staging 
area — with messages like “Thanks 
for the help. Love, Jersey.”

Closer to home, Duke Energy has 
worked to reduce the duration of 
outages caused by storms and lessen 
their impact on our own customers.

So we’re ready for what nature has in 
store, the company’s meteorologists 
provide critical information about the 
size, scope and severity of storms 
headed for Duke Energy’s service 
areas — from Indiana blizzards to 
Florida hurricanes.

When a strong wind system ripped 
through the company’s Midwest 
territory in June 2012, Duke Energy 
set up temporary staging areas near 
the hardest-hit locations, making it 
more convenient for crews to work in 
remote areas and have supplies for 
repairs nearby.

We quickly moved Duke Energy 
workers from the Carolinas. And, as 
in the past, we drew on assistance 
from utilities in 10 states through the 
Southeastern Electric Exchange and 
the Great Lakes Mutual Assistance 
Group — giving us emergency access 
to help from 25 of our peer companies. 

In Ohio, the company has been 
installing smart grid technologies 
for the past three years. During the 
2012 storm, we were able to tell 
which electric meters were inactive — 
enabling line crews to respond faster 
to those without power.

Duke Energy will never be able to 
eliminate storms or all outages. But 
through better information, improved 
work processes and sharing of 
personnel, we can move more quickly 
to get the lights back on.

RELIABLE POwER: A KEY PARt OF OUR MISSION

With a service area that encompasses 104,000 square miles and more than 
7 million electric customers, reliability is an everyday commitment for Duke 
Energy employees. 

Each year, we set aggressive reliability targets for the number and duration 
of power outages and the performance of our power generation fleet. As 
we implement best practices and consistent approaches across the newly 
merged company, our customers should continue to expect improved 
reliability performance.

Power delivery
Measures used to monitor our reliability trended in the right direction 
during 2012, with decreases in the number and duration of power outages 
experienced by customers. This table reflects the combined outage history 
of Duke Energy and Progress Energy since 2008.

Climate change update

Duke Energy believes U.S. climate 
change policy is an important issue. 
We’re committed to working with 
Congress and the White House to 
develop federal policies that would 
gradually lower greenhouse gas 
emissions over time, and that would 
not adversely affect the U.S. economy 
or our ability to continue providing 
affordable, reliable electricity to our 
more than 7 million customers.

Congress took no action on climate 
policy in 2012, and is unlikely to 
do so in 2013 due to deep political 
divisions on the issue. However, 
President Obama, during his 2013 
State of the Union address, pledged 
to address climate change, with or 
without Congress.

In the absence of Congressional action, 
the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency continues to act. In 2012, the 
agency proposed a rule that would 
limit carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
from certain types of fossil-fueled 
power plants that are permitted and 

16

constructed in the future. The agency 
is also expected to propose a rule to 
regulate CO2 emissions from existing 
power plants, although the timing of 
that rule is unknown.

Regardless of what happens in 
Washington, Duke Energy continues 
to move toward a lower-carbon future 
through an aggressive power plant 
modernization program. And in our 
planning for new power plants to meet 
future customer demand, we consider 
scenarios that include a price on 
CO2 emissions.

By retiring old coal plants, deploying 
clean energy technologies and 
improving energy efficiency (what we 
call “the fifth fuel”), the company is 
reducing the amount of carbon emitted 
per unit of electricity generated — a 
measure known as “carbon intensity.” 
Though Duke Energy is the largest 
power generator among U.S.-based, 
investor-owned power companies and 
ranks second in carbon emissions, 
we are only 14th in carbon intensity, 
based on 2011 data (latest available).

New, cleaner units advance 
fossil fleet transition

By replacing older coal-fired generation 
with new, advanced-technology coal 
and natural gas plants, Duke Energy 
is delivering on its promise to deliver 
cleaner energy from a diverse mix of 
fuel sources. 

Duke Energy’s investment in five 
new plants (three completed in 2012 
and two in progress) totals $9 billion 
— allowing the company to retire 
approximately 3,400 megawatts 
(MW) in older coal units by the end 
of 2013. That number will grow to 
nearly 6,300 MW over the next few 
years. The company has invested 
another $7.5 billion in plant upgrades 
at other units to reduce air emissions 
and improve air quality across our 
service areas. 

All of these fleet modernization invest-
ments have reduced our emissions 
of sulfur dioxide by 83 percent 
and nitrogen oxides by 64 percent 
since 2005. About 82 percent of 
the domestic coal fleet is scrubbed 

DUkE ENERGy 2012 SUSTAINABILITy REPORT

currently, with that approaching 
nearly 100 percent once upcoming 
retirements occur.

This work to modernize our fossil 
plants will help Duke Energy 
achieve compliance with upcoming 
environmental regulations. We 
estimate investing another $5 billion 
to $6 billion in the next decade to 
prepare for anticipated new regulations, 
primarily in the water and waste 
management areas.

This article continues online, with 
details about the 2012 completion of 
three new additions to Duke Energy’s 
fossil fleet in North Carolina — the 
cleaner-coal Cliffside Steam Station 
and two highly efficient natural gas 
plants, H.F. Lee and Dan River. Also 
read about two plants in progress 
— the Sutton natural gas plant 
under construction in North Carolina 
and the Edwardsport gasification 
plant undergoing start-up testing 
in Indiana. See the Environmental 
Footprint section of our online

Merger paying off with cost 
savings and environmental 
benefits

Duke Energy’s merger with Progress 
Energy was completed in early July 
2012. As part of our merger agreement, 
Duke Energy promised to deliver 
$687 million in customer savings 
over five years. The savings accrue 
through two efficiency strategies: 
reducing fuel costs ($331 million) 
and the joint dispatch of the Carolinas 
generation fleet ($356 million). These 
efficiency strategies also reduce our 
environmental impact.

As of year-end 2012, we had delivered 
nearly $52 million in fuel and joint 
dispatch savings, well over half of our 
12-month goal of $70 million.

LIVINg It:   

Go-to guy for wildlife

tom Knapke isn’t one to talk about sustainability. He’d rather show you.

As environmental coordinator at Cayuga Station, knapke has been showing his Indiana 
neighbors for years how power plants and the surrounding wildlife can thrive together.

Case in point: the station’s popular Eagle Viewing Day event. Eagles have returned to 
Cayuga for the past 25 years — fishing in the warm discharge waters of the power plant. 
About 24,000 visitors have flocked to the station to see them in the wild since the first 
event 18 years ago.

In partnership with the American Eagle Foundation, knapke has also helped the 
organization’s “Birds of Prey” show travel to 39 local schools.

In 2012, he worked with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the local 
Ducks Unlimited chapter to band more than 150 geese near the station, to track their 
migration. About 30 schoolchildren were there to help.

And through the station’s “Wonders of the Wetlands” program, knapke teaches students 
about river ecology, wetlands functions, vegetation and the history of the area.

No wonder the station was named a 2012 Friend of Conservation by the Indiana 
Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts.

“Many people have lived in the Wabash River area all their lives, but have never actually 
been down to the river to see it up close,” said knapke. “It may take awhile, but we’re 
looking to change that.”

Fuel savings
Fuel savings are accumulating quickly, 
largely due to coal blending. Illinois 
Basin and Northern Appalachian 
coals are currently less expensive 
than the Central Appalachian coals 
that our plants in the Carolinas have 
traditionally burned. 

Advanced emission controls at some 
of our larger stations allow us to 
burn mixtures containing more of the 
less expensive coal, and still comply 
with environmental regulations. 
We’re planning additional equipment 
upgrades to improve coal blending 
and combustion capabilities at other 
plants as well.

systems at the least cost. And running 
the most efficient plants across the two 
systems helps lower air emissions.

The two neighboring utilities are 
moving as much as 2,000 MW of 
electricity between them daily. In 
just the first two weeks as a merged 
company, we realized almost a 
half-million dollars in joint dispatch-
related savings, which grew to 
$14 million by year-end 2012.

Various initiatives are under way to 
save even more. No utilities have 

attempted joint dispatch on a large 
scale with such complexity before, 
and there is a steep learning curve. 
We expect these savings to increase 
with operational experience.

Shale gas shows continued 
promise for power generation

Increased domestic reserves, lower 
prices and fewer emissions than 
coal-fired generation are factors that 
are moving natural gas-fired plants 
up in Duke Energy’s dispatch order. 

Testing of the new, lower-cost fuel 
blends is going better than anticipated. 
At several plants, we’re burning up to 
100 percent non-Central Appalachian 
coal to produce power. 

Reducing our reliance on Central 
Appalachian coal means we will likely 
be purchasing less coal mined through 
mountaintop removal — a controversial 
surface mining technique that’s 
accomplished by removing the tops 
of mountains in order to reach coal 
seams. Approximately 25 percent of 
Central Appalachian coal is mined this 
way, while non-Central Appalachian 
coal tends to be mined through 
underground mining methods. 

The mountaintop removal mining 
method continues to face regulatory 
and cost challenges, so increased 
fuel flexibility allows Duke Energy 
to maintain a reliable fuel supply for 
our customers.

In addition to coal-related savings, 
Duke Energy has brought 2,760 
megawatts (MW) of natural gas 
capacity on line since 2011, and 
will add another 625 MW in 2013, 
allowing our customers to benefit from 
low prices for this commodity. The 
environment also benefits, because 
natural gas power plants have fewer 
air emissions than coal plants. 

We’ve realized more than $37 million in 
actual fuel savings through December 
2012. Through contracts, we have 
locked in an additional $238 million 
toward the projected $331 million in 
fuel savings over five years.

Joint dispatch
Our joint dispatch agreement allows 
Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke 
Energy Progress to share power from 
plants across the Carolinas. We can 
run the most efficient plants available 
from our combined generation fleet, in 
order to meet the total demand on both 

18

DUkE ENERGy 2012 SUSTAINABILITy REPORT

Access to large volumes of shale gas 
should provide the United States with 
more domestic natural gas than the 
country consumes for many years to 
come, according to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA). 

Natural gas-fired power plants emit 
about half as much carbon dioxide as 
coal-fired plants, and fewer nitrogen 
oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions 
as well. Combined-cycle plants have 
operational flexibility — they can start 
up and shut down quickly in response 
to changing demand on the electric 
system. And their use of heat released 
from natural gas combustion to 
produce additional power makes 
them highly efficient.  

Long-term projections for natural 
gas power production are promising. 
However, considering the historic 
volatility of natural gas prices (and 
other commodities), we need a 
well-balanced approach to our 
generation mix to ensure continued 
reliability and cost control.

Although the EIA predicts shale gas 
will provide approximately half of U.S. 
natural gas resources by 2035, others 
are concerned about the amount 
of water and chemicals required in 
the hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) 
process, and what that might mean 
for the environment and potential 
government regulations in the future. 

Shale gas has been termed a “game 
changer” for the U.S. due to the 
potential opportunities low-cost natural 
gas can provide for our nation. Yet 
the speed at which shale gas has 
developed and the uncertainty about 
the implications of fracking call for a 
cautious approach.

Duke Energy continues to monitor 
developments related to shale gas 
production, and we will incorporate 
those findings into our long-term 
generation and fuel plans.

3 + 4 = 1 nuclear fleet

It all adds up. With our recent merger, 
three legacy Duke Energy and four 
former Progress Energy nuclear plants 
have combined to create the largest 
regulated nuclear fleet in the U.S. 
Excluding the Crystal River Nuclear 
Plant in Florida, which is preparing for 
decommissioning, Duke Energy now 
operates more than 10,000 megawatts 
of nuclear generating capacity. The 
other six nuclear sites are located in 
the Carolinas.

Both Duke Energy and Progress Energy 
have long histories of operating nuclear 
plants safely and reliably — for more 
than 40 years. Robinson Nuclear 
Plant was the first of the fleet to begin 
commercial operation in 1971, soon 
followed by Oconee Nuclear Station’s 
three units. 

A key priority going forward is 
the seamless integration of our 
nuclear plants into one strong and 
cohesive fleet. Our highly skilled 
and talented team of nearly 7,000 
nuclear professionals is continuously 
focused on internalizing and sharing 
best practices in safety, reliability 
and efficiency. 

Efficient and reliable power
Our operational performance for the 
combined fleet was strong in 2012. 
Our nuclear capacity factor was 90.4 
percent (excluding the Crystal River 
plant, which has been out of operation 
since 2009). That achievement marked 
the 14th consecutive year Duke Energy 
nuclear plants have topped 90 percent. 

For our customers, that means efficient 
and reliable power, particularly during 
the hot summer months when they 
need it most — while reducing the 
need to operate less-efficient and 
higher-emitting generating stations. 

To meet future electricity demands, we 
have submitted license applications for 
potential new nuclear generating units in 

Cherokee County, S.C., Levy County, Fla., 
and Wake County, N.C. We anticipated 
receiving our construction and 
operating licenses for Cherokee and 
Levy in the 2013 time frame, but now 
expect industrywide regulatory issues 
to delay those dates. The timeline 
for licensing the potential new units 
in Wake County, N.C., is further in 
the future.

Environmental Footprint section of our 
online Sustainability Report.

Tough decision at Crystal River

After months of careful evaluation, 
Duke Energy made the difficult 
decision in February 2013 to retire the 
Crystal River Nuclear Plant. Our board 
of directors determined that retiring the 
plant is the best choice for customers, 
investors, the state of Florida and 
the company.

The 860-megawatt plant in Citrus 
County, Fla., has been out of service 
since September 2009, when a 
delamination (separation) occurred 
in the outer layer of the containment 
building’s concrete wall following steam 
generator replacement work. The 
process of repairing the damage and 
restoring the unit to service resulted 
in additional delaminations in other 
sections of the containment structure 
in 2011.

Company engineers and outside 
engineering consultants analyzed 
the feasibility and cost of repairs. 
Our options included undertaking a 
highly complex, first-of-its-kind repair, 
or retiring and decommissioning the 
plant. A report completed in late 2012 
confirmed that while the repair was 
feasible, the potential risks involved 
could raise the cost dramatically and 
extend the schedule.

The company intends to place this 
facility into a safe storage configuration,

called SAFSTOR, until dismantling 
and decontamination activities 
occur, usually in 40 to 60 years. 
Development of a comprehensive 
decommissioning plan is under way 
to determine the scope, schedule and 
resources needed.

Many of the plant’s approximately 600 
employees will remain on site through 
closing and decommissioning. The 
company is assisting other employees 
in finding new positions with 
Duke Energy.

Crystal River Nuclear Plant has been 
an important part of our diverse 
generation mix for three decades. We 
are reviewing alternatives to replace the 
power produced by the unit, including 
the potential construction of a state-of-
the-art natural gas-fueled plant. 

Water: A limited resource

Every day, Duke Energy relies on a 
significant amount of water to generate 
reliable electricity. We harness the 
power of flowing water through our 48 
conventional hydroelectric power plants 
and two pumped-storage hydroelectric 
facilities. Water is heated into steam 
to turn turbines in our fossil-fueled 
and nuclear plants, and is then cooled 
so we can recycle and use it again. 
We also use water in equipment 
that controls air emissions at our 
power plants.

When talking about water used for 
energy production, it’s important to 
differentiate between water withdrawn 
and water consumed.

Water withdrawn is the total volume 
brought into the plant from a water 
source, such as a lake or river. Often 
a large portion of this water is returned 
to the source and available to be used 
again. Water consumed is the amount 
of water removed for use and not 
returned to its source.

Water returned

98% The overall percentage of 

cooling water returned to the 
source from Duke Energy’s 
power plants

Where does the water go?
Cooling accounts for most of our water 
consumption. All electric plants that 
use steam turbines, including coal, 
natural gas, oil and nuclear, require 
cooling to condense the steam when 
it exits the turbine. 

The type and design of power plants 
affect the volume of water withdrawn 
and consumed. Two primary types of 
water-based cooling systems are used 
in electric power plants:

   Closed-loop systems recirculate 

cooling water and remove excess 
heat through a cooling tower 
or pond. Although closed-loop 
systems withdraw less water 
than once-through systems, they 
consume 30 to 40 percent more, 
through higher evaporation rates.

   Once-through cooling systems 
withdraw large quantities of 
water, but return most of it to the 
source. The primary concern with 
this design is potential harm to 
aquatic life near the plant, from the 
mechanisms used to withdraw the 
water and the higher temperature 
of the water returned.

Due to environmental concerns linked 
to once-through cooling, regulations 
for new steam-generation power 
plants require closed-loop systems. 
This in turn has greatly reduced water 
withdrawals at our newer power plants, 
but increases our consumption. We 
continuously look for ways to more 
effectively use our water resources.

Unlike issues such as climate change 
that require global solutions, water 
use must be addressed regionally and 

locally. Duke Energy continues to work 
with government, community and 
private sector partners to help manage 
this critical resource.

work to protect and conserve water 
resources, read the rest of this article

Managing coal ash responsibly

Community interest in the way our 
industry manages coal combustion 
residuals continues to be high, as 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
considers new federal rules regulating 
coal-ash storage and disposal.

More than 90 percent of coal ash is 
made of the common elements found 
in soils, such as silicon, iron, aluminum 
and calcium. Less than 1 percent is 
composed of trace elements, such as 
arsenic, selenium or mercury, that also 
exist naturally in soils. Like any other 
industrial byproduct, coal ash must be 
managed properly. 

Federal and state solid waste and 
water quality rules have governed 
coal-ash management for decades. 
Solid waste regulations dictate how 
the company handles, moves and 
stores the material, while water quality 
regulations protect surface water and 
groundwater. 

State regulators evaluate ash basin 
discharges and issue permits that 
protect the health of lakes and rivers. 
In addition to limiting the release of 
compounds restricted by the permits, 
Duke Energy measures and reports the 
amounts of many other compounds. In 
addition, we have a long-standing dam 
safety program in place that involves 
ongoing maintenance and frequent 
inspections, including those conducted 
by state regulators.

Help for planet and pocketbook

When he began working at Duke Energy two years ago, t.J. Simonik 
was intrigued by the company’s support of mass transit. He figured 
it was worth a try.

“The company makes it so easy,” said Simonik. “I’ve never been 
a bus rider. But since Duke Energy was willing to pay the cost, 
I decided to give it a try.”

He’s been hooked ever since.

Like hundreds of other employees, Simonik’s commuting costs 
are picked up by the company. In metro areas with mass transit, 
Duke Energy gives free monthly passes to enrolled employees 
using public transportation — buses, light rail or van pools. 
It’s one way the company helps employees lower their own 
environmental footprint.

Now, the Charlotte, N.C.-based senior accounting analyst catches 
up on work or reads his kindle during his daily commute. That 
beats fighting traffic, it saves him money and it’s easier on the 
environment, too. Simonik says the benefit draws attention from 
friends and fellow bus riders.

“People I know at other companies are amazed by Duke’s program,” 
he said. “It’s a great benefit, but also a great way to help the 
environment.”

Duke Energy scientists also monitor 
river and reservoir health as a whole, 
and report that data to regulators. In 
many cases, trace elements in the 
surface water are at or below the 
lowest levels laboratory instruments 
can accurately measure. 

We also monitor groundwater around 
our ash basins and report that data 
to state regulators. If we were to find 
that our operations were affecting 
the quality of neighboring drinking 
water supplies, we would work closely 
with regulators to address and resolve 
the issue.

Duke Energy has invested tens of 
millions of dollars converting from 
fly-ash storage in ponds to dry fly-ash 

handling systems with disposal in 
lined landfills at nearly all of our 
large, scrubbed coal plants. These 
newer landfills are required to have 
synthetic liners, as well as drainage 
collection systems and groundwater 
monitoring wells.

And as we retire and decommission 
older coal plants over the next several 
years, we will close coal-ash basins 
in compliance with state and federal 
regulations. We will continue to 
monitor the groundwater around those 
basins and responsibly manage those 
sites for many years.

generation capacity.

Water withdrawn and consumed
Water withdrawn is the total volume removed 
from a water source, such as a lake or a

11  These data represent the portion of our fleet that was included in the 2006 baseline, comprising approximately 90 percent of 

the pre-merger Duke Energy fleet. Operation and fuel consumption are estimated where individual mileage, engine hours or fuel 
measurements are not available. These estimates are used for emission calculations where necessary. Totals may not add up 
exactly due to rounding.

Emissions from generation
Emission levels and intensities depend on 
many factors, including generation diversity 
and efficiency, demand for electricity, 
weather, fuel availability and prices, and 
emission controls deployed. Carbon dioxide 
(CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) emissions decreased from 2011 
to 2012, due to decreased coal generation 
and increased natural gas generation. 
Duke Energy and Progress Energy have 
invested more than $7 billion in SO2 and 
NOx emission controls since 1999. As a 
result, we have reduced U.S. SO2 emissions 
by 83 percent and U.S. NOx emissions by 
64 percent since 2005. (There is currently 
no demonstrated, commercially available 
technology to control CO2 emissions.)  While 
our total CO2 emissions decreased in 2012, 
our current forecast indicates an upward 
trend in our CO2 emissions in the years ahead. 
This will challenge our ability to meet our 
2020 goal of no more than 141 million tons 
of CO2 emissions. (This goal is based on 
a 17 percent reduction from our 2005 CO2 
emission level.) 

U.S. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
Duke Energy’s TRI releases for 2011 were 
down 64 percent from 2006, primarily due 
to the significant investments we’ve made 
in environmental controls for our power 
plants. (Data for 2012 will be available in 
August 2013.)

U.S. on-road and off-road vehicle 
fleet emissions and fuel consumed
We met our goal to reduce nitrogen oxides, 
volatile organic compounds, particulate 
matter and carbon monoxide emissions 
from our on-road and off-road vehicle fleet 
by 35 percent by 2012, compared to 2006. 
During that period, we reduced emissions 
by 41 percent.

Accelerated Main 
Replacement Program
In 2000, the Accelerated Main Replacement 
Program (AMRP) was launched on 
Duke Energy’s natural gas distribution 
system in Ohio and kentucky to prevent 
leaks requiring repair and to improve safety, 
performance and reliability. The program 
accelerates the replacement of approximately 
1,400 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe, 
some in service since 1873. We exceeded our 
goal of reducing repaired leaks by 20 percent 
by 2012 compared to 2007. The AMRP is 
scheduled to be completed in 2015. Reducing 
leaks decreases the release of natural gas, 
which is mostly methane, a greenhouse gas 
approximately 20 times more potent than CO2.

Waste
We exceeded our goal to increase the 
percentage of U.S. solid waste that is 
recycled from 52 percent in 2008 to 
62 percent by 2012. A new baseline and 
goal are being developed for the merged 
company. Our Catawba, McGuire and Oconee 
nuclear stations also exceeded their goal to 
reduce by 25 percent the amount of low-level 
radioactive waste (Class B and C) they 
generated by 2012, compared to the 2002 
through 2006 average of 1,552 cubic feet.

U.S. electricity consumed
We exceeded our goal to reduce electricity 
consumption at 13 of our largest commercial 
buildings by 10 percent by 2012, compared to 
the 2005 through 2007 average.

Reportable oil spills
Oil spills include releases of lubricating 
oil from generating stations, leaks from 
transformers, or damage caused by weather 
or by third parties (typically due to auto 
accidents).

Environmental regulatory citations
No fines were associated with 12 of the 
16 citations in 2012.

Safety: Banner year still 
not good enough

The safety of our teammates and 
the public is not just a priority for 
Duke Energy — it’s one of our core 
values. That was evident in 2012, 
when the company achieved its 
lowest-ever Total Incident Case Rate 
(TICR). Combining data from the two 
merged companies, our TICR improved 
29 percent since 2009. And our 
Total Recordable Incidents were down 
25 percent from 2009, to 228, also a 
new company record.

Our improved safety record is a 
credit to the safety culture at both 
companies and our employees’ steady 
focus, especially during a period 

SAFEtY At DUKE ENERgY

of great uncertainty. However, we 
cannot — and will not — rest on our 
laurels. We have initiatives in place to 
continue driving safety performance 
improvement and consistency 
throughout the company. Our goal: 
Achieve top-decile safety performance 
among our industry peers by 2015. 

Taking action after fatalities
Although 2012 was a record-setting 
year for TICR, we failed to meet our 
most important goal: zero employee 
or contractor work-related fatalities.

In May 2012, a Pike Electric contractor 
working for Progress Energy in Elm 
City, N.C., died as a result of an 
electrical contact when a truck he

just a month later, a Progress Energy 
employee in Florida lost his life in a 
five-car accident. The employee, who 
was wearing his seatbelt, was stopped 
at a red light when a car struck his 
work vehicle from behind.

Thus far in 2013, we’ve experienced 
three fatalities, including two in our 
Duke Energy International organization. 
Early this year, a contractor in Peru 
died after making contact with an 
electrical conductor. Then, in February, 
an employee in Brazil passed away 
after the company vehicle she was 
driving ran off the road and crashed. 
Later that month, a tree-trimming 
contractor working in North Carolina 
was struck and killed by a falling 
branch. 

We took a hard look at the 
circumstances that led to each of 
those fatalities, and turned them into 
learning opportunities. For example, 
we are improving our prequalification 
process for contractors, to ensure they 
have the right training, qualifications 
and systems in place to work safely. 
By taking corrective actions, improving 
our processes, and sharing what went 
wrong with our employees, contractors 
and contracting companies, we can 
avoid similar incidents in the future.

LIVINg It:   

Weight watcher at work

Jamie wooton is less of a person than she was three years ago.

That’s no reflection on her character, or her performance as a lead 
financial analyst in Duke Energy’s Customer Services Finance group. 

It is a testament to her perseverance, and her commitment to a 
healthy lifestyle change. 

Wooton’s story is not uncommon. She began gaining weight in 
middle school, and says she was “morbidly obese” by high school. 
At one point, she weighed 350 pounds.

She joined Weight Watchers®, but wasn’t successful in keeping the 
pounds off. It took Duke Energy’s Weight Watchers @ Work program 
to motivate her to get back on track in 2010.

Since then, Wooton has lost 156 pounds — from her heaviest 
weight, she lost 170 pounds.

“The company’s support was a huge motivator,” said Wooton. 
“I also got to know other employees dealing with the same struggles. 
Reimbursement was an added bonus.” Duke Energy pays a major 
portion of Weight Watchers dues for employees who meet the 
attendance criteria.

She reached her weight loss goal in 2012, and is now a Lifetime 
member and maintaining her weight.

“Weight Watchers gave me the tools, but the biggest reason for 
my success is a change in attitude,” said Wooton. “I made my 
health a priority, and made the lifestyle changes necessary to 
reach my goal.

“I hope sharing my story will inspire others. If I can do it, you 
can do it!”

Preventing slips, trips and falls
Even in the office environment, 
employees are exposed to hazards 
that can result in slips, trips and falls. 
According to the U.S. Department of 
Labor, those are the most frequent 
causes of workplace injuries, and Duke 
Energy is no exception. Slips, trips 
and falls were the largest contributors 
to the total number of our workplace 
injuries in 2012, and also the leading 
cause of the most serious types, 
such as dislocations, fractures and 
head injuries. 

That’s why we’re focused on increasing 
employee and contractor awareness of 
the factors that can lead to slips, trips 
and falls, and on reducing exposure to 
potential risks. 

In the end, our commitment is to 
continue to reduce both the number 
and severity of injuries at Duke Energy. 

Near-miss reporting
The difference between a near-miss 
and a serious injury or fatality is often 
just a matter of inches or seconds. 
We can prevent injuries and save lives 
by reporting, collecting, sharing and 
analyzing those near-miss experiences.

Our near-miss reporting system 
provides employees and managers 
with learning opportunities before 
injuries occur, just as we learn from 
incidents that actually lead to injury 
or death. 

Based on our experience, changes in 
safety attitudes and behaviors result 
in fewer near-misses and injuries — 
and a healthier and more productive 
workforce.

Programs encourage career 
development

Employees are the lifeblood of Duke 
Energy. The company succeeds when 
they gain knowledge and expertise, 
and grow in their careers. 

Duke Energy employees own their 
career paths, and have many 
opportunities to develop their skills 
and learn new ones. Managers share 
that responsibility, and their own 
performance goals include ensuring 
their employees have growth and 
development opportunities. 

Training
Some positions require formal training 
on the job. Nuclear reactor operators, 
for example, get simulator training one 
out of every five weeks throughout 
their careers. In addition to formalized 
instruction, the company offers:

   Apprenticeships and mentoring 

programs

   Computer-based training on office 
skills, electrical safety, business 
ethics and many job-specific topics

   Classroom training in conflict 

management, business writing, 
project management and leadership 
skills, to name just a few

   A continuing education program, 

which provides financial assistance 
for courses, degree programs 
and exams

   Sponsorship of employee chapters 

of Toastmasters, Women in Nuclear, 
Young Generation in Nuclear and 
the American Association of Blacks 
in Energy

   Rotational assignments, which 
provide employees with diverse 
experiences across the company.

Mature workforce

51.5% Percentage of employees

Employee Resource Groups
The company also encourages 
participation in employee resource 
groups — networks of employees with 
common interests or experiences. All 
employees are welcome to join any 
resource group:

   Advocates for African-Americans (A3) 
   Business Women’s Network (BWN)
   disABILITY Outreach & Inclusion 

Team (DO-IT!)

   Latinos Energizing Diversity @

   New 2 Duke (N2D).

Aging workforce
Well over half of our current workforce 
is made up of “baby boomers” 
and “traditionalists,” who will be 
considering retirement in the next 
decade or so. 

Our workforce planning groups 
monitor the company’s demographics, 
forecasting areas in which the 
company will need to recruit new hires, 
based on changes in demographics 
and required skills.

Community outreach
To prepare future generations to 
replace our aging workforce, Duke 
Energy partners with community 
colleges and universities to provide 
the training and education required 
for today’s energy careers.

The company reaches out to younger 
students as well, to pique their interest 
in engineering, science and other 
energy-related disciplines. 

For example, Duke Energy is a 
major sponsor of the N.C. Science 
Festival, led by the University of North 
Carolina’s Morehead Planetarium and 
Science Center. The annual festival 
highlights the educational, cultural and 
financial impact of science in the state, 
and encourages students to pursue 
careers in science and technology.

One size does not fit all in the world 
of employee engagement. This is 
especially true in companies as 
large and geographically diverse as 
Duke Energy. Recognizing this, we 
took a new approach to our grassroots 
employee sustainability network 
in 2012.

The Sustainability Corps provides a 
way for like-minded employees to get 
connected, trained and empowered. 
All Corps members attend a day-long

DUkE ENERGy 2012 SUSTAINABILITy REPORT

240 members have been delivering 
tangible benefits to the company, 
including reduced costs and 
environmental impacts. 

But despite its early success, the Corps 
lacked significant participation from 
front-line employees working in field 
locations, such as power plants. To 
address this gap, the Sustainability 
Corps hit the road in 2012. 

A pilot program brought the workshops 
to the field and customized the 
experience for three targeted work 
groups: distribution system engineers 
in South Carolina, coal plant operators 
in the Midwest and warehouse 
operations personnel throughout our 
regulated service territories. 

The results are encouraging. More 
than 50 field employees participated in 
customized workshops, learned about 
sustainability and tackled 13 separate 
projects. Besides expanding the 
network to more employees, we found 
that the targeted approach engaged 
local managers and gave work teams 
a forum to discuss sustainability issues 
relevant to them. 

The success of the pilot reinforces 
the importance of pushing employee 
education and engagement beyond 
the corporate walls. The Sustainability 
Corps intends to stay on the road in 
2013 and continue to build a culture of 
sustainability throughout the company, 
regardless of location.

Economic development: 
It’s a team sport

We know that what benefits our 
customers benefits our company. But 
the reverse is also true — access to 
Duke Energy’s low-cost, reliable power 
helps our business customers succeed. 
Through our economic development 
efforts, we team up with state, regional 
and local government leaders to attract 
new companies, jobs and capital 
investment to the areas we serve. 

This work has become even more 
important in light of the weak economy 
and increasing competition among 
regions to attract business growth. 
In 2012, Duke Energy helped attract 
more than $3.5 billion in investments 
in new and expanded businesses in 
our service areas, and approximately 
13,000 jobs. 

Not on the sidelines
Duke Energy’s game-day approach to 
economic development is unique in 
the utility industry. Our enterprisewide 
team identifies and proactively recruits 
large national and international 
companies to our service areas. 

The Site Readiness Program is a 
key part of Duke Energy’s economic 
development playbook. The program 
identifies, evaluates, improves and 

increases awareness of industrial sites 
in the company’s service territories. 
And that helps our communities 
compete for new industry and jobs, 
and diversify their economies. 

support includes funding from the 
Duke Energy and Progress Energy 
Foundations, company donations, 
employee and retiree gifts, and the 
value of volunteer hours. 

This winning approach to economic 
development is receiving national 
attention. In 2012, for a record 
14th year, Site Selection magazine 
recognized Duke Energy as one 
of the top 10 utility companies in 
promoting economic development. 
The magazine also ranked all six retail-
customer states Duke Energy serves 
in the top 12 states in the U.S. for 
business climate.

economic development teams in the 
Carolinas, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky

Volunteering is in her blood

Volunteering has been a big part of Edie webb’s life for more 
than 20 years. This Raleigh employee takes time to serve her 
community through the Raleigh Rescue Mission, Shepherd’s Table 
Soup kitchen, Special Olympics, BackPack Buddies (a group that 
provides healthy meals to needy children on weekends), the Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dorothea Dix Hospital and 
Meals on Wheels. 

And when her son’s Boy Scout troop needed someone to lead 
popcorn sales, guess who stepped up?

“Not only does it make me feel good, but it also keeps me from 
taking things for granted,” Webb says. “I want my sons to learn 

the importance of volunteerism and hope it will be a lifelong 
commitment for them as well.”

Giving time is one thing — giving blood is another. But Webb has 
turned her fear of needles into a personal challenge. She is donating 
blood four times this year, and leading the Red Cross blood drive for 
Duke Energy Progress employees in downtown Raleigh.

Webb, a project manager in Corporate Communications, finds many 
of her volunteer opportunities through the company. “Volunteering 
with friends makes the experience even better,” she says.

She adds, “I will only work for a company that I respect, both in 
terms of integrity and community involvement.”

Employee support
In addition to funding by focus area, 
the Foundations gave $4.7 million 
to support employee giving in 2012, 
including:

   Matching gifts for employee and 
retiree donations to qualifying 
nonprofit organizations

   Duke Energy’s United Way and 
community arts campaigns, and 
Progress Energy’s “Give Where 
You Live” campaign

   Grants to support employee and 

retiree volunteer efforts. 

The Duke Energy Foundation offers 
two types of volunteer grants: 

   Community improvement grants, 
used to purchase supplies for 
“sweat equity” volunteer projects

   Leadership grants for employees 
who serve on nonprofit boards.

Help with energy bills
Our energy assistance programs help 
those in need cope with extreme heat 
and cold. In 2012:

   In the Midwest, the company 

contributed $1.27 million to three 
programs to assist low-income 
customers with winter heating bills 
— HeatShare in Ohio, WinterCare 
in Kentucky and Helping Hand 
in Indiana, which also assists the 
elderly and disabled.

   In the Carolinas, The Duke Energy 
Foundation contributed $810,000 
to similar programs. Share the 
Warmth helps low-income families 
with winter heating bills, Cooling 
Assistance assists handicapped, 
elderly and low-income customers 
with summertime energy costs, and 
Fan-Heat Relief provides free fans 
to help senior citizens cope with 
sweltering summer heat.

Lasting impact
Both companies have laid the 
foundation for a sustainable impact on 
our communities. That’s a legacy we 
intend to build on, as we continue to 
support the communities we serve.

‘Sweat equity’ strengthens 
communities

Both Duke Energy and Progress 
Energy have a long history of employee 
involvement in our communities. 
As one company, now the largest 
investor-owned utility in the U.S., 
we are building on that commitment, 
to reflect the size and strength of the 
new Duke Energy.

Annual volunteer events have 
highlighted the importance of 
community involvement at both 
companies. At legacy Duke Energy, 

employees, retirees and their friends 
and families rolled up their sleeves 
to support hundreds of community 
projects during the company’s 2012 
Global Service Event. At Progress 
Energy, individual departments 
selected and supported nonprofit 
agencies for an annual Day of Caring. 

Of course, employees also volunteer 
in their communities year-round. We 
track their community involvement 
through our online volunteer system, 
which also allows employees to create, 
submit and sign up for projects, and 
apply for supporting grants. 

The newly combined company is 
bringing together these best practices 
in volunteerism and looking at ways to 
better support employees’ hands-on 
involvement in their communities. For 
example, enhancements to the online 
volunteer system will make it easier for 
employees to select community service 
projects and form volunteer teams. 

As our organization and systems 
continue to change, so will our 
communities’ needs. But one thing 
will not change.

Our longstanding tradition of 
encouraging employees to make 
a difference in people’s lives will 
remain part of our mission — 
to promote the health and success 
of our communities.

Empowering women 
to be entrepreneurs

We’re working to narrow the gender 
gap in Latin America by helping 
women become powerful forces in 
their local communities. Duke Energy 
International bases its Emprendedoras 
del Sur (Women Entrepreneurs of 
the South) program on our belief that 
economically self-sufficient women 
spark thriving communities. 

It began in San José de Chilca, Peru, 
in 2011 and expanded to other 
regions in Peru, including Ancash 
and Ucayali, in 2012. We are also 
planning to spread the program to 
women in other Latin American 
countries where we operate. 

The program teaches basics, such as 
how to write a business plan, and then 
trains women to manage and market 
their own small enterprises. Technical 
support helps ensure they have access 
to, and training on, the latest essential 
business tools. 

The women entrepreneurs operate 
businesses that range from bakeries 
and hardware stores to child-care 
facilities and food stores.

The goal is to help women follow 
their dreams and build sustainable 
businesses. When women have the 
know-how to boost their incomes, they 
can improve their families’ lives and 
make their communities stronger.

Financial strength supports 
sustainable growth

In 2012, the company achieved 
adjusted diluted earnings per share of 
$4.32, which was near the top of the 
company’s $4.20 to $4.35 earnings 
guidance to Wall Street.

Those strong financial results reflect 
the addition of earnings from Progress 
Energy since our merger in July 2012, 
and rate increases at Duke Energy 
Carolinas to recover our investments in 
cleaner power plants and digital power 
delivery systems. 

Delivering competitive returns for our 
investors is one of our primary goals 
as a sustainable company. Toward 
that aim, we increased our quarterly 
dividend by approximately 2 percent 
in 2012, the 86th consecutive year 
Duke Energy has paid a quarterly 
dividend on its common stock. 

Our total shareholder return — the 
change in stock price plus dividends 
— from the merger announcement in 
early January 2011 through the end of 
2012 was approximately 32 percent. 
This significantly outperformed 
the 17 percent return of both the 
Philadelphia Utility Index (20 U.S. 
utilities) and the S&P 500 during 
the same period.

The strength of our balance sheet, 
liquidity and investment-grade credit 

support our ability to grow the business 
as well as the dividend. We are 
committed to maintaining this financial 
strength, which allows us to grow in 
a sustainable, cost-effective manner. 
During 2012, we continued to take 
advantage of historically low long-term 
interest rates and issued $4.6 billion 
of fixed-rate debt at a weighted-average 
rate of 3.2 percent, with a weighted-
average term of 17 years.

In 2012, the company spent 
approximately $6 billion on 
capital, investment and acquisition 
expenditures, and we expect that to be 
fairly consistent in 2013. We continue 
to hold discretionary capital, which 
gives us the flexibility to pursue future 
projects that meet our growth criteria. 

Duke Energy remains well-positioned 
to achieve long-term average annual 
growth in adjusted diluted earnings 
per share of 4 to 6 percent from a 
2013 base, which represents the 
first full year for the merged company, 
through 2015.

Performance Excellence: 
Doing business better

Even the very best companies have 
room for improvement. That’s the 
idea behind Performance Excellence, 
Duke Energy’s continuous improve-
ment discipline.

— resulting in increased efficiency, 
reduced costs and ultimately better 
business results. 

Performance Excellence stems from the 
Lean Six Sigma body of knowledge —  
a set of principles, tools and techniques 
for improving the operating performance 
of any business. 

During 2012, Duke Energy refined and 
adapted Lean Six Sigma thinking to the 
newly combined company’s mission, 
values and priorities, including achieve-
ment of our merger commitments.

Combining continuous improvement 
practices from both companies, we set 
out to improve safety and operational 
performance, enhance employee 
productivity and engagement, 
manage rising costs and increase 
customer satisfaction. 

That work continues in 2013, with 
formal training programs under 
way, and improvement plans being 
developed and put into practice 
throughout the company.

Supply Chain combines best 
practices of both companies

The merger of Duke Energy and 
Progress Energy has provided oppor-
tunities to consolidate and renegotiate 
contracts to save money, adopt best 
practices and develop new capabilities 
in supply chain management. 

For our combined U.S. operations, we 
now have more than 20,000 suppliers 
of non-fuel materials and services, 
mostly from domestic sources, and 
spend approximately $9 billion 
annually. That includes spending on 
major projects to modernize our fleet, 
reduce air emissions and maintain 
system reliability. About half of the 
annual spend is on materials — the 
other half on services.

Opening doors for small business

April harley is passionate about supporting small and diverse businesses. As supplier 
diversity and business development specialist in St. Petersburg, Fla., she has what it 
takes to help small and diverse enterprises succeed as suppliers.

“We do not give away contracts,” Harley says. “Supplier diversity opens the door.”  

And once that door is open, suppliers find an expert resource in Harley. She leads workshops, 
roundtables and site visits so new suppliers have an understanding of the utility industry.  

“Educating suppliers about our business is vital,” says Harley. “Our unique needs, from 
power plant operations to vegetation management, can be difficult for small or minority-
owned businesses to navigate.” 

She helped coordinate outreach and vendor fairs with local suppliers in North Florida that 
led to approximately $500,000 in contracts for small and minority-owned businesses in 
Madison County and four economically challenged counties nearby.   

Harley’s work earned recognition as Supplier Diversity Advocate of the year in 2012 from 
the Central North Florida Minority Supplier Development Council. 

To Harley, it’s more than a job — it’s a commitment to the future of small business: 
“I want my children and the next generation to know that if you have a drive to build a 
small business, there will be opportunities as long as you put in the necessary work.”

Many of Duke Energy’s large suppliers 
are well-established companies that 
share our commitment to sustainability. 
About 75 percent of our annual 
spending is with our top 250 suppliers. 

Learn how we are strengthening 
relationships with our suppliers, 
partnering with innovative vendors 
and using a total-cost-of-ownership 
approach to make our supply chain 
more sustainable. See the rest of

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share 
Duke Energy’s 2012 adjusted earnings were $2,483 million and adjusted diluted earnings per 
share (EPS) were $4.32. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP (generally 
accepted accounting principles) financial measure, as it represents income from continuing 
operations after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for the dollar 
and per-share impact of special items and the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges 
in the Commercial Power segment. Special items represent certain charges and credits which 
management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible 
such charges and credits could recur. Mark-to-market adjustments reflect the mark-to-market 
impact of derivative contracts, which is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately as such 
derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory accounting, used in 
Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the economic value of certain of its generation assets 
in the Commercial Power segment. The economic value of the generation assets is subject to 
fluctuations in the fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities 
(e.g., coal, power) and, as such, the economic hedging involves both purchase and sales of 
those input and output commodities related to the generation assets. Because the operations 
of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method, management believes 
that excluding the impact of mark-to-market changes of the economic hedge contracts from 
adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the hedge contract 
with the portion of the economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes that 
the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides an additional relevant 
comparison of the company’s performance across periods. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted 
EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses.

The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS 
is net income and diluted EPS attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common shareholders, 
which includes the dollar and per-share impact of special items, the mark-to-market impacts of 
economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and discontinued operations. The table at 
right is a reconciliation of net income and diluted EPS to adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted 
EPS for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Duke Energy’s forecasted 2013 adjusted diluted EPS outlook range is $4.20 to $4.45 per share, 
which is consistent with the 2013 employee incentive earnings target. Duke Energy’s long-term 
targeted range of growth is 4 percent to 6 percent in adjusted diluted EPS (on a compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) basis). Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure 
for future periods, information to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project special items or 
mark-to-market adjustments to future periods.

threats and other catastrophic events; the inherent risks associated with the operation and 
potential construction of nuclear facilities, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and 
financial risks; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign 
currency exchange rates and the ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process, 
where appropriate; unscheduled generation outages, unusual maintenance or repairs and 
electric transmission system constraints; the performance of electric generation facilities and of 
projects undertaken by Duke Energy’s nonregulated businesses; the results of financing efforts, 
including the ability of Duke Energy and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms, 
which can be affected by various factors, including Duke Energy’s credit ratings and general 
economic conditions; declines in the market prices of equity securities and resultant cash funding 
requirements for Duke Energy’s defined benefit pension plans and nuclear decommissioning trust 
funds; the level of creditworthiness of counterparties to the transactions of Duke Energy and its 
subsidiaries; employee workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain 
key personnel; growth in opportunities for Duke Energy’s business units, including the timing and 
success of efforts to develop domestic and international power and other projects; construction 
and development risks associated with the completion of the capital investment projects of Duke 
Energy’s subsidiaries in existing and new generation facilities, including risks related to financing, 
obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules, and 
satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover 
costs, from ratepayers in a timely manner or at all; the ability of Duke Energy’s subsidiaries to

identified and discussed in Duke Energy’s reports filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s 
website at sec.gov. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described 
in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a 
different time than Duke Energy has described. Duke Energy undertakes no obligation to publicly 
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
