legislation, supports the construction and 

operation of up to 300 MW of utility-scale 

solar and 150 MW of battery energy storage 

at nine coal plant sites across the state. This 

type of thoughtful renewable transition 

not only helps to mitigate climate change, 

but it also bolsters the economy through

Vistra’s Strategy

Electricity is the lifeblood of society and 

the demand for this essential resource 

is growing as we electrify the economy. 

As this country simultaneously navigates 

the energy transition and increasing 

demand, we all have an obligation to 
balance affordability, reliability, and the 
environment. If any one of these critical 
factors outweighs the others, we risk 

adverse consequences.

Decarbonization Goals

To minimize the environmental impact 

of our business activities, Vistra has set 

aggressive but achievable emissions 

reduction targets.

Further, Vistra is among 

a thousand companies 

worldwide leading the 

zero-carbon transition 

U.S. power producers have substantially 

reduced carbon emissions through market 

forces, all while maintaining reliability and 

ensuring people can afford the electricity 

that fuels their lives. Vistra, as one of the 

largest electricity generators in the U.S., 

has led the way in these efforts and is 

committed to addressing climate change, 

by committing to set emissions reduction 

targets grounded in climate science 

through the Science Based Targets initiative 

(SBTi). By joining SBTi’s Business Ambition 

for 1.5°C, we aim to align our emissions 

reduction targets with the Paris Agreement 

to keep warming to 1.5°C and reach science-

based net-zero emissions by 2050.

Portfolio Transformation

A primary element of Vistra’s long-

term business strategy is growth and 

transformation. We expect to responsibly 

transition our generation portfolio to low-

to-no carbon generation sources through 

retirements of fossil-fueled assets and 

investments in renewables, battery energy 

storage, and carbon-reducing technologies.

Coal Transition
Since 2010, Vistra has retired more than 

12,000 MW of coal and gas plants, resulting 
in a 43% reduction of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. Another eight coal-fueled 

power plants across Illinois, Ohio, and Texas 

are set to retire no later than 2027, totaling 

another ~7,500 MW.

Repurposing these former fossil-

fueled plant sites into renewable and 

energy storage facilities is important to 

Vistra’s transformation strategy. With 

interconnection infrastructure already 

available, these sites provide the company 

a strategic advantage to quickly develop 

new zero-carbon facilities. More importantly, 

repurposing sites allows us to continue 

supporting the local plant communities and 
our employees in those areas — an active 
pursuit of a just transition.

We acknowledge that we have not provided 

retirement details on two coal-fueled plants, 

both located in Texas. Vistra will continue 

to evaluate these two assets based on 

economics, environmental impact, and 

reliability of the ERCOT electric grid. 

Pursuing a Just Transition
The most difficult decisions we make in our business are ones that impact 

our people and our plant communities. Though power plant retirement 

decisions are never easy, Vistra strives to provide a just transition, working 

to minimize the social and economic impacts of closures.

Vistra Zero

Vistra has established a leading role in 

the energy transition with the planned 

growth of Vistra Zero, our zero-carbon 

generation portfolio. With a robust pipeline 

of development projects, Vistra expects 
to have at least 7,300 MW of zero-carbon 
generation online by 2026 in the key states 
of Texas, California, and Illinois.

To continue to grow our Vistra Zero portfolio, 

which already includes ~2,900 MW of zero-

energy storage 

at nine retired 

or to be-retired 

coal plant sites 

across central and southern Illinois. The 

initiative also includes diverse suppliers 

while bringing a much-needed 

property tax base to local communities.

 • Completed three projects in Texas, prior 

carbon generation online, we have:

ESG Governance & Oversight

Board of Directors
The full Vistra board oversees ESG with 

oversight of subject matter-specific 

components delegated to relevant board 

committees, as reflected in the diagram.

ESG-related topics are discussed at each 

scheduled quarterly board and committee 

meeting and on a more frequent basis 

as necessary. In addition, the full board 

has direct oversight and responsibility of 

cybersecurity risk and Vistra’s lobbying and 

political contributions. 

The full board also focuses on our long-

term sustainability and decarbonization 

strategy, taking an active role to oversee 

the development and execution of Vistra’s 

long-term corporate strategy. The board 

regularly reviews climate-related risks and 

opportunities — including the transformation 

of our generation portfolio and investments 

in zero-carbon resources — given their 

significance to and interconnectedness with 

capital deployment, business strategy, and 

other board decisions.

Vistra is led by a team of industry veterans 

with expertise across all areas of the energy 

and retail businesses, and each director 

brings ESG experience through climate 

change and sustainable strategy/policy 

experience, human capital management/
DEI experience, or both (as detailed in our 
2022 proxy statement). The extensive mix of 
skills, knowledge, and experience the board 

brings is a direct result of the diversity of our 

board members.

To ensure the board and senior 

consultants and experts, including, for 

management stay current on climate

Water

The use of water is imperative to producing 

Water Withdrawn and Discharged

electricity from thermal generation. 

Vistra understands that water is a limited, 

expensive, and shared resource that is 

essential to life. Recognizing the value of 

water resources, conservation is a focus at 

each of our generation facilities, especially in 

areas considered “high stress” or “extremely 

high stress.” We incorporate the risk of 

water scarcity into Vistra’s corporate risk 

management process, along with other 

environmental and climate-related risks.

Across our power plants, Vistra practices 

good stewardship and uses water efficiently 

though management of water is site 

specific. Each facility manages its daily water 

withdrawal, consumption, and discharge 

in accordance with local, state, and federal 

permits and regulations that control water 

use and effluent quality. Where appropriate, 

we built large reservoirs to capture water 

due to significant business development 

and population growth in the state. Each 

of these highly efficient natural gas plants 

utilize low water demand and have their 

own site-specific conservation measures, 

including: 

 9 Operating as a zero-discharge facility
 9 Using reclaimed water as its primary 

when it is plentiful, allowing it to be reused/

source

recycled repeatedly. We also find ways to 

recycle water, to reuse water from one 

 9 Utilizing low-quality water with 
significant treatment to recycle 

system to another system to reduce our use 

extensively

of freshwater, and to reclaim other types of 
wastewaters, when feasible. In fact, Vistra 
power plants consume less than 2% of 

water withdrawn.

Vistra has five efficient natural gas-fueled 

power plants in areas identified as “High 

Stress” or “Extremely High Stress”. Each 

of these plants are located in regions 

of Texas that are either typically arid, 

historically susceptible to drought, and/or 

experiencing higher electricity demands 

Vistra is a key player in helping manage 

national water resources and providing 

expertise on several official regional 

and statewide water planning, water 

conservation, and flood planning groups 

or committees. Each year, we report our 

water use and conservation activities in our 

responses to various states’ Water Survey/

Inventory Programs, and we carefully 

monitor the quality and impact of any water 

we return to the waterways.

Waste 

Vistra's facilities minimize the amount of 

waste produced at each of our locations. This 

includes limiting the amount of inventory 

of ancillary chemicals at each location and 

ensuring that all product procured is utilized. 

Wastes such as metals, universal waste, and 

used oils are recycled to the extent feasible at 

an average rate of 90%. All waste generated 

at each site is appropriately collected, 

contained, and transferred to offsite facilities 

in accordance with all local and federal 

regulations.

in products

 • Over $71 million in 
revenue for Vistra

 • Reduces carbon 

use—each ton of fly ash used in place of traditional 

cement, results in a reduction of about one ton of 

carbon dioxide 

As required for compliance with the U.S. EPA 

standards, information on our coal combustion residual 
impoundments can be found on Luminant’s website.

Radioactive Waste 

Vistra manages low-level radioactive waste and spent 

nuclear fuel (SNF) safely, securely, and responsibly in 

accordance with all state and federal regulations.

Most radioactive waste generated by nuclear power 

plants is low radioactivity material that is processed into 

a solid state before being placed in specially designed, 

robust containers for storage and disposal. 

Higher radioactive material content waste, classified as 

Class B and C wastes, accounts for ~10% of the average 

9,000 cubic feet of waste generated at our facility. 

Since 2018, Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant 

has shipped its waste to a qualified disposal facility in 

Andrews, Texas.  

SNF is stored on-site at all U.S. nuclear facilities. We 

safely store SNF from our nuclear generating facility 

on-site in storage pools and dry cask long-term storage 

facilities. We have enough capacity to safely store our 

SNF through the extended life of our plant through 

decommissioning.   

Other Hazardous Waste 

Recycling Program

The amount of hazardous waste generated at our 

29 tons of waste recycled

Governance of DEI

Recognizing the importance of creating 
a diverse, equal, and inclusive culture, 
Vistra established oversight of DEI by the 
Social Responsibility and Compensation 
Committee of the board of directors with 
day-to-day management of programs 
performed by the Chief Diversity Officer.  
As DEI should be central to the company’s 

culture, Vistra also maintains an employee-
led DEI Advisory Council to play an active role 
in the design and implementation of Vistra’s 
DEI program.

The progress and results of our DEI program 
can be summarized in four focus categories 
as listed below, and discussed in the 
following pages: 

Employee Engagement
While creating a diverse and inclusive 
workplace was always a focus of Vistra, it was 
brought to the forefront in 2020. Throughout 
2020, senior management held nearly 30 
internal listening sessions to hear employees’ 
thoughts and experiences on race in their 
lives and within the workplace. The feedback 
from these sessions launched many new DEI 
programs. Vistra has expanded the listening 

sessions, conducting new sessions multiple 
times a year to focus on different employee 
groups and hear their stories: women, Asian 
Americans, new employees, and more. Our 
people are our number one priority, and 
these listening sessions have helped create a 
culture of open feedback, allowing leadership 
to get direct insights into the employee 
experience to make informed decisions.

Hazard Management
Vistra relies on the Center of Excellence 

Emergency Preparedness
Vistra provides a comprehensive and 

(COE) groups, such as the Hazard 

integrated emergency management 

Management COE, to provide standards 

system that coordinates on- and off-site 

to manage the hazards associated with 

resources to protect lives, property, and the 

our industry. The goal is to provide safe 

environment through education, training, 

working environments and establish our 

assessment, preparedness, response, and 

Best Defense. The standards created by 

mitigation from all hazards that may impact 

these COE groups will provide current 

our company and community.

To hone our emergency preparedness, we:

1. 

Identify the potential emergencies  

that may occur,

2.  Create emergency action plans,

3.  Clearly define and communicate  

expectations, roles, and  

responsibilities,

4.  Identify the equipment, facilities,  

and personnel needed for  

response, and

5.  Continuously conduct drills and  

exercises to stay ready.

and updated procedures, practices, and 

guidance documents. This will ensure all 

sites have the tools to stay in compliance 

with current regulations, share best 

practices, and have access to audit and 

review guidelines.

Vistra utilizes Pre- and Post-Job Briefs as 

the main tools for hazard assessments. The 

Pre-Job Brief is one of the most effective HPI 

tools available for reducing significant injuries 

and fatalities. An effective Pre-Job Brief 

ensures workers and supervisors understand 

the scope of work to be performed so they 

can identify the hazards and related safety 

precautions associated with “this team on 

this task at this time.” The purpose of the 

Post-Job Review is to identify potential 

safety improvements. Once the areas of 

improvement are identified, changes to 

task resources and procedures can be 

incorporated appropriately for future tasks.

AUDITS

Vistra conducts regular audits and assessments at each 

location to measure the level of compliance with the Safety 

Management System and standards. These audits identify 

gaps or systemic issues and assist the organization and sites 

with addressing them. Vistra’s corporate compliance team 

conducts quarterly reviews on corporate safety and health 

policy, management systems, standards, guidelines, and 

processes to ensure they continue to reflect sound practices 

and meet the company’s high standards.

arranges for end-of-life treatment such 

as equipment replacement or recycling. 

For our energy storage projects, batteries 

are sourced from several manufacturers 

who can provide detailed sourcing and 

tracking methods of the ultimate product 

procured. For example, batteries procured 

from LG Chem or Samsung have complete 

traceability back to the mine in which the 

raw materials were produced, the batch 

mixing completed, who the operators were, 

and the ultimate production date including 

all testing and quality assurance reports. 

In addition, our battery procurement 

also contemplates and arranges for 

recycling and sets minimum standards 

for recyclability. Currently, over 95% of an 
energy storage battery can be recycled.

Solar panels have a similar procurement 

process. When Vistra issues a request 

for proposal and commits to a panel 

manufacturer, strict adherence to 

traceability is required and obtained 

from the manufacturer. Given that most 

components within a solar panel can be 

recycled, we are able to meet our objectives 

on responsible sourcing. Together with 

Supply Chain Risk Management
Risk assessment and management 

within Vistra’s supply chain are performed 

independently by individual sourcing and 

category managers based on the supplier. 

In 2021, we engaged a third party to 

evaluate our top 400 suppliers for Adverse 

Media Impact and Financial Risk. Vistra 

has identified 94 Critical Tier 1 Suppliers 

reflecting all categories under supply chain 

management: IT, Shared Services, and Fossil 

and Nuclear Generation. Vistra continues to 

evaluate suppliers based on our Risk Matrix, 

including the following attributes with 

multiple subcategories: 

1. Technology 

2. Sustainability — Political Sensitivity 

3. Continuity 

4. Financial Stability 

5. Industry Risk. 

SUPPLY CHAIN LEADERSHIP DURING WINTER STORM URI

In February 2021, Texas was hit with the unprecedented Winter 

Storm Uri. During this time, Vistra’s sole focus was to continue to 

provide reliable, affordable and safe power to the citizens of Texas.  

Vistra produced up to 30% of the power on the grid during the 

storm (compared to ~18% in normal operations). 

Supply Chain collaborated with our community affairs team, who 
worked with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to 

clear the rural roadways to our power plants. Vistra then utilized 

one of our Veteran Business Enterprises, Gallantry Logistics, to 

deliver heaters and other critical products. 

In addition, when the need for supplemental fuel arose, Vistra 

obtained the needed supply from three of our diverse suppliers, 

Texas-based Women Business Enterprises, Ricochet Fuel and 

Suncoast and Hightower’s Petroleum, a certified Minority Business 

Enterprise, based in Ohio. Together they delivered a combined 

~3,210,000 gallons of diesel. 

Vistra also partnered with a Houston-based Minority Business 

Enterprise, Clear Choice, to obtain ~55,000 pounds of a sustainable, 

environmentally friendly de-icer to two of Vistra’s power plants

Vistra’s goal is to achieve a 60% reduction in CO2e emissions by 2030, as compared to a 2010 baseline, and 
net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, assuming necessary advancements in technology and supportive market 
constructs and public policy. We expect progress towards these goals will include incremental thermal asset 
retirements, continued investment in solar and battery energy storage, and the monitoring and potential 
deployment of new technologies. As of Dec. 31, 2021, Vistra reduced its CO2e emissions by 43% compared to 
a 2010 baseline—achieving nearly 72% of Vistra’s 2030 emissions reduction goal. Emissions slightly increased 
from 2020 due primarily to more generation in 2021 than in 2020 which experienced lower demand due to 
COVID-19.

(continued)

IF-EU-140a.3

Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and 
practices to mitigate those risks

Water is a limited, expensive, and shared resource that is essential to Vistra’s power plant operations. Producing 
electricity utilizes water in several key functions such as producing steam, condensing steam, cooling equip-
ment, pollution control equipment and in some circumstances, boiler make-up, potable water, cleaning and 
other uses. Therefore, water conservation is a primary concern at each of our generating facilities, especially 
those in high water stress areas. The risk and management of water is reviewed as part of Vistra’s corporate risk 
management process, along with other environmental and climate-related risks. Further, water scracity from 
droughts was reveiwed as part of Vistra’s climate scenario analysis among various climate projections over the 
next 30 years.

Though many of our power plants are geographically situated in an area of ample water supply, Vistra practices 
environmental stewardship and works to efficiently use water at all locations. Each facility manages its daily 
water withrdrawl, consumption, and discharge in accordance with local, state and federal permits and regula-
tions that control water use and effluent quality. Where appropriate, we have built large reservoirs to capture 
water when it is plentiful, allowing it to be reused/recycled repeatedly. When feasible, we find ways to recycle 
water, to reuse water from one system to another system to reduce our use of freshwater, and to reclaim other 
types of wastewaters. In fact, Vistra power plants consume less than 2% of water withdrawn.

Vistra has five efficient natural gas fueled power plants in areas identified as “High Stress” or “Extremely High 
Stress” in Texas. They are located in regions of the state that are either typically arid, historically susceptible 
to drought, and/or experiencing higher electricity demands due to significant business development and 
population growth in the state. Each of these highly efficient natural gas plants utilize low water demand and 
have their own site-specific conservation measures: Two have extremely low water demand, one operates as a 
zero discharge facility, another uses reclaimed water as its primary source, and the last one utilizes low quality 
water with significant treatment, is able to recycle extensively, and then discharges to a facility that continues 
to recycle the same water.

Tax governance, control, and risk management

Vistra operates in a complex environment, across many jurisdictions. Our businesses are subject to federal, state and local 
taxation regimes in the United States, and, on a smaller scale, internationally. Conducting our daily activities within the laws, reg-
ulations and rules is not an option we choose, but rather the way we do business that is ingrained in our culture. Our tax function 
is built in the bedrock of this principle, as we are committed to ensuring tax issues are handled with integrity and compliance in 
all jurisdictions we serve.  
Vistra is committed to providing excellence in our operations, while maintaining an efficient cost structure.  Tax can be a very 
large recurring expense to any business operation. Vistra’s Tax department ensures Vistra operates with an efficient tax structure 
and regularly implements process and operating improvements to ensure our cost structure is optimized. Vistra Tax evaluates 
many opportunities to validly reduce its taxes, for example, by claiming available tax credits or eliminating entities in the structure 
that are no longer being used by the business operations, thereby reducing compliance costs. In evaluating these opportunities, 
however, Vistra Tax is anchored by our approach to taking highly certain tax positions.   
There are times when Vistra Tax records uncertain tax positions. These situations are largely limited to occasions where (i) Vistra 
acquires a business that has such positions recorded on their books, so they are inherited positions, or (ii) in rare circumstances, 
guidance from regulators is at odds with the laws issued by Congress. In all cases, where an uncertain tax position may exist, 
it is recorded and disclosed as required under the Internal Revenue Code and GAAP guidelines. We take a balanced approach 
towards audit of any of our tax positions. Our dealings with federal, state and local auditors, where applicable, are honest, pro-
ductive and forthright, while also striving to achieve the full value of our enterprise for our investors. 
Similarly, we are very aware that the taxes we pay to do business in various jurisdictions has a direct impact on the communities 
we serve. To that end, at times, we may pay more than our fair share because it is the right thing to do in that particular commu-
nity. Examples of this can be found in various property tax jurisdictions, where certain of our businesses have been discontinued. 
Many times, we work with the local jurisdictions to step-down the property tax payments over time and provide other community 
support to provide such communities the time needed to supplement the lost tax revenue. 
As explained above, Vistra is guided by the principle of integrity. Tax operations are no different.  Unethical or unlawful behavior 
is absolutely not tolerated. Employees exhibiting such behaviors are terminated immediately. Vistra’s tax department is reminded 
regularly by the general tax counsel of our guiding principles when evaluating tax positions, reporting and preparing tax filings, 
and when reviewing public disclosures. 
The reporting structure of the Vistra Tax department ensures that our goals and principles are held to the highest standards. 
Several backstops provide this certainty.  First, within the department you will find a diverse group of highly experienced tax 
professionals from a wide variety of backgrounds, which we believe promotes productivity, creativity, and our ability to attract 
and retain the best tax talent.  Second, Vistra’s Tax department reports to the CFO, who hosts meetings across the finance 
department at least weekly to ensure all functional business groups are operating cohesively and transparently. Third, our general 
tax counsel is a member of the Compliance Leadership Team, organized by Vistra’s general counsel and chief compliance officer. 
The Compliance Leadership Team also meets regularly to discuss audit metrics throughout Vistra, which in turn are reported to 
and reviewed by the Audit Committee. Our general tax counsel is also a member of Vistra’s Management Committee, which as 
discussed above, provides an opportunity for significant tax issues to be discussed and strategized at the highest levels of the 
company. Additionally, tax expenses are subject to review and approval by the Commitments Committee, also described above. 
This ensures that no tax expense/payment outside of the approved long-range plan can be submitted without discussion and 
approval by the highest officers of our company. Finally, Vistra’s general tax counsel presents all major tax transactions and stan-
dard tax metrics to the board’s Audit Committee quarterly.

Waste directed to disposal

Vistra's facilities minimize the amount of waste produced at each of our locations. This includes limiting the 
amount of inventory of ancillary chemicals at each location and ensuring that all product is used.  Wastes such as 
metals, universal waste and used oils are recycled to the extent feasible and average 90%. As noted in the "Coal 
Ash Byproduct" section of our report, the company takes great efforts to sell our ash product into the market so 
it can be beneficially reused in accordance with governing laws and regulations for products such as road bed 
material, cement, roof shingles and other marketed products.  All waste generated at each site is appropriately 
collected, contained and transferred to off-site facilities in accordance with all local and federal regulations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The information presented herein includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation 

Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, estimates and projections 

about the industry and markets in which Vistra Corp. (“Vistra”) operates and beliefs of and assumptions made by Vistra’s 

management, involve risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict and are not guarantees of future performance, that 

could significantly affect the financial results of Vistra. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that are presented 

herein, or in response to questions or otherwise, that address activities, events or developments that may occur in the future, 

including such matters as activities related to our financial or operational projections, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 

pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, projected synergy, value lever and net debt targets, 

capital allocation, capital expenditures, liquidity, projected Adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate, dividend policy, 

business and sustainability strategy, competitive strengths, goals, future acquisitions or dispositions, development or operation 

of power generation assets, market and industry developments and the growth of our businesses and operations (often, but not 

always, through the use of words or phrases, or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or 

forward-looking nature, including, but not limited to: “intends,” “plans,” “will likely,” “unlikely,” “believe,” “confident”, “expect,” “seek,” 

“anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “predict,” “project,” “forecast,” “target,” “potential,” 

“goal,” “objective,” “guidance” and “outlook”), are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on 

forward-looking statements. Although Vistra believes that in making any such forward-looking statement, Vistra’s expectations are 

based on reasonable assumptions, any such forward-looking statement involves uncertainties and risks that could cause results to 

differ materially from those projected in or implied by any such forward-looking statement, including, but not limited to: (i) adverse 

changes in general economic or market conditions (including changes in interest rates) or changes in political conditions or federal 

or state laws and regulations; (ii) the ability of Vistra to execute upon its contemplated strategic, capital allocation, performance, 

and cost-saving initiatives and to successfully integrate acquired businesses; (iii) actions by credit ratings agencies; (iv) the severity, 

magnitude and duration of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting effects on our results of operations, 

financial condition and cash flows; (v) the severity, magnitude and duration of extreme weather events (including winter storm Uri), 

contingencies and uncertainties relating thereto, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, 

and the resulting effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows; and (vi) those additional risks and factors 

discussed in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Vistra from time to time, including the uncertainties 

and risks discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in Vistra’s annual report on Form 10-K 

for the year ended December 31, 2021 and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement 

speaks only at the date on which it is made, and except as may be required by law, Vistra will not undertake any obligation to 

update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the 

occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them; nor can 

Vistra assess the impact of each such factor or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ 

materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
