Prioritizing Issues for Our Reporting

The content for our 2014 Corporate Responsibility 
Report Highlights and Chevron.com was determined 
by an issue prioritization process. First, a team of 
employees from across our business segments 
identiﬁ ed environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) topics relevant to our business. The team also 
considered issues covered by the IPIECA/API/OGP* 
2010 Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary 
sustainability reporting, topics addressed in previous 
Corporate Responsibility Reports, feedback received 
on the 2013 Corporate Responsibility Report from 
internal and external audiences, media analysis, 
and industry peer review. Then, the team prioritized 
the identiﬁ ed issues based on an internal analysis 
of topics and their importance to our stakeholders — 
investors, customers, host governments, local 
communities and our employees.

Our prioritized content is aligned with IPIECA/
API/OGP indicators. For 2014, Chevron reported 
fully to all 33 indicators. An IPIECA/API/OGP 
content index is available on page 23 of this report. 
In addition to this Highlights report, our expanded 
reporting on these indicators can be found at 
Chevron.com/IPIECA.

A Message From Our Chairman and CEO

John S. Watson
Chairman of the Board and 
Chief Executive Officer
May 2015

At Chevron, our vision is to be the global energy company 
most admired for its people, partnership and performance. 
To accomplish this, we’ve built our company’s foundation 
on our values, which distinguish and guide us in all we 
do. These values are laid out in The Chevron Way, a key 
corporate document that provides a framework for us to 
follow in getting results the right way. Our 2014 Corporate 
Responsibility Report highlights three of our speciﬁ c 
values — partnership, diversity, and protecting people and 
the environment.

We believe that business investments are the foundation 
of corporate responsibility. Not only do we produce reliable 
and affordable energy to enable economies, but also, in 
doing so we advance the communities in which we operate 
by purchasing local goods and services, creating jobs, 
and generating revenue. In 2014, for example, we spent 
more than $63 billion on goods and services globally. 
Of that, nearly $1 billion was spent on goods and services 
from women- and minority-owned businesses in the 
United States and more than $2.5 billion on goods and 
services from U.S.-based small businesses. 

Beyond our direct business investments, we make select 
social investments in three core areas — health, education 
and economic development — to develop skilled workers, 
improve access to health care, and boost local and regional 
economies. We know that healthy businesses require healthy 
communities. To this end, we’ve made approximately 
$1.7 billion in social investments to local communities over 
the past nine years. And in 2014 alone, we spent approxi-
mately $240 million on global social investments. 

We make these business and social investments in partner-
ship with local governments and communities, our busi-
ness partners, and our stakeholders. Everywhere Chevron 
operates, we strive to build partnerships to create lasting 
prosperity. We work to identify community needs, and then 
we invest in solutions and programs that will create meas-
urable and enduring value. Our commitment is to manage 
the effects of our operations and make strategic social 
investments throughout the life cycles of our projects. 

To ensure our people are well equipped to work with 
our partners, we are committed to building a workforce 
that represents the many countries where we operate. 
We believe that sustainable high performance is achieved 
by creating a culture that encourages and values people 
who offer a wide range of experiences and knowledge. In 
2014, Chevron received prestigious honors and recognition 
for promoting a diverse and inclusive workforce. For the 
10th consecutive year, we achieved a rating of 100 percent 
on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, 
which ranks U.S. companies committed to equality in 
the workplace. We were the only company in the oil and 
natural gas industry to earn a perfect score. In 2015, 
Chevron received the Catalyst Award in recognition of 
our effort to attract, retain, develop and advance women. 
Valuing diversity in our workforce is key to achieving our 
vision to be the global energy company most admired for 
its people, partnership and performance.

We know our continued success depends on our perform-
ance. Our Operational Excellence Management System 
provides a disciplined approach to working safely, protect-
ing the environment, and operating reliably and efﬁ ciently. 

In 2014, we delivered our best overall year in personal 
safety, as measured by recordable injuries and injuries 
requiring time away from work, and in process safety, as 
measured by loss-of-containment incidents. We also 
had record lows in our petroleum spill volume and motor 
vehicle crash rate. Our relentless focus on operational 
excellence — including efforts to strengthen process safety 
management and ensure the integrity of safeguards — 
contributed to the strong overall performance. 

Chevron is committed to meeting our goal of zero 
incidents and will continue to focus on achieving world-
class performance in all measures of safety and environ-
mental stewardship. You can track our efforts online at 
Chevron.com/CR, where we provide details about our 
efforts to invest in people, projects and communities that 
make our business possible.

Protecting People and the Environment

 Managing 
 Operational Risk

Ingrained in The Chevron Way is our 
commitment to protecting people and the 
environment, which includes developing 
energy safely and reliably. We strive 
to develop a culture in which everyone 
believes that all incidents are preventable 
and that “zero incidents” is achievable.

Our Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS) is a 
comprehensive, proven means to systematically manage process 
safety, personal safety and health, the environment, reliability, 
and efficiency. Through disciplined application of the OEMS, we 
identify and mitigate risks by integrating operational excellence 
processes, standards, procedures and behaviors into our daily 
operations. Our OEMS is aligned with ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 
18001:2007, as well as with the Center for Chemical Process 
Safety’s Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety.*

Within the OEMS, we use a management system process to drive 
continual improvement toward world-class performance. This process 
is linked to business planning and begins with defining a vision of 
success and setting objectives. Gaps between current performance 
and these objectives are identified during annual assessments. 
We develop plans to close the gaps, implement the plans and review 
plan implementation performance.

We set high expectations for ourselves, which requires active 
leadership. Chevron’s Board of Directors and Board committees 
oversee Chevron’s risk management policies and practices. In doing 
so, the Board monitors the risk assessment and management sys-
tems that are employed throughout the company. We also adopt 
and share best practices with our business and industry partners, 
and we continually take action to improve our practices and meet 
our commitments. In 2014, our Days Away From Work Rate for our 
employees and contractor workforce, at 0.02 per 200,000 work-
hours, matched our 2013 record low rate.

 *  According to Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd., our OEMS meets the requirements of the 

International Organization for Standardization environmental management system standard and 
the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series management system speciﬁ cation.

0Our Focus: 

Zero
Incidents

In 2014, as part of our drive 
for excellence, Chevron’s 
Zero Is Attainable program 
was enhanced to set the 
bar even higher.

Our Zero Is Attainable 
Award for Personal Safety is 
granted to organizations that 
have completed a minimum 
of 1 million hours or 1,000 days 
worked without experiencing 
a work-related fatality, a Days 
Away From Work incident 
or a Restricted Duty incident. 
There were 66 organizations 
that met this goal in 2014. 

Our Zero Is Attainable 
Award for Process Safety 
was a new addition to the pro-
gram in 2014. Organizations 
that achieve six consecutive 
months without a Tier 1 
and Tier 2 loss-of-primary-
containment incident are 
eligible. In 2014, 36 organiza-
tions qualiﬁ ed for this award.

Our Focus Areas and 2014 Highlights

Product Stewardship

Chevron works to minimize the 
risks and impacts associated with 
all aspects of the life cycle of our 
products, including manufacture, 
transport, use and disposal. 
We assess safety, health and 
environmental information, as 
well as compliance with product 
safety legal requirements both 
where our products are made 
and where they are sold or used. 
Our OEMS is designed to help 
assess compliance with product 
stewardship requirements 
around the world.

The Globally Harmonized 
System of Classiﬁ cation 

and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) 
is being implemented in more 

than 65 countries. To meet 
2015 deadlines in countries that 
include the United States and 
the 28 European Union member 
states, Chevron is classifying 
products and revising Safety 
Data Sheets (SDSs) under the 
GHS. In 2014, Chevron updated 
more than 14,500 SDSs in 
37 languages to meet these 
new requirements and other 
compliance obligations. 

Workforce Health 
and Safety 

We are committed to protecting 
the safety and health of our more 
than 61,000 employees and our 
approximately 226,000 full-time-
equivalent contractor workforce. 

We identify and mitigate risk by 
applying policies, processes and 
technologies to maintain our 
focus on having zero incidents. 

In 2014, our Total Record-
able Incident Rate for our 

workforce was the lowest we 
have ever recorded, at 0.18 per 
200,000 work-hours.

Process Safety 

We apply our Operational 
Excellence Management System 
to manage process safety and 
work to prevent serious inci-
dents, such as explosions, ﬁ res 
and accidental releases. Along 
with our ongoing operational 
focus, we conduct reviews of 
facilities to reduce risk, perform 
ﬁ eld validation of safeguards to 
ensure they are effective, con-
tinuously improve process safety 
operating procedures, and con-
duct hazard analyses to identify 
ways to prevent injury and loss of 
containment.

We saw a signiﬁ cant 
reduction in Tier 1 loss-

of-primary-containment 
incidents,* from 38 in 2013 to 
19 in 2014. Programs aimed at 
improving this metric involved 
enhancements to asset integ-
rity management, effective 
operating procedures and risk 
management, process safety per-
formance tracking, well safety, 
and the building of process 
safety competency at all levels.

 *  American Petroleum Institute Recommended 
Practice 754 deﬁ nes Tier 1 loss-of-primary-
containment incidents as certain signiﬁ cant 
unplanned or uncontrolled releases of material 
from primary containment, including nontoxic 
and nonﬂ ammable materials.

Protecting People and the Environment

 Protecting 
 the Environment

Chevron develops energy resources with a 
commitment to protecting the environment 
using world-class environmental practices 
and standards. For Chevron, getting results 
the right way happens throughout the 
life of our facilities  — from planning and 
construction through operation and 
decommissioning.

To achieve this, we use our Operational Excellence Management 
System to manage potential impacts from the activities that may 
affect the environment. Through the application of our Corporate 
Processes and Standards and our work with industry groups, 
our businesses identify meaningful information that enables them 
to prioritize and focus their continuous improvement efforts.

Petroleum Spill Volume*
Decreasing Over Time

We work every day to review 
and improve our internal 
controls to prevent spills. 
These safeguards include 
assuring the integrity of our 
equipment design and main-
tenance and the training 
of our personnel.

In 2014, Chevron achieved 
a record low petroleum spill 
volume of 838 barrels.

Principles

4Environmental

Protecting people and the 
environment is one of our 
company’s core values, as 
detailed in The Chevron Way. 

In support of our values, we 
developed four environmental 
principles that deﬁ ne our 
commitment to doing busi-
ness in environmentally 
responsible ways:

Include the Environment in 
Decision Making: We all make 
decisions that may affect 
the environment. From our 
everyday actions to major 
capital investments, we make 
better decisions when we 
consider the environment. 

Reduce Our Environmental 
Footprint: We use our 
business processes to identify 
and manage risks to the 
environment and reduce 
potential environmental 
impacts throughout the life 
of our assets.

Operate Responsibly: We 
apply our Tenets of Operation 
and improve reliability and 
process safety to prevent 
accidental releases. 

Steward Our Sites: We work 
to decommission, remediate 
and reclaim operating and 
legacy sites with the aim of 
beneﬁ cial reuse.

global economy. Additionally, we 
apply cost-effective technologies 
to improve the energy efﬁ ciency 
of our base business operations 
and capital projects.

National Park in West Java, Indonesia. Chevron and Conservation International jointly 
sponsored the camera program to monitor rare and endangered species. Recent photos 
have confirmed the population growth of the Javan leopard and other species. 

Biodiversity

We recognize the importance 
of conserving biodiversity. 
We strive to avoid or reduce 
the potential for signiﬁ cant 
impacts on sensitive species, 
habitats and ecosystems.

Chevron’s Salak opera-
tion — one of the world’s 

largest geothermal ﬁ elds — is situ-
ated within one of Indonesia’s 
largest national parks. Since 
2006, Chevron has worked 
with park rangers, international 
wildlife groups and other stake-
holders to protect biodiversity 
through species monitoring 
and environmental education. 
In 2014, Chevron collaborated 
with Conservation International 
to use motion-activated cam-
eras to identify and track Javan 
leopards and other rare and

endangered species living in the 
contract area. In addition, as part 
of a ﬁ ve-year collaboration with 
KEHATI (Indonesian Biodiversity 
Foundation), a nongovernmental 
organization, Chevron supported 
and provided volunteers for the 
restoration of degraded forest 
corridors outside our operational 
area within the national park. 

Climate Change 
and Energy Efﬁ ciency 

We share the concerns of 
governments and the public 
about climate change risks and 
recognize that the use of fossil 
fuels to meet the world’s energy 
needs is a contributor to rising 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) in 
the earth’s atmosphere. We are 
taking steps to manage GHGs 
and other air emissions while 
supporting the growth of the 

We received an overall score 
of 95 points — the highest of 
all our integrated oil and gas 
competitors — in the 2014 
CDP S&P 500 Climate Change 
Report. This score reflects 
Chevron’s transparency in 
disclosing our GHG emissions 
and our climate policies.

Chevron is Kazakhstan’s 
largest private oil and 
gas producer, with a 50 percent 
interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO). 
Since 2000, TCO has invested 
approximately $3 billion in envi-
ronmental projects and has 
increased gas utilization rates 
to more than 99 percent by 
using the produced gas as a fuel, 
reinjecting it into the Tengiz 
Field reservoir, or selling it on 
the domestic and export mar-
kets. Gas utilization and other 
programs have increased energy 
efﬁ ciency and helped reduce 
total emissions generated per 
tonne of oil produced by 73 per-
cent in the same time period.

Water

We recognize that water, and 
particularly fresh water, is a 
critical resource for business, 
communities and the environ-
ment. Although our industry 
is not among the largest users 
of fresh water in California, 
we continue to improve our 
water management practices as 
the state faces severe drought.

Chevron’s California 
reﬁ neries use recycled and 
reclaimed water for the majority 
of their water needs. Since 1999, 
recycled water has supplied more 
than 70 percent of water needs 
at our El Segundo Reﬁ nery. 
Today, approximately 60 percent 
of water used at our Richmond 

Reﬁ nery comes from reclaimed 
municipal sources. In addition, 
our Kern River and San Ardo 
oil ﬁ elds capture and treat pro-
duced water* for agricultural 
use. For every one barrel of oil 
we extract in Kern County, the 
process generates 10 barrels of 
produced water, some of which 
we capture, treat and distribute 
to local farmers.

 *  Water that is brought to the surface during 

operations that extract hydrocarbons from oil 
and gas reservoirs.

Chevron’s environmental prin-
ciples into practice across the 
enterprise, working in more than 
35 countries around the world.

Chevron helped convert 
property at our former 

Louisville, Kentucky, lubricants 
plant, after a century of use, 
into a student parking lot for 
the University of Louisville. EMC 
provided oversight of the beneﬁ -
cial reuse project, ensuring that 
the site was redeveloped in a 
way that protected public health 
and that solar-powered technol-
ogies were used during the site 
remediation work. 

In 2014, Chevron 
became the first 
energy company to 
meet the Center for 
Sustainable Shale 
Development’s 
voluntary shale gas 
drilling standards. 

The 15 performance 
standards include surface 
water and groundwater 
standards that require 
maximizing water recycling 
and developing ground-
water protection plans.

Global 
Economic
Impact

Chevron recently commis-
sioned the consulting 
ﬁ rm IHS to conduct eco-
nomic impact studies to 
quantify the direct, indirect 
and induced economic 
contributions* associated 
with our operations.

Highlights of the ﬁ ndings 
include the following: 

In 2012, every direct Chevron 
job supported 29 additional 
jobs in Thailand, and Chevron 
helped drive more than 
2.4 percent of the country’s 
gross domestic product.

In 2013, the Chevron Gulf 
of Mexico Business Unit 
supported 61,500 jobs in 
the United States, including 
26,200 in Louisiana, 14,000 
in Mississippi and 750 in 
Alabama. In 2011, Chevron’s 
contribution to Louisiana’s 
gross state product was 
$6.5 billion. This contribution 
was more than seven times 
the economic contribution 
of the seafood industry 
($877 million) and almost 
two-thirds of the economic 
contribution of the tourism 
industry ($10.3 billion).

 *  Direct: Capital and operating expendi-
tures that directly enter the economy 
as spending on local goods and services. 
Indirect: Spending with local supply 
chain and service providers. 
Induced: National economic activity 
occurring as a result of direct and indi-
rect employee salary spending.

Our Focus Areas and 2014 Highlights

Capacity Building

Supplier Sourcing

We design and implement pro-
grams to help local companies 
meet industry standards and 
provide goods and services 
to Chevron and other oil and 
gas producers.

Chevron Nigeria Limited 
(CNL) has partnered 

with Nigerian oil and gas serv-
ices companies to grow their 
capacity to supply both onshore 
and offshore oilﬁ eld equipment 
and services. In 2014, CNL part-
nered with Beneprojecti Nigeria 
Limited to manufacture and 
deliver a Dynamic Positions II 
platform support vessel, which 
is a ship specially designed to 
supply and support offshore oil 
and gas operations. 

We consider and assess the 
capacity of local businesses and 
supply chains when developing 
national and local content 
for our major capital projects 
and our ongoing operations. 
We collaborate with national 
and local governments, national 
oil companies, nongovernmental 
organizations, and development 
agencies to identify high-impact, 
sustainable supplier and work-
force development opportunities 
within our own supply chain and 
our contractors’ supply chains.

In 2014, Chevron Australia 
created the Chevron 
West Pilbara Business Support 
Program, an integrated approach 
to providing services, support 
and guidance to help local small 
businesses grow and compete 

within the resources sector 
in Western Australia.

Local Hiring

We are committed to having a

Social 
Performance

Chevron contributes to the economic 
and social well-being of people in 
the countries where we operate because 
we have learned through decades of 
experience that our business success is 
deeply linked to society’s progress. 

Our social performance — defined as the systematic management 
of social impacts and stakeholder relationships — relies on conducting 
business in an ethical and responsible way and engaging openly 
with our workforce, partners and communities.

Chevron’s
Bangladesh 
Partnership 
Initiative 
commitment
represents one 
of the largest 
corporate social 
investments 
for Bangladesh.

$10 MILLION 
COMMITMENT
5-YEAR PROGRAM

Our $20 million investment in the new Appalachia 
Partnership Initiative is designed to foster education 
and workforce development in the Tri-State area 
of Pittsburgh in the United States. 

In 2014, Chevron announced a $10 million commitment 
to create the Bangladesh Partnership Initiative (BPI), 
a ﬁ ve-year program to support economic development 
for communities in the Greater Sylhet region.

The initiative is a partnership with the Allegheny Confer-
ence on Community Development, the Claude Worthington 
Benedum Foundation and RAND Corporation. It seeks 
to improve the quality of education in 27 counties across 
southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and 
eastern Ohio. 

Over the next ﬁ ve years, the BPI will work with local non-
governmental and international development organizations 
to assess local needs and establish enterprise and work-
force development programs. Chevron’s BPI commitment 
represents one of the largest corporate social investments 
for Bangladesh.

EDUCATION

HEALTH

A MORE THAN
$100 MILLION
INVESTMENT
IN EDUCATION
OVER THE PAST
3 YEARS

Chevron invested more than $100 million in education over the past three years 
in the United States and has pledged an additional $30 million through 2015 to 
support science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education.

The Fab Foundation

Chevron partners with the Fab Foundation to bring its fabrication labs 
(Fab Labs) to areas where we operate across the United States. 

The Fab Foundation emerged from the Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy’s Center for Bits & Atoms Fab Lab Program. A Fab Lab consists of 
a suite of digital fabrication and rapid prototyping machines, such as 3-D 
printers. Working in Fab Labs, students can develop the critical thinking, 
problem solving and analytical skills needed to innovate. In September 2014, 
Chevron launched its ﬁ rst sponsored Fab Lab at California State University, 
Bakersﬁ eld. The Fab Labs will provide approximately 20,000 students 
and adults with a hands-on science and technology experience.

Pact

Chevron is committed to 
the prevention of mother-
to-child transmission 
(PMTCT) of HIV. Through 
our partnership with Pact 
in Bayelsa State, Nigeria, 
we have established 
a community-based and 
government-supported 
PMTCT outreach program 
across the state. 

Since launching in 2012, our 
partnership has helped train 
more than 440 individuals on 
the latest PMTCT approaches 
and techniques, has contrib-
uted to more than 30,000 
pregnant women being tested 
for HIV, and has reached more 
than 117,800 individuals with 
PMTCT messaging.

ZERO

REPORTS OF
MOTHER-TO-CHILD
TRANSMISSION OF HIV

Chevron has received no reports 
of mother-to-child transmission of 
HIV among its employees or qualified 
dependents participating in PMTCT 
programs since 2001 in Nigeria.

Lab at California State University, Bakers-

learning and explore the engineering 
design process in a real-world context. 
Chevron’s recent $10 million contribution

development of Fab Labs in areas where 
we operate across the United States.

 Our Focus Areas and 2014 Highlights

Human Rights

Chevron’s commitment to 
respecting human rights wher-
ever we operate is embodied 
in The Chevron Way, our Opera-
tional Excellence Management 
System, our Business Conduct 
and Ethics Code, and our Human 
Rights Policy. Chevron is a leader 
on human rights issues and 
actively works with industry and 
human rights organizations to 
share knowledge and experience.

For 2014–2015, Chevron 
holds leadership positions 

in industry groups on human 
rights and responsible security 
and is currently serving as the 
lead corporate pillar representa-
tive on the steering committee 
for the Voluntary Principles 
on Security and Human Rights 
initiative. Our participation in 
the initiative since its founding in 
2000 demonstrates our long-
standing commitment to critical 
security and human rights issues.

Stakeholder 
Engagement 

Building trusted, long-term 
relationships with communities, 
host governments and other 
stakeholders provides us with 
invaluable opportunities to 
share information and receive 
feedback about our operations 
and activities. This open dialogue 
enables us to identify oppor-
tunities for mutually beneﬁ cial 
growth jointly with our partners. 

In 2014, we deployed a 
revised Stakeholder 
Engagement process embedded 
in our Operational Excellence 
Management System.

Revenue 
Transparency

We believe that the transparent 
and accurate accounting of 
revenues by governments and 
extractive industry companies 
contributes to stable, long-term 

investment climates, economic 
growth and social well-being 
in resource-rich countries. To 
promote revenue transparency 
globally, we participate in the 
multinational, multistakeholder-
run Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI).

To date, Chevron is the 
longest continually serving 
member of the global EITI board. 
We currently operate in or 
have a nonoperated working 
interest in 17 EITI-implementing 
countries, including Indonesia, 
Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria 
and the United States.

Social Investment 

Our social performance is 
enhanced by our large-scale 
social investment partnerships 
that support improving access to 
health, education and economic 
development opportunities 
in the areas where we operate. 
Our social investments aim 
to foster economic stability and 
improve the quality of life in 
the communities where we work.

In 2014, we spent more 
than $240 million globally.

performance at Chevron.com/CR.

Investing in People

Diverse, 
Engaged and 
Capable 
Workforce

We invest in people to strengthen 
organizational capability and develop 
a talented global workforce that gets 
results the right way. Our success 
in attracting, developing and retaining 
a diverse workforce comes from 
strategies, programs and processes 
based on The Chevron Way. 

We are committed to building a workforce that represents the 
many countries where we operate. We believe that sustainable high 
performance is achieved by creating a culture that encourages 
and values people with a wide range of experiences and knowledge.

21,000 
EMPLOYEES

In  2014,  an  estimated  21,000  employees — about  one-
third of our regular workforce  — participated in Chevron’s 
many  employee  networks  that  celebrate  cultural  and 
lifestyle differences.

Chevron was honored to 
receive the prestigious 
2015 Catalyst Award, the 
premier honor for companies 
committed to expanding 
opportunities for women. 

Our application for the 
Catalyst Award — titled 
“The Chevron Way: 
Engineering Opportunities 
for Women”— details how 
The Chevron Way’s focus 
on people over the past 
two decades established a 
culture that attracted 
and retained more diverse 
talent in our workforce.

The application also shows 
how The Chevron Way 
served as a primary driver 
for our diversity strategy 
that includes programs, proc-
esses and tools to facilitate 
gender diversity and help 
increase the number of 
women in leadership roles. 

To be considered for the 
Catalyst Award, we partici-
pated in a rigorous, yearlong 
application and review process 
that included extensive 
documentation and interviews 
with more than 60 employees 
and leaders. We shared 
information and perspectives 
with Catalyst regarding our 
business rationale, senior 
leadership support, account-
ability, communication, 
employee engagement, inno-
vation and measurable results.

Our	Focus	Areas	and	2014	Highlights

Workforce	Training		
and	Development

Chevron’s	more	than	61,000		
employees	are	an	integral	part		
of	the	success	of	our	business,		
and	we	are	committed	to	contrib-
uting	to	their	career	goals	and	
professional	development.

In	2014,	nearly	3,200		
employees	were	active	in		
Horizons,	an	accelerated	devel-
opment	program	that	builds		
the	technical	competency	of		
employees	who	have	fewer	than

Diversity

We	strive	to	be	a	leader	in		
global	diversity	and	a	company	
that	values	and	uses	diverse	
viewpoints	to	drive	our	busi-	
ness	growth.

In	2014,	Chevron	received	
prestigious	honors	and	
recognition	for	promoting	a	
diverse	and	inclusive	workforce.	
For	the	10th	consecutive	year,	we	
achieved	a	rating	of	100	percent	
on	the	Human	Rights	Campaign	
Corporate	Equality	Index,	which	
ranks	U.S.	companies	committed		
to	lesbian,	gay,	bisexual	and	
transgender	(LGBT)	equality	in		
the	workplace.	We	were	the		
only	company	in	the	oil	and	gas	
industry	to	earn	a	perfect	score.	
We	also	received	the	2014	Work-	
place	Excellence	Award	from		
Out	&	Equal	Workplace	Advocates		
for	our	dedication	to	achieving		
LGBT	workplace	equality.

Workforce	Engagement

We	communicate	openly	with	
our	more	than	61,000	employees,	
which	is	necessary	to	grow	a	
high-performing	workforce	and	

achieve	our	joint	objectives		
as	a	company.

In	2014,	in	addition	to		
our	annual	Worldwide	
Employee	Town	Hall,	we	engaged	
employees	on	a	wide	variety		
of	topics	through	our	employee	
networks,	leadership	develop-
ment	programs	and	formal	
mentoring	program.	Chairman	
and	CEO	John	Watson	held		
informal	meetings	with	a

 9 2014 environmental, health and safety 

fines and settlements were $56.8 million. 
Health and safety fines and settlements 
accounted for approximately $261,860, 
representing 0.5 percent of the total 
fines and settlements.

 10 Health and safety performance rates 

include both injury- and illness-related 
incidents. 

 The American Petroleum Institute’s 
Benchmarking Survey of Occupational 
Injuries, Illnesses and Fatalities in the 
Petroleum Industry data are used as 
industry benchmarks. Benchmark data 
on competitor-average performance 
in 2014 were not available at the time 
of publication.

 11 Data include catastrophic and major 

incidents only.

 12 Loss-of-containment incidents are 

unplanned or uncontrolled releases 
resulting in consequences equivalent to 
those specified by the American National 
Standards Institute/American Petroleum 
Institute (ANSI/API) Recommended 
Practice 754 and Oil and Gas Producers 
(OGP) Report 456: Process Safety 
Recommended Practice on Key 
Performance Indicators.

Performance Data

Notes to pages 18 through 21

  1 Spills to land and water that are greater 
than or equal to one barrel are included. 

 Petroleum spill volume in 2014 set a 
record low — 50 percent below our 
previous lowest result (1,700 barrels in 
2012). The number of petroleum spills 
in 2014 was also the lowest ever recorded 
for Chevron. In 2014, 79 petroleum 
spills released 838 barrels, compared 
with 2,135 barrels released by 133 spills 
in 2013.

 2 In 2014, our freshwater withdrawals 

totaled 85 million metric tons, a 9 per-
cent decrease compared with 2013. 
To reduce our freshwater demand, we 
reused and recycled wastewater.

  3 Oil concentration is determined by the 

sampling of effluent streams. 

 Chevron reports the total cumulative 
amount of oil discharged to surface 
water excluding spills, which are reported 
separately. In 2014, Chevron operations 
recorded a cumulative discharge of 
1,311 metric tons of oil to surface water, a 
decrease of 8 percent from 1,418 metric 
tons in 2013. 

 4 In 2014, emissions were 56 million metric 
tons of CO2 equivalent, better than our 
goal of 58 million metric tons. Chevron’s 
chosen base-year emissions in 2010, which 
account for adjustments like acquisitions 
and divestitures, would have been 56 mil-
lion metric tons. Therefore, Chevron’s 
2014 emissions are about the same as the 
base-year emissions. The 2014 flaring and 
venting GHG emissions are based on a 
flare gas volume of 563 million cubic feet 
per day and a venting volume of 69 million 
cubic feet per day. 

 Chevron’s GHG emissions goal for 2015 is 
57 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. 
To meet anticipated worldwide energy 
demand, Chevron’s long-term strategy 
has been to grow profitably in core 
areas and add production in new areas. 
Accordingly, Chevron is projecting net 
production of 3.1 million barrels of oil-
equivalent per day in 2017. As Chevron’s 
business grows beyond 2015 for the 
long term, absolute GHG emissions will 
increase. The emissions’ intensity will 
also grow as the energy intensity of the 
operations increases, though it will be 
moderated by continuing improvements 
in energy efficiency and minimizing flar-
ing. For example, much of our projected 
emissions growth will be in liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) production. When used 
in power generation, LNG can drive 
improved global, life-cycle GHG emissions 

compared with other fuels. Similarly, 
our gas-to-liquids project in Nigeria will 
provide a beneficial outlet for gas that 
might otherwise have been flared — a 
direct result of our efforts toward reduc-
ing flaring, which have been under way 
for several years.

 Combustion of our products resulted in 
emissions of 358 million metric tons of 
CO2 equivalent in 2014, which is lower 
than the 363 million metric tons emitted 
in 2013.

 5 The total energy consumption of 

Chevron’s operated assets in 2014 was 
702 trillion Btu, at a cost of $6.5 billion.

 6 VOC emissions decreased by 8 percent 
from 2013. VOCs declined significantly 
beginning in 2012 in part from the instal-
lation of abatement devices in Sumatra 
as well as improved emissions estimation 
methodologies. VOCs result primarily 
from fugitive emissions from equipment 
(such as valves, pumps and compressors), 
flaring, venting and flashing gas. 

 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions decreased 
by 20 percent from 2013. The decrease 
resulted from new opportunities to col-
lect and export gas that previously was 
flared in Saudi Arabia/the Partitioned 
Zone. Nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulfur 
oxides (SOX) are combustion byproducts.

 Some prior years’ air emissions are 
restated in this report using site-specific 
data and improved air emissions 
estimating methods.

  7 Actual air emissions data (including 
VOC, SOX and NOX data) for certain 
Downstream and Chemicals facilities 
are not currently finalized because 
regulatory deadlines for submitting air 
emissions data fall after the publication 
date of the Corporate Responsibility 
Report. In these cases, an estimate 
based on previous data is used in place 
of actual emissions data. Consequently, 
the total air emissions for Downstream 
and Chemicals may vary after all data 
are reported. 

 8 Waste amounts are quantified using 

methods required or recommended by 
regulatory agencies or authorities 
where applicable. In other instances, 
similar methods are used, including 
direct measurement onsite or at the 
point of shipping, engineering estimates, 
or process knowledge. 

 Chevron follows the regulatory defini-
tions of hazardous waste, including 
de minimis specifications, below which 
hazardous waste quantities do not 
need to be reported.

LRQA Assurance Statement
Relating to Chevron Corporation’s Corporate Responsibility Report for the Calendar Year 2014

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Chevron U.S.A. 
Inc. in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers 
of this Report. 

Observations 
Further observations and findings, made during the assurance 
engagement, are:

Terms of Engagement
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Inc. (LRQA) was commissioned by 
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. on behalf of Chevron Corporation (Chevron) to 
provide independent assurance on its processes used in the creation 
of the Corporate Responsibility Report (CRR) for calendar year 2014 
to a reasonable level using LRQA’s verification approach.

Our assurance engagement covered Chevron’s operations and activ-
ities worldwide and specifically covered the following requirements:

•  Reviewing the effectiveness of the processes for reporting health, 
environmental and safety (HES) IPIECA performance indicators.

•  Confirming consistency with the IPIECA/API/OGP Oil and gas 
industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting (2010) 
industry guidelines.

•  Processes were in place to ensure that sites contributing to HES metrics 

understood corporate reporting procedures and requirements.

•  Methods used for calculating each HES performance metric were clearly 

defined and communicated.

•  Chevron’s reporting requirements for HES metrics were understood 

and carried out. Data collected at the site/local and business-unit levels 
were checked and aggregated into corporationwide metrics.

•  Responsibility for annually reviewing and updating reporting guidelines 

was clear, with improvement in methodology regularly undertaken.

Recommendations 

   Additional areas for improvement were provided in a separate report to 
Chevron management. These recommendations do not affect our opinion.

   Our assurance engagement did not include verifying the accuracy 

LRQA’s Competence and Independence

of data and information reported in the CRR.

   LRQA’s responsibility is only to Chevron. LRQA disclaims any 

liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. 
Chevron’s management was responsible for preparing the CRR 
and for maintaining effective internal controls over the reporting 
processes and CRR. LRQA’s responsibility was to carry out an 
assurance engagement on the reporting processes in accordance 
with our contract with Chevron. Ultimately, the CRR has been 
approved by, and remains the responsibility of, Chevron.

   LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based 

on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all 
verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed 
by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous 
and transparent.

   LRQA is Chevron’s certification body for ISO 9001, TS 16949 and 

Emission Trading Schemes (ISO 14064). The certification assessments 
and verification are the only work undertaken by LRQA for Chevron 
and as such do not compromise our independence or impartiality.

LRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach, we believe that Chevron’s reporting proc-
esses were effective in delivering HES indicators that are useful for 
assessing corporate performance and reporting information consistent 
with common reporting elements in the IPIECA/API/OGP Oil and gas 
industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting (2010). 

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a reasonable level 
of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgment of 
the Verifier.

LRQA’s Approach
LRQA’s assurance engagement was carried out in accordance with our 
verification procedure;* the following tasks, though, were undertaken as 
part of the evidence-gathering process for this assurance engagement:

•  Visiting Chevron Corporation in San Ramon, California, to review data 

collection and checking processes.

•  Visiting Chevron Upstream and Gas offices in Houston, Texas, and 
Chevron Downstream and Chemicals headquarters in San Ramon, 
California, to assess business unit understanding and implementation 
of Chevron’s HES reporting requirements.

•  Visiting two Chevron Upstream and Gas operations in Angola and 

the United States, Shipping headquarters in the United States and one 
Chevron Oronite operation in France to assess local understanding 
and implementation of Chevron’s HES reporting requirements.

•   Interviewing key personnel to identify and gain an understanding 

of Chevron’s reporting requirements, including key persons responsible 
for drafting the CRR.

•  Reviewing Chevron’s documented reporting requirements to validate 

consistency of scope, definition and reporting requirements for each of 
the HES performance indicators.

•  Reviewing Chevron’s primary data collection tools to assess use in the 

reporting processes.

•  Evaluating consistency with the IPIECA/API/OGP Oil and gas industry
