LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

“Our greatest strength is developing the 
technology and techniques that maximize 
value while increasing safety, efﬁ ciency, 
and environmental performance.”

Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman and CEO 
Keynote Address at CERAWeek, March 9, 2012

In an era of global change and market volatil-
ity, one thing is certain: citizens around the 
world will continue to seek economic and 
social progress to build a better quality of life 
for themselves and their families. The role of 
secure, reliable, and affordable energy in sup-
porting these aspirations will be critical.

and at our integrated reﬁ nery and chemical 
facility in Singapore (page 48), we are apply-
ing our global management standards to help 
us engage communities, and improve envi-
ronmental and safety performance. We hope 
these “site visits” will provide you, our reader, 
with a clearer understanding of our practices.

At ExxonMobil, we are proud of the role we 
play in supplying the energy to meet the 
world’s needs. These needs are expected to 
grow by about 30 percent by 2040, as econo-
mies expand and the world’s population 
approaches 9 billion people. Providing this 
energy in a safe and environmentally respon-
sible manner, and at the enormous scale that 
will be required, is one of the great challenges 
facing the world in the coming decades.

This Corporate Citizenship Report explains 
how ExxonMobil is playing its role in meeting 
this challenge. In it, we document our plans, 
initiatives, and performance related to safety, 
the environment, economic development, 
corporate governance, and social progress. 

Integrity in action
As you will read in this report, ExxonMobil’s 
approach to business and corporate citizen-
ship is built upon a commitment to integrity in 
everything we do. Simply put, integrity is a com-
mitment to do the right thing, the right way, every 
time—from business operations and technical 
challenges to the way we manage our business 
partnerships and engage with stakeholders.

Integrity in our industry makes us more respon-
sible, more innovative, and more productive. 
In the decades ahead, we believe this will 
be essential for meeting the world’s energy 
needs—and for fulﬁ lling our responsibility to 
future generations.

This year’s report includes two case studies 
that demonstrate integrity in action. At our 
Kearl oil sands project in Canada (page 10) 

Comprehensive risk management
Risk management is another key element in 
our approach to corporate citizenship. Few 
industries are called upon to manage as 
many complex risks as the energy sector. 
ExxonMobil has operations around the world, 
in some of the harshest climates and environ-
ments. What makes our business successful is 
our commitment to carefully and systematically 
identify, plan for, and manage risk. We do this 
through a rigorous management approach— 
our Operations Integrity Management System, 
or OIMS, outlined on page 35. OIMS integrates 
safety, security, health, environmental, and 
social risk management into every aspect of 
our business. This year, some of the trends 
in our safety and environmental performance 
did not meet our expectations and we are 
taking action to address them. We will not stop 
working to achieve our goal of driving acci-
dents and incidents with a real impact to zero. 

Stakeholder engagement
Finally, our commitment to corporate 
citizenship is fundamental to our business, 
government, and community relationships. 

The need for energy—vital for economic 
development and human progress—must 
be met while addressing environmental and 
social impacts associated with increasing 
demand for energy resources. 

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     1

a number of ways. On the issue of climate 
change, for example, we participated as an 
observer in the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change meeting 
in Durban, South Africa (page 25), and we 
maintain ongoing discussions with legislators 
and ofﬁ cials on policy and technology options 
to address rising greenhouse gas emissions. 
In communities where we are producing shale 
natural gas, we are working with city councils, 
neighbors, homeowners, and regulators to 
open lines of communication and share facts 
and information (page 14). In nations around the 
world, we are reaching out using engagement 
methods as diverse as the communities where 
we operate. For instance, in countries like 
Papua New Guinea, we have developed out-
reach strategies that are sensitive to the local 
culture and customs (page 47). This report itself 
is part of our commitment to engagement with 
those who take an interest in our company.

In the following pages, you will ﬁ nd a 
summary of our efforts to communicate with 
stakeholders on our shared priorities; these 
include responsible unconventional resource 
development, water use, biodiversity, trans-
parency, and our dialogue and engagement 
with indigenous communities, among others. 
In each case, we know that engagement on 
these items leads to stronger, more sustain-
able business performance.

At ExxonMobil, we believe that high standards 
and clear metrics are critical to discharging 
our responsibilities as a leading global energy 
producer and corporate citizen. We invite you 
to read about our citizenship performance in 
this report, and we welcome your comments.

We believe addressing this dual challenge 
requires constructive and respectful engage-
ment with our stakeholders. We do this in

The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040

Each year, ExxonMobil takes a comprehensive look at long-term trends in energy demand, supply, 
emissions, and technology to guide our own investment decisions. In 2012, we extended our Outlook 
to the year 2040. The Outlook projects that global energy demand in 2040 will be about 30 percent 
higher than in 2010, even with signiﬁ cant gains in energy efﬁ ciency. It is clear that expanding prosperity 
across a world with a growing population requires access to reliable and affordable energy supplies.

From cars to cell phones, pharmaceuticals to plastics, and air conditioning to water heating, energy is a fundamental part of people’s lives. Access to reliable 
energy enables modern life and human progress.

Population and economic 
growth drive demand 
Population growth is one reason why 
ExxonMobil sees global energy demand 
rising by about 30 percent from 2010 to 2040. 
By 2040, there will be nearly 9 billion people 
on the planet, up from about 7 billion today. 

The world’s economies will continue to 
grow with varying rates. ExxonMobil esti-
mates OECD1 economies will expand about 
2 percent per year on average through 2040, 
as North America, Europe, and other regions 
gradually strengthen their economies. Non-
OECD economies will grow much faster: 
almost 4.5 percent per year. Signiﬁ cant 
energy efﬁ ciency gains across economies 
throughout the world will keep the pace of 
demand growth substantially lower than that 
of economic growth. OECD energy demand 
will ﬂ atten through 2040, while Non-OECD 
demand will rise by 60 percent and represent 
the vast majority of the increase in global 
energy use.

Evolving supply of energy sources 
to meet demand
Demand for all forms of energy is projected 
to rise at an average annual rate of 0.9 percent 

from 2010 to 2040. Oil and other liquid fuels 
will remain the world’s largest energy source 
in 2040, meeting about one-third of the 
demand. Substantial supply increases will 
come from sources such as global deepwater 
and oil sands production.

The fastest-growing major energy source will 
be natural gas, with global demand rising by 
about 60 percent from 2010 to 2040. By 2025, 
natural gas—which emits up to 60 percent 
less carbon dioxide (CO2) than coal when 
used for electricity generation—will have 
overtaken coal as the second most utilized 
fuel source after oil. 

Global demand for less carbon-intensive 
fuels—natural gas, nuclear, and renewables—
will rise at a faster-than-average rate. For 
example, nuclear power will grow about 
2.2 percent per year—a substantial increase, 
but lower than projections made before the 
2011 tsunami damage to the Fukushima 
nuclear plant in Japan.

Wind, solar, and biofuels also will see strong 
growth. By 2040, they will account for about 
4 percent of global demand. Wind is the 
fastest-growing energy source as projected 
in the Outlook, rising at about 8 percent per 
year on average through 2040.

1Refer to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) website for a listing of its members, oecd.org.

Meeting global transportation 
needs through liquid fuels
One of the most profound shifts in energy 
use through 2040 will come from the trans-
portation sector. The proliferation of more 
efﬁ cient vehicles will result in ﬂ attening energy 
demand for personal transportation, even as 
the number of personal vehicles in the world 
doubles to 1.6 billion, mostly from growth in 
China and other Non-OECD countries. 

In spite of this shift, economic growth will 
increase demand for trucks and heavy-duty 
vehicles. As a result, starting in 2030, these 
vehicles will use more fuel than all personal 
vehicles combined.

Overall, global energy demand for trans-
portation will rise by nearly 45 percent from 
2010 to 2040. In 2040, 90 percent of global 
transportation will run on liquid petroleum-
based fuels, compared to 95 percent today. 
This high percentage is driven by the fact 
that liquid fuels contain more energy per 
volume compared to other sources of energy 
used in vehicles.

Global demand for electricity 
surges
Utilities and other electricity produc-
ers transform different types of primary 
energy—everything from natural gas to coal 
to wind—into electricity used in homes and 
businesses. Global demand for electricity will 
rise by 80 percent from 2010 to 2040. As a 
result of greater efﬁ ciencies in power plants, 
demand for fuels to make that electricity will 
rise by only about 45 percent, mostly in China 
and other Non-OECD countries. Natural gas, 
nuclear, and renewables will see strong growth 
through 2040 as generators shift to lower-
carbon fuel sources globally. 

Efﬁ ciency gains slow the growth 
of energy-related CO2 emissions
ExxonMobil expects global energy-related 
emissions to level off by 2030, even as overall 
energy use continues to increase. This trend 
is the result of signiﬁ cant improvements in 
energy efﬁ ciency, plus shifts toward natural 
gas and other less carbon-intensive fuels, 
as efforts continue to manage the risks 
posed by rising greenhouse gas emissions. 
By 2040, OECD emissions of CO2 will be 
20 percent lower than in 2010, while Non-
OECD countries will account for more than 
70 percent of global CO2 emissions, com-
pared to 60 percent in 2010.

Providing solutions to advance 
human progress 
During the past 100 years, we have seen a 
dramatic change in the amount and nature 
of global energy use. Advances in technol-
ogy have played a huge role in shaping the 
demand for energy, and the types of supplies 
used to meet that demand. To help people 
prosper in the decades ahead, the world will 
need to expand supplies of reliable, afford-
able energy, while ensuring these supplies 
are provided in a safe, secure, and environ-
mentally responsible manner. The scale of 
this challenge is enormous, and we remain 
dedicated to ﬁ nding practical, broad-based 
solutions. To learn about ExxonMobil’s contri-
butions in these areas, see page 22.

Report Philosophy and Materiality 

As the world’s largest publicly traded oil and natural gas company, ExxonMobil’s primary role is to 
responsibly provide the energy needed to sustain and improve standards of living for people worldwide, 
while delivering a return to our shareholders. 

Our 2011 Corporate Citizenship Report 
presents a holistic picture of how opera-
tions integrity underpins our performance in 
key citizenship focus areas: Environmental 
Performance (page 12); Managing Climate 
Change Risks (page 22); Safety, Health, 
and the Workplace (page 26); Corporate 
Governance (page 32); Economic Development 
(page 38); and Human Rights and Managing 
Community Impacts (page 44). 

ExxonMobil is committed to addressing 
the challenge of sustainability—balancing 
economic growth, social development, and 
environmental protection so that future gener-
ations are not compromised by actions taken 
today. Our corporate citizenship approach is 
designed to contribute to society’s broader 
sustainability objectives and to manage the 
impact of our operations on local economies, 
societies, and the environment.

citizenship commitments into practice. 
Across our citizenship focus areas, we 
set high standards and strive to continu-
ously improve by measuring progress. Our 
company will continue to reach out and 
engage stakeholders as we responsibly 
conduct our business.

Reporting standards and scope
This report was produced in accordance with 
the reporting guidelines and indicators of the 
International Petroleum Industry Environmental 
Conservation Association (IPIECA) and the 
American Petroleum Institute (API) Oil and Gas 
Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability 
Reporting (2010). The majority of these indi-
cators are also consistent with the indicators 
used by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
in the G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 
(see our IPIECA/GRI index on page 50).

This report continues our annual practice 
of reporting on both our successes and 
challenges in delivering energy to meet 
growing demand while putting our corporate 

The report covers ExxonMobil’s operations 
through December 31, 2011, unless otherwise 
indicated. The report uses both qualitative 
descriptions and quantitative metrics to explain 

our policies, programs, and practices. For 
environmental performance data, the units 
of measure are metric where noted. Financial 
information is reported in U.S. dollars.

Exxon Mobil Corporation has numerous afﬁ li-
ates, with many names that include ExxonMobil, 
Exxon, Mobil, and Esso. For convenience and 
simplicity, those terms, and terms such as 
Corporation, company, our, we, us, and its, are 
sometimes used as abbreviated references to 
speciﬁ c afﬁ liates or afﬁ liate groups.

Assurance
We believe third-party assurance provides 
an objective evaluation of how well we 
report our corporate citizenship information 
and gives our reporting processes addi-
tional credibility. Lloyd’s Register Quality 
Assurance, Inc. (LRQA) conducts annual 
third-party assurance of ExxonMobil’s safety, 
health, and environment reporting system. 
For the full assurance statement, see the 
inside back cover of this report.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

ExxonMobil’s materiality analysis process identiﬁ es economic, environ-
mental, and social issues of particular interest and concern to both our 
stakeholders and business operations. Material issues may have a sig-
niﬁ cant current or future impact on our company. We identify issues of 
external signiﬁ cance by monitoring stakeholder expectations and con-
cerns through direct dialogue, public debate, legislation, international 
agreements, and feedback on our Corporate Citizenship Report. We 
also review international reporting standards and expectations, such 
as the United Nations Global Compact and Millennium Development 
Goals, to ensure a comprehensive, globally focused analysis. 

We determine priority issues by using a three-tiered review system 
that rates each issue based on its level of signiﬁ cance to stakeholder 
groups and its potential impact on our business objectives. Through 
this annual analysis, we can monitor recurring issues and identify 
emerging ones. We address all our Tier 1 and Tier 2 issues in the 
Corporate Citizenship Report. ExxonMobil’s senior management 
team reviews the results of our materiality analysis, which shapes 
the content of this report.

1. Identify issues of 
concern to ExxonMobil

Engagement

Our approach to corporate citizenship starts with engagement. ExxonMobil has a diverse group of 
stakeholders with interests in our business performance. While our views and perspectives may not 
always align, we are committed to engaging in constructive dialogue.

Effective stakeholder engagement depends 
upon relationships built on honest, timely, and 
transparent communication. We routinely meet 
with external stakeholders to help us identify 
issues most material to our business opera-
tions and to maintain our license to operate. 
The dialogue developed between ExxonMobil 
and our key stakeholders allows us to better 
align our ﬁ nancial, social, and environmental 
goals with the priorities of wider society. These 
discussions—and what we have learned from 
our stakeholders—help shape our approach.

We focus our worldwide engagement efforts 
on groups and individuals directly impacted 
by, or who have a direct impact on, our opera-
tions. Our engagement takes many forms, 
including internal and external one-on-one 
and group dialogues and brieﬁ ngs; senior 
executive speeches; quarterly earnings 
teleconferences; community consultation ses-
sions; email communications; our corporate 
blog exxonmobilperspectives.com; publi-
cations such as the Corporate Citizenship 
Report, Summary Annual Report, and The 

Lamp; and content on our website. Integrated 
throughout this report are examples of how 
we engage with stakeholders in each of our 
citizenship focus areas.

EXTERNAL CITIZENSHIP ADVISORY PANEL

In 2009, ExxonMobil created an External Assessment Panel to provide an 
independent review of our corporate citizenship reporting process. The 
panel reviewed and commented on the 2008, 2009, and 2010 Corporate 
Citizenship Reports. In 2011, the External Assessment Panel became 
the External Citizenship Advisory Panel (ECAP), with an expanded focus 
on providing strategic and objective advice on ExxonMobil’s corporate 
citizenship activities. The ECAP comprises ﬁ ve members with diverse 
backgrounds and experiences related to corporate responsibility.

In 2011, the ECAP visited ExxonMobil’s Irving, Texas, headquarters 
to discuss corporate citizenship performance and policies with our 
management. Panelists also visited our Joliet Reﬁ nery in Illinois to 
observe how our standards, processes, and programs are applied 
in our operations. The lessons learned from the ECAP’s visit to Joliet 
inspired the facility-level case studies in this Corporate Citizenship 
Report on oil sands development at Kearl (page 10) and integrated 
reﬁ ning and chemical manufacturing at Singapore (page 48). These 
case studies provide an inside look at the challenges and opportuni-
ties of operating in the energy industry.

ExxonMobil collects data on a wide range of indicators to track performance. We include indica-
tors consistent with the guidance provided by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental 
Conservation Association (IPIECA) and cross-referenced against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

We work to continually improve our performance 
across our citizenship focus areas. This means 
assessing performance at many levels of the 
organization, from our operational sites to the 
business lines. We provide data interpretations 
for where we consider the performance trend 
to be generally desirable (), undesirable (), 
or mixed () for applicable data. Performance 
data in the 2011 Corporate Citizenship Report 

include XTO Energy Inc. (XTO) information 
beginning in 2011. As a result, some of our his-
torical performance trends have been affected, 
as we describe in further detail within this report. 

economic climate. We conduct much of this 
detailed analysis at the operational level. Where 
we see unfavorable trends—at any level—we 
identify and aim to correct underlying causes.

For certain metrics, no interpretation is nec-
essary. For other metrics, we interpret trends 
based upon performance over a multiyear 
period and consider other factors in our 
assessments, such as production volumes and 

Interpreting our citizenship data regularly 
allows us to identify the performance issues 
that need the most attention. We describe in 
further detail within the text how we plan to 
address these issues.

Operations Integrity:
Developing Unconventional
Resources at Kearl

Meeting growing 
demand for energy 
requires signiﬁ -
cant investment in 
unconventional 
sources. At Kearl, 
our employees and 
contractors work 
hard to ensure 
ﬂ awless execu-
tion of our OIMS 
Framework. 

ExxonMobil’s Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) provides a top-to-bottom framework 
for addressing safety, security, health, environmental, and social risks in every aspect of our business—
from developing an oil sands project to selecting a supplier. This site tour illustrates operations 
integrity in an upstream project, including the challenges associated with oil sands development.

Overview of the Kearl oil 
sands project 
The oil sands in Canada contain the third 
largest oil reserves in the world after 
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The Kearl 
lease, covering 200 square kilometers 
and located 70 kilometers north of Fort 
McMurray in Alberta, contains among the 
largest and highest-quality of these deposits. 
ExxonMobil and its afﬁ liate Imperial Oil 
Limited are developing the Kearl project 
to recover an estimated 4.6 billion barrels 
of heavy oil called bitumen from what are 
commonly referred to as oil sands—natu-
rally occurring mixtures of water, sand, 
clay, and bitumen.

At Kearl, Imperial is constructing facilities 
to recover the bitumen, convert it to a 
marketable product, and send it via pipe-
line to reﬁ ning facilities to be transformed 
into energy and chemical products. Kearl’s 
deposits are close enough to the surface 
to be extracted efﬁ ciently using an open-
pit mining technique.

Production is planned to begin in late 2012 
with a rate near 110 thousand barrels of 
bitumen per day. Further expansion will bring 
the rate to 345 thousand barrels per day, 
with a more than 40-year project lifespan.

Environmental performance
OIMS Element 2—Risk Assessment and 
Management—requires the project to 
conduct risk assessments in order to 
identify and address potential hazards to 
personnel, facilities, the public, and the 
environment. Element 6—Operations and 
Maintenance—requires that we identify 
and manage signiﬁ cant environmental 
aspects as speciﬁ ed in an Environmental 
Impact Assessment and consistent with 
regulatory requirements.

The surface mining technique used at Kearl, 
along with its location in Alberta’s boreal 
forest, poses challenges that require careful 
environmental planning and management.

As part of the project planning phase, 
Imperial conducted a comprehensive 
Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Health 

Impact Assessment (ESHIA) that high-
lighted challenges in land management, 
environmental protection, and cultural 
heritage for indigenous people whose 
traditional lands overlie the Kearl lease 
area. Through the application of OIMS and 
to meet regulatory requirements, Imperial 
began progressively reclaiming land during 
early construction to ensure an ongoing 
and self-sustaining boreal forest. Kearl’s 
end-of-mine-life reclamation plans have 
been integrated with its neighbors’ plans 
to protect the surrounding watershed.

Although the project has not begun pro-
duction, Imperial has already permanently 
reclaimed 6.6 hectares of land with an 
additional 55 hectares undergoing pro-
gressive reclamation in the following areas:

Soil. As we mine, we salvage and store 
soil for reclamation. To date, we have 
stored more than 14 million cubic meters 
of usable soil. The tailings area, con-
structed to hold water, clay, and sand 
following processing, will eventually be 
reclaimed along with the mine site. 

Vegetation. Kearl participates in a regional 
seed collection program to grow native 
seedlings for planting during reclamation. 
Through participation in the vegeta-
tion cooperative, Imperial has already 
collected enough seeds to grow approxi-
mately 4 million trees and shrubs and has 
already planted more than 22,000. 

Wildlife. We protect wildlife near the 
development site by alerting employees 
to sensitive areas and enforcing speed 
limits on our roadways. Kearl also uses a 
state-of-the-art bird detection and deter-
rent system in the tailings and process 
areas to direct migratory birds away. 

Fisheries. A portion of the site’s develop-
ment disrupts ﬁ sh habitat. After extensive 
stakeholder consultation, Imperial is 
constructing the ﬁ rst of three lakes, each 
deeper than Kearl Lake, for ﬁ sh to winter. 
In addition, we are relocating ﬁ sh from exist-
ing habitat—totaling about 10,800 small ﬁ sh 
to date. 

Water use. Freshwater required for pro-
duction comes from the Athabasca River. 
Less than 4 percent of the river’s ﬂ ow is 
allocated to industrial users, with Kearl 
using under 0.5 percent. When in produc-
tion, we plan to maximize the recycling of 
processed water so that about 80 percent 
will be recycled water. Kearl will also have 
a three-month, on-site water storage facil-
ity to minimize water withdrawals during 
the winter low-ﬂ ow period.

In March 2012, Imperial, along with 
11 other major oil sands companies, 
plans to sign the Canadian Oil Sands 
Innovation Alliance (COSIA) in order to 
pursue enhanced collaboration in water 
use and treatment, tailings management, 
reclamation, and greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions reductions. 

Managing climate change risks
OIMS Element 6—Operations and 
Maintenance—requires the project to 
establish goals for environmental perfor-
mance, including GHGs. The project must 
identify alternatives, if applicable, and employ 
environmental improvement initiatives.

Some have voiced concerns regarding 
the potential GHG emissions associ-
ated with oil sands development. In fact, 
a September 2010 report by IHS CERA 
noted that “the average oil sands import 
to the United States has well-to-wheels 
life cycle GHG emissions about 6 percent 
higher than the average crude reﬁ ned in 
the United States.” A project designed 

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     11

like Kearl—using advanced mining tech-
niques, energy-saving cogeneration, and 
producing diluted bitumen without an 
upgrader—will result in about the same life 
cycle GHG emissions as many other oils. 

Technologies applied at Kearl could 
signiﬁ cantly reduce production-related 
emissions. We estimate that Kearl’s 
cogeneration facility will reduce carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions by half a million 
metric tons per year compared to 
purchased power for the ﬁ rst phase of 
the project. In order to create a pipeline-
ready product, Imperial will apply a 
proprietary parafﬁ nic froth treatment tech-
nology designed to remove enough of the 
asphaltenes and ﬁ ne solids to produce a 
crude oil suitable for sale, without needing 
an upgrader. Processing bitumen only 
once reduces life cycle GHG emissions.

Part of the engagement process includes 
establishing advisory committees with 
Aboriginal community residents. These 
committees allow for unﬁ ltered com-
munication and input from Aboriginal 
stakeholders. Site tours and quarterly 
meetings are also crucial to our continued 
engagement. Since 2008, Imperial has 
held about 24 meetings and eight site 
tours for community residents. 

Each of the ﬁ ve First Nations in the region 
also has a consultation ofﬁ ce called an 
Industry Relations Corporation (IRC), 
funded by companies working on oil 
sands developments in the region. The 
IRCs help review project details and relay 
feedback or concerns from First Nation 
people. Imperial has established Bilateral 
Agreements with four local Aboriginal 
communities. These agreements include

Human rights and managing 
community impacts
OIMS Element 10—Community Awareness 
and Emergency Preparedness—requires 
that the project seek, recognize, and 
address community expectations and 
concerns about our operations, including 
those of the workforce, in a timely manner. 

Under Canadian regulations, stakeholders 
are encouraged to participate in public 
interest hearings to share their opinions 
related to a project.

Kearl is located on the traditional lands of 
some of Canada’s indigenous peoples, col-
lectively referred to as Aboriginal peoples, a 
term used to describe Canada’s First Nation, 
Metis, and Inuit people. We developed 
Aboriginal Relations Guiding Principles and 
Guidelines and use a consultation protocol 
to ensure respectful consideration of 
Aboriginal peoples’ concerns. 

provisions for ﬁ nancial support to com-
munity projects, community input into 
project planning, as well as business and 
employment opportunities. 

Imperial consulted with the IRCs to 
develop a Reclamation Planning Group 
(RPG), which met four times in 2011. The 
RPG helped increase our understanding of 
the Aboriginal culture and its historic con-
nection to the land. Members of the RPG 
raised concerns during the reclamation 
planning process, and identiﬁ ed impor-
tant features of the reclaimed landscape. 
For example, the RPG provided input 
into plans for future use, asking that we 
include islands in a man-made lake upon 
which moose can protect their calves. 
Imperial is assessing this recommenda-
tion in future planning.

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     13

Energy development—critical to social and economic progress—requires careful environmental 
management. Across our diverse global operations, we are committed to ﬁ nding ways to continually
reduce environmental impacts. Our environmental stewardship processes are based on detailed 
analyses that include environmental and social aspect assessments and risk management. 

Environmental stewardship 
through responsible management
We believe that through careful environ-
mental management we gain a competitive 
advantage. ExxonMobil’s Operations Integrity 
Management System (OIMS) provides a 
structure for managing safety, security, 
health, environmental, and social risks. Using 
OIMS, we describe work processes, identify 
and mitigate risks, and develop critical proce-
dures. OIMS is consistent with the standard 
for environmental management systems 
established by the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO 14001:2004). Our 
Corporate Environment Policy and OIMS 
Framework set expectations that projects 
will be developed, constructed, and oper-
ated using approved standards that embody 
responsible development, especially in loca-
tions where regulations do not adequately 
protect the environment.

Our Protect Tomorrow. Today. initiative guides 
our management processes for maintain-
ing responsible environmental performance. 
Through the Environmental Business Planning 
process, our management drives environmental 
performance considerations into the full life 
cycle of our operations, from initial impact 
assessments to facility design and construction 
and through the operations phase. 

Assessing our surroundings. For new proj-
ects, we conduct risk-based Environmental, 
Socioeconomic, and Health Impact Assess-
ments (ESHIAs) to identify community 
concerns, environmental aspects, and social 
and economic conditions. For more informa-
tion on our ESHIA process, see page 18. 

Environmental standards. Our ExxonMobil 
Capital Projects Management System 
(EMCAPS) provides a framework to guide 
project development and execution. EMCAPS 
facilitates the consideration of environmen-
tal concerns and regulatory requirements 
early in the project design and implementa-
tion process. In addition, we are developing 
Project Environmental Standards for each of 
our business lines. 

While the focus areas for each business 
line’s standards vary depending on the type 
of project, we expect many business lines 
to adopt common standards. Our Upstream 
Environmental Standards address land 
use, marine geophysical operations, social 
and economic issues, waste management, 

drill cuttings management, water manage-
ment, air emissions, ﬂ aring and venting, and 
energy efﬁ ciency. Our L&S Standards of 
Environmental Care address spill risk minimi-
zation, energy management, and greenhouse 
gas and other emissions reductions. We 
trained selected employees in the Upstream 
and L&S businesses on these Standards 
through 2011, and plan to continue this effort. 
These employees have diverse roles—from 
environmental and regulatory advisors to 
managers and construction environmental 
engineers—ensuring broad distribution of 
knowledge about the Standards across the 
upstream and L&S companies. 

Data management. To meet increasing 
expectations from government agencies 
for timely, accurate, and auditable data; to 
stay ahead of regulatory reporting require-
ments; and to enable communication to 
our stakeholders and communities; we 
began implementing an environmental data 
management system (EDMS) in 2008. At 
the corporate level, we use EDMS to collect, 
collate, and consolidate site-level data to 
help manage our environmental performance 
indicators globally. At each site, EDMS 
integrates with existing emissions monitor-
ing and measurement systems to allow us to 
collect up-to-date, site-speciﬁ c information. 
We are deploying EDMS across our major 
operational sites, and several manufacturing 
and production sites already have air, water, 
waste, and compliance modules in place. 

Biodiversity and ecosystem 
services
ExxonMobil uses a systematic approach 
for protecting biodiversity and ecosystem 
services that recognizes factors such as the 
rarity of individual species, their habitats, their 
vulnerability, and cultural value. Ecosystem 
services are deﬁ ned as the direct and indirect 
beneﬁ ts people obtain from the environ-
ment. They include, for example, food, water, 
recreation, and climate regulation. Preserving 
the ability of the environment to provide these 
important ecosystem services is a key environ-
mental risk management area for ExxonMobil. 
To protect critical ecosystem functions and 
sensitive habitats, we take steps such as 
modifying engineering design, construction, 
and operating practices, and enhancing wild-
life habitats on or near our properties. We also 
support advocacy, research, and partnerships 
to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services 
outside our fence line. 

We identify biodiversity protection objec-
tives and consider ecosystem services 
and exploration activity through our ESHIA 
process, the preparation of Environmental 
Management Plans, and our Environmental 
Business Planning efforts. Through participa-
tion in Business for Social Responsibility’s 
Ecosystem Services Tools and Markets 
(ESTM) working group, we interface with 
many industry peers on important ecosystem 
service topics. Our involvement with ESTM 
helps us to better understand emerging 
policy and technical issues related to biodi-
versity and ecosystem services.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Community relationships in Baton Rouge, Louisiana

Our Baton Rouge, Louisiana, site is an integrated reﬁ nery and petrochemical facility, with 
several smaller chemical plants and a lubricants facility in close proximity. Working with the 
communities surrounding the Baton Rouge site is an important part of maintaining our social 
license to operate. We engage the community through our ExxonMobil Community Dialogue 
and Partnership Panel that regularly meets to provide candid feedback to local ExxonMobil 
management about neighborhood concerns. We publish a quarterly newsletter to address 
ﬂ aring and aquifer use, publicize community outreach projects, and share our annual 
environmental performance report. We also provide employee-led plant tours for student 
groups and hold site tours and operational brieﬁ ngs for local and state leaders, government 
ofﬁ cials, and the media. Community members can access updated information on current 
operations every day of the year through a dedicated information phone line. 

Because of our employees’ efforts related to local wildlife conservation, the Baton Rouge 
complex was named the 2010 Conservation Corporation of the Year by the Governor’s 
Conservation Achievement Recognition Program, overseen by the Louisiana Wildlife Federation. 

14     exxonmobil.com

In 2011, we screened our major sites against 
databases of the International Union for 
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and World 
Protected Areas. We conﬁ rmed that less 
than 20 percent of our 115 major Upstream, 
Downstream, and Chemical facilities are 
within 5 kilometers of designated environ-
mentally protected areas. 

At each of these sites, we re-examined our 
existing environmental management practices to 
ensure the environmental protection measures 
adequately safeguard nearby protected areas. 
For example, land surrounding our Slagen, 
Norway, reﬁ nery has at least 30 IUCN-listed 
species present. To ensure future utilization of 
these areas and adequate species protection, 
we conducted a biological characterization 

study of the 130 hectares of company-owned 
coastal forest and developed a corresponding 
ecological management plan. We are in the 
process of ﬁ nalizing this management plan.

of cleaner-burning natural gas are well-recog-
nized. We believe it is in everyone’s interest 
to respond effectively to public concerns 
over unconventional resource development in 
order to maximize the beneﬁ ts of this energy 
source. This requires industry both to properly 
manage associated risks, and to explain to the 
public and policymakers how we are doing so. 

Identifying and managing risk. All indus-
trial processes have risks, and drilling for 
unconventional oil and gas is no different. The 
technical and environmental risks associ-
ated with drilling an unconventional well 
onshore are low compared to other forms of 
energy production. Today’s unconventional 
resources are located almost exclusively 
onshore. As a result, the local and cumu-
lative risks and impacts associated with 
unconventional oil and gas development may 
affect large, often densely populated areas. 
We understand stakeholders are concerned 
about these risks, including those related to 
hydraulic fracturing ﬂ uids and wastewater, 
well casing and groundwater, vehicle trafﬁ c, 
air emissions, and other related effects. 
These are important concerns, and we know 
we must respond to them in every community 
in which we operate and reach out to commu-
nities to ensure our responses are effective.

ExxonMobil has extensive experience in 
identifying and analyzing risks in all types of 
oil and gas production operations, and estab-
lishing preventive practices and processes 
to manage and mitigate them. We analyze 
every signiﬁ cant operation the Corporation 
undertakes through our Operations Integrity 
Management System (OIMS). Applying 
OIMS requires us to identify potential safety, 
environmental, and social impacts and to 
implement procedures and processes to 
mitigate risks. XTO Energy Inc. (XTO), a 
recently acquired subsidiary of ExxonMobil, 
will fully implement OIMS, and is carrying out 
a risk-based, focused, and deliberate execu-
tion strategy.

Effective risk management is one means of 
addressing stakeholder concerns surround-
ing unconventional resource development. 

For example, our standard procedures and 
processes include designing well pads to 
contain accidental spills, installing multiple 
layers of steel pipe and cement to protect 
groundwater and other aquifers, and develop-
ing stringent surface water management and 
wastewater disposal practices. Additionally, 
our technology allows us to reduce surface 
impacts by drilling multiple horizontal wells—
sometimes thousands of feet through under-
ground shale, all from a single well pad. 

Seismicity associated with unconventional 
resource development is a relatively new 
concern gaining public attention. There 
have been a few cases where the deep 
underground injection of wastewater for 
disposal purposes has been associated with 
seismicity. None of these were associ-
ated with ExxonMobil’s wells. There are 
thousands of permitted class II injection 
wells around the United States with very few 
being investigated for association with low 
level seismicity. Our geophysicists and other 
experts are engaged in discussions with 
others in industry and regulatory ofﬁ cials to 
better understand the subsurface impact 
of oil and gas operations and address the 
underlying causes of these events.

All our shale gas development and produc-
tion activities are guided by proven policies, 
industry guidelines and practices, as well as 
more than 40 years of experience in hydraulic 
fracturing. A wide variety of publicly available 
information discusses the systems and pro-
cedures we have employed to manage these 
risks, including the ExxonMobil-sponsored 
aboutnaturalgas.com website.

Key public policy issues. ExxonMobil 
chairs the American Petroleum Institute 
working group that has developed four 
recommended practice documents encom-
passing the life cycle of unconventional 
resource development. In the United States, 
we work with state governments and multi-
state entities to address concerns, establish 
effective regulatory frameworks, and 
implement industry consensus on sound 
management practices. 

Concerns about hydraulic fracturing are 
not conﬁ ned to the United States. In 2008, 
ExxonMobil started evaluating potential 
unconventional natural gas resources in 
Germany and elsewhere in Europe. In response 
to stakeholder concerns, ExxonMobil con-
ducted an information and dialogue process 
for maximum transparency. Two indepen-
dent facilitators brought in well-recognized 
scientists to conduct independent research 
and answer stakeholder questions related to 
the safety and environmental sustainability of 
the drilling process and fracturing technology. 
We will continue to engage with stakehold-
ers in Europe and other regions where we are 
seeking to develop unconventional resources.

A vital component of building community 
trust is transparency of operations. We 
support the disclosure of the ingredients 
used in hydraulic fracturing ﬂ uids, including 
on a site-speciﬁ c basis. In the United States, 
disclosure appears on the publicly accessible 
FracFocus.org website, an effort between 
the Ground Water Protection Council and the 
Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. 
Launched in April 2011, ExxonMobil and 
others in industry have voluntarily submitted 
actual data from more than 10,000 wells. In 
Canada, the public can access FracFocus.ca 
for industry disclosures in British Columbia, 
with Alberta and Saskatchewan planned for 
late 2012. We are pursuing similar disclosure 
approaches in Europe and other areas where 
we are exploring internationally.

Ongoing commitment. We recognize that 
the scale and growth of unconventional 
resource development continues to prompt 
signiﬁ cant questions among stakeholders. 
ExxonMobil has drilled nearly 900 uncon-
ventional resource wells this year, and we 
are one of many operators bringing this 
resource to market. We will continue to take 
a leadership role in working collaboratively 
with communities, regulators, and indus-
try associations to manage operational 
risk and address questions and concerns. 
ExxonMobil recognizes the importance of 
responsible operations in maintaining stake-
holder support for this signiﬁ cant resource.

implementing a Biodiversity Strategy to meet 
the project’s deﬁ ned biodiversity objectives. 
Part of the Biodiversity Strategy involves the 
implementation of biodiversity offsets. In 
collaboration with Conservation International, 
a nonproﬁ t organization with expertise in 
environmental and conservation practices, 
and in consultation with local organizations 
and experts, we are developing recommen-
dations for implementing a Biodiversity Offset 
Delivery Plan. Through this plan, we will seek 
to conserve land in particularly sensitive loca-
tions to safeguard and promote stewardship 
of local biodiversity. The PNG LNG project is 
in the construction phase, and will eventually 
include gas production and processing facili-
ties, liquefaction and storage facilities, and 
nearly 700 kilometers of connecting pipelines. 
Offsets will generally consist of conservation 
programs implemented by a local community 
and will involve various Papua New Guinea 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and 
the government. 

By the end of 2011, we had more than 
2700 hectares of land being actively managed 
for the beneﬁ t of wildlife at 18 ExxonMobil 
sites, compared with 140 hectares in 2009. 
Protecting and enhancing wildlife habitat 
on our properties is a strategic element of 
our broader corporate biodiversity manage-
ment approach. ExxonMobil is proud to be 
a charter member of the Wildlife Habitat 
Council (WHC) since its establishment in 
1988 and we partner with the WHC to certify 
ExxonMobil locations for conservation. We 
have identiﬁ ed several sites for WHC certi-
ﬁ cation in 2012, including many outside the 
United States. This past year, we established 
a WHC Site Coordinators working group 
to share knowledge on program sustain-
ment activities, local relationships, and site 
certiﬁ cations. The active participation and 
engagement of our employees is instrumental 
in the success of our on-site wildlife habitat 
conservation efforts. For example, employees 
at our ExxonMobil Chemical global head-
quarters in Houston, Texas, a certiﬁ ed Wildlife 
Habitat site since 2010, learned of owls 
threatened by record droughts in the area. 
A volunteer team coordinated with the Wildlife 
Center of Texas to build an enclosure on the 
14-hectare property and reintroduce owls 
into the environment. So far, 11 owls have 
been successfully rescued, tagged for future 
monitoring, and released. 

In Shanghai, 84 ExxonMobil volunteers have 
helped to re-establish local wetlands. Since 
2010, they have contributed more than 
1300 hours during their weekends and holi-
days to help support this key ecosystem. 
Part of this effort involves training other local 
volunteers and students on the importance of 
preserving wetland ecology and biodiversity. 

In Slagen, Norway, two scientists assess biodiversity in the area surrounding the facility during a biological 
characterization study. Understanding the local biodiversity of an area helps us to manage our operations 
and develop and implement protection measures. 

We seek to engage NGOs on conservation 
projects in key countries and near operat-
ing sites, particularly to partner with them to 
implement speciﬁ c programs with measur-
able, scientiﬁ c results. In 2011, ExxonMobil 
contributed more than $2 million to organiza-
tions dedicated to biodiversity protection and 
land conservation. We also support organiza-
tions focused on improving the quality and 
quantity of species data, such as the United 
Nations World Conservation Monitoring 
Centre, so that we can enhance our environ-
mental planning and protection efforts. 

Freshwater management 
The oil and gas industry requires water, 
including freshwater, in its operations. We 
use water in the extraction, processing and 
reﬁ ning of hydrocarbons, and for cooling 
associated with electricity generation at our 
facilities. As part of our project planning, 
we assess the impact of our activities on 
water availability and demand. We use a wide 
range of approaches to reduce water use and 
preserve water quality through on-site recy-
cling and water reuse, purchasing treated 
wastewater for use as process water, employ-
ing processes to decrease water needs, and 
appropriately treating wastewater streams 
prior to their discharge.

In 2011, the net freshwater consumption 
at our operations was 2342 million barrels, 
representing a 9 percent increase from 2010. 
We actively manage our water consumption 
and seek opportunities to reduce, reuse, 
and recycle water in our operations. For 
example, our Torrance, California, reﬁ nery 
purchases and uses recycled wastewater 
from a local municipal treatment plant for 
cooling tower makeup and boiler feed water, 
representing nearly 70 percent of total water 
consumption at this facility. In our heavy oil 
operations at Cold Lake, Canada, we use a 
variety of water-use-reduction measures, 

and about 85 percent of water use on-site 
is treated, recycled water produced with 
heavy oil.

In 2011, we used the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) 
global water tool to identify regions where 
we operate that may have water scarcity 
concerns. Information on water stress and 
scarcity in the vicinity of our operations 
serves as an important part of risk manage-
ment. Of our 115 major operating sites, we 
identiﬁ ed about 25 percent operating in 
regions that may have some degree of water 
stress or scarcity. These areas are located in 
15 countries. 

In 2011, our upstream companies introduced 
a process to enhance water management. 
Since then, the quantity and quality of water 
use data have been signiﬁ cantly improved 
and a water footprinting strategy has been 
instituted to better analyze our interac-
tions with local water resources. In 2012, 
our major sites plan to review their water 
consumption rates to identify opportunities 
for responsible use. Those sites located in 
scarce or stressed regions plan to update 
their Environmental Business Plans to ensure 
effective water resource management.

There are a variety of projects in progress to 
reduce water consumption. Our King Ranch 
Gas Plant in Texas is planning a water recy-
cling system using reverse osmosis to treat 
water for on-site reuse. This will signiﬁ cantly 
reduce water use and almost completely 
eliminate liquid efﬂ uent from the plant. 

We believe engaging our peers on water 
management issues can improve overall 
petroleum industry performance. In 2011, we 
helped develop the Global Environmental 
Management Initiative Local Water Tool, 
which allows sites to identify and rank risks 
associated with the availability and reliability 
of water sources and wastewater discharge

points. We piloted the tool at four of our sites 
and anticipate using the ﬁ nal version in 2012. 
Pilot sites found the tool useful in identifying 
potential risks, which we plan to address using 
management tools such as Environmental 
Business Plans. We also supported efforts 
to customize a version of the WBCSD global 
water tool speciﬁ cally for the oil and gas 
industry in collaboration with the International 
Petroleum Industry Environmental Conser-
vation Association (IPIECA). 

Spill performance
The BP Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010 
reafﬁ rmed the importance of continually 
developing and improving risk manage-
ment, operations integrity, spill prevention 
processes, and containment capabilities. 
Our own spill prevention programs seek to 
strengthen procedures, build in layers of 
protection, inspect and maintain equipment, 
train operators, and conduct tests and drills. 

Unfortunately, in 2011, we did not meet 
our expectation of continued improvement 
regarding spill performance. A pipeline 
breach in Montana resulted in an estimated 
1509 barrels of oil being released into the 
Yellowstone River (page 28). This incident 
brought the total volume of hydrocarbons 
spilled to land or water in 2011 to about 
18 thousand barrels, with nearly 75 percent 
recovered at the site of the spill. The number 
of nonmarine hydrocarbon spills greater 
than 1 barrel in 2011 was 73 percent higher 
than in 2007 and 108 percent higher than 2010.

XTO is already beneﬁ ting from the implementa-
tion of OIMS and incorporation of ExxonMobil’s 
best practices in environmental manage-
ment. The total volume spilled by XTO was 
58 percent lower in 2011 compared to 2010. 

In 2011, we continued our implementation of 
the downstream Global Human Factors Best 
Practice Guide in order to instill a zero-spill 
mindset across ExxonMobil. The Guide out-
lines 17 high-risk elements and corresponding 
procedures to reduce the likelihood of a 
human-caused spill. This initiative is helping 
us effectively address reﬁ nery spills caused 
by human factors, which are down more than 
40 percent over the past four years. We are 
also using a specialized risk tool to identify 
infrastructure in need of upgrades to help us 
further avoid spills. We are focusing in 2012 on 
improvement measures at those reﬁ ning sites 
with the highest spill rates. 

Marine vessel spill performance. During 
2011, vessels owned and operated by 
ExxonMobil’s marine afﬁ liates surpassed 
more than ﬁ ve years without any spills to water 
greater than 1 barrel. There were no spills 
from long-term chartered ships in 2011. This 
marine ﬂ eet of more than 650 vessels in daily 
service logged 25,000 voyages in 2011 and 
safely transported more than 1.8 billion barrels 
of crude oil and reﬁ ned products globally. 

Technological innovation in oil spill response. 
The ﬁ rst component of protecting the 
environment during offshore production is 
preventing spills from happening. In order 
to be prepared in case a spill occurs, we 
are working to make efﬁ cient containment 
equipment and dispersants readily available. 

PROTECTING WESTERN GRAY WHALES

Working in close cooperation with Russian 
scientiﬁ c institutes afﬁ liated with the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, our scientists have 
researched western gray whales since 1997. 
This successful research and monitoring 
program has provided improved under-
standing of the ecology of the population. 
During the course of research, western 
gray whales in the vicinity of Sakhalin Island 
have been monitored, photographed, and 
catalogued. 

The important summer feeding grounds 
for these endangered marine mammals are 
along the northeastern shore of Russia’s 
Sakhalin Island, near where we operate an 
offshore production platform and plan to 
install a second in 2012. To safeguard the 
whales’ feeding grounds, we follow strict 
criteria based both on published science 

and our own research ﬁ ndings. These 
studies provide information about the level 
of noise produced by shoreline or offshore 
operations, and the potential of that noise 
to propagate into feeding areas. These 
levels are compared with published thresh-
olds, and we take appropriate actions to 
minimize disturbances to the whales. When 
we conduct work offshore, we also employ 
experts to observe the whales; protocols 
are in place to modify or suspend work if 
these experts determine that the whales are 
potentially at risk from our activities. These 
efforts, combined with scientiﬁ c knowledge 
of the individual animals and population 
monitoring, have demonstrated that this 
fragile population continues to grow. In 
2000, there were around 100 whales; today 
there are more than 130.

ExxonMobil has partnered with several 
companies to form the nonproﬁ t Marine Well 
Containment Company (MWCC) to develop a 
rapid-response oil spill containment system 
for the Gulf of Mexico. The system involves a 
more than $1 billion combined commitment 
on behalf of the member companies and 
provides pre-engineered, constructed, and 
tested containment technology and equip-
ment deployable within 24 hours of a spill 
in the Gulf. A team of marine, subsea, and 
construction engineers led by ExxonMobil 
is designing and constructing expanded 
system components that will enhance current 
containment capabilities. This specially 
designed subsea containment equipment will 
be usable at depths of up to 10,000 feet and 
is designed to capture up to 100 thousand 
barrels of oil per day. The captured oil will 
be sent to vessels that can safely process, 
store, and ofﬂ oad it. 

To enhance spill response capabilities, 
ExxonMobil’s researchers have recently 
developed a new dispersant gel, capable of 
treating oil with two-thirds less dispersant 
than other formulas. We expect this product 
to be ready for commercial sale by the end 
of 2012. Globally, we are engaged in efforts 
through the International Association of Oil 
and Gas Producers and IPIECA to improve 
industry capability in this area.

Emissions and waste
We continue to seek opportunities to reduce 
the environmental impacts from our opera-
tions by reducing air emissions and the 
generation of waste. 

Air emissions. In 2011, our combined 
emissions of volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) increased by 5 percent from 
2010 but decreased 26 percent from 2007 
levels. By year-end 2011, our U.S. reﬁ ning 
facilities reduced combined NOx and SO2 
emissions by more than 35 percent from 
2000 levels. Since 2007, our global chemical 
operations have reduced VOC emissions by 
25 percent and NOx emissions by 8 percent. 

For example, at our chemical plant in Notre 
Dame de Gravenchon, France, we optimized 
our processes and reduced VOC emissions by 
approximately 150 metric tons per year. 

ExxonMobil is co-sponsoring an inter-
disciplinary ﬁ ve-year research program, 
coordinated by the Health Effects Institute, 
focused on determining which particulate 
constituents have the most signiﬁ cant health 
impacts. Research ﬁ ndings will be used to 
develop more cost-effective emission control 
strategies targeting those particles with the 
highest public health concern. Results from 
individual sub-studies will be released in 
2012, with a ﬁ nal report of the overall results 
expected in 2013. We plan to monitor and 
evaluate the results as they become available. 
Greenhouse gas emissions and ﬂ aring are 
discussed in the Managing Climate Change 
Risks section of this report (see page 22).

Waste management. Our ﬁ rst waste manage-
ment priority is to minimize its generation, 
then to reuse or recycle it wherever possible. 
In 2011, ExxonMobil and its wholly owned 
subsidiary SeaRiver Maritime sold the S/R 
Wilmington to a U.S. ship-recycling facility 
for dismantling that will maximize material 
recovery and ensure the proper handling and 
disposal of materials. The watchdog organiza-
tion Basel Action Network lauded our action 
to recycle the Wilmington. 

In 2011, we disposed of 1.9 million metric tons 
of hazardous waste from our ongoing opera-
tions. Of this amount, 1.7 million metric tons 
was produced water, which is classiﬁ ed as a 
hazardous waste by only one local authority. 
Excluding produced water brought to the 
surface during oil and gas production, we 
reused or recycled about 50 percent of the 
hazardous waste generated by our opera-
tions. Where appropriate, produced water 
may be re-injected using deep disposal wells 
or discharged offshore after having ﬁ rst been 
treated to remove residual oil. Our Tulare, 
California, facility is building a system to 
ﬁ lter and soften produced water for reuse as 
feed water to a steam generator. Much of our 
reported hazardous waste from remediation 

ARCTIC OFFSHORE DRILLING AND EXPLORATION

During 2011, we entered into an agreement 
with the Russian oil company Rosneft to 
jointly explore for and produce oil in Russia, 
the United States, and other parts of the 
world. During the past 15 years, we have part-
nered with Rosneft in the implementation of 
our Sakhalin-1 project, producing hundreds 
of millions of barrels of oil for export to world 
markets. Russia offers promising prospects 
for new oil and natural gas discoveries, 

recognizing that much of its endowment is 
relatively unexplored or located in challeng-
ing environments. As we identify possible 
projects with Rosneft, we will apply our nearly 
90 years of technical expertise in the Arctic 
to protect the Russian North’s fragile environ-
ment and sensitive ecology. For example, 
ExxonMobil is maintaining a leadership 
role in the Arctic Response Technology—
Joint Industry Program. The program was 

established by nine oil and gas companies 
with more than $20 million in initial research 
on key safety, health, and environment topics 
such as oil spill prevention and response 
in ice and Arctic environments. Together, 
ExxonMobil and Rosneft will also establish 
the Arctic Research and Design Center for 
Offshore Development, with a mandate to 
develop new technologies to enable oil and 
gas exploration and production in the Arctic.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIOECONOMIC, AND HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENTS ( ESHIAs)

At ExxonMobil, risk management shapes 
our business and investment decisions. This 
includes evaluating and managing the risks 
and opportunities related to social, health, 
environmental, economic, and cultural matters. 
When starting major upstream projects, we 
conduct an ESHIA to identify key risks that 
could be encountered throughout the asset 
life cycle and develop strategies to appropri-
ately manage these risks. ESHIAs are on the 
critical path of most project schedules since 
their submission and approval are often tied 
to the issuance of major permits or approvals. 
ESHIAs are an extensive analysis and require 
thorough observation of natural and social 
environments, often over many seasons. 

We typically contract independent consulting 
ﬁ rms to conduct ESHIAs on our behalf, which 
provides an important impartial perspective 
and helps foster credible and productive 
relationships with external stakeholders. 

A key aspect of conducting an ESHIA 
involves engaging directly with affected com-
munities, relevant governmental agencies, 
international organizations, and local NGOs 
in order to solicit feedback on a project and 
gain information that can be used to improve 
the project or its execution. As part of the 
process, stakeholders are given the oppor-
tunity to review and comment on ESHIA 
drafts. Detailed literature surveys, scientiﬁ c 
studies, technical evaluations, and socio-
economic analyses are key activities that 

require signiﬁ cant ﬁ eld time. Socioeconomic 
analyses include indigenous peoples 
considerations (if applicable), demo-
graphic evaluations, way of life analyses, 
and cultural heritage determinations. The 
results of an ESHIA inform our project-based 
decision-making, allowing us to develop 
execution plans to better manage key 
environmental, socioeconomic, and health 
risks. We document, monitor, evaluate, and 
plan implementation through the life cycle of 
a project to determine the effectiveness of 
risk management approaches coupled with 
continuous improvement feedback loops. 

We apply an “avoid, mitigate, compensate” 
strategy to address potential risks identiﬁ ed 
through an ESHIA. Our goal is to manage 
risks to a level as low as practicable. This 
hierarchical approach ensures that we ﬁ rst 
consider modifying aspects of the project 
design or execution plan to avoid an impact. 
For example, in response to an ESHIA con-
ducted for an Arctic development project, 
we timed the shipping of various pieces 
of equipment to the work site to avoid the 
traditional whale-hunting period of the local 
indigenous people. For another project in 
northern Canada, we re-routed a roadway to 
avoid disrupting a natural topographic feature 
that has signiﬁ cant cultural importance to 
the local indigenous people. Examples of 
mitigation include instituting erosion control 
measures on pipeline easements, employ-
ing prudent waste management procedures, 

instituting a “no hiring at the gate” policy to 
inhibit in-migration in the vicinity of worksites 
and facilities, and breaking apart large goods 
and services procurement contracts so that 
local suppliers are better able to compete.

In Alaska, we adjusted our project plans in 
consideration of local traditions, including 
modifying lighting on the pads to reduce 
visibility, texturing and coating the pipe-
lines to mitigate glare, rounding corners 
on gravel pads to reduce their impact on 
caribou movement, and building pipelines 
at a minimum of 2 meters above the tundra 
to allow caribou and hunters to pass. We 
also designed the export pipeline and gath-
ering lines to withstand accidental bullet 
strikes from subsistence coastal hunting. 

In some situations, compensation may be the 
most practical solution. We offer monetary and 
other types of compensation to account for the 
project-related loss of a resource, attribute, or 
possession. For more information please see 
our Human Rights and Managing Community 
Impacts section (page 44). Since 2007, 
ExxonMobil has undertaken or participated in 
nearly 100 ESHIAs for projects and activities 
around the world, ranging from single well 
exploration drilling programs and new technol-
ogy evaluation pilots to large development 
mega-projects. Conducting ESHIAs is 
integral to successful project execution and 
to developing long-term, positive relationships 
in the communities where we operate. 

ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
SOCIAL MANAGEMENT 
PROCESS 

When beginning major projects, 
we undertake an ESHIA, starting 
with identifying aspects—such 
as roads, pipelines, or equip-
ment—that could interact with 
the natural and social envi-
ronment, conducting a risk 
assessment, and developing 
strategies to avoid or manage 
those risks. Conducting an 
ESHIA is one key activity in this 
iterative process, which contin-
ues throughout the life cycle of 
an asset.

generated approximately 1.3 million metric 
tons of hazardous waste.

Compliance record. Our worldwide environ-
mental expenditures in 2011 totaled about 
$4.9 billion. This included about $1.6 billion 
in capital expenditures and about $3.3 billion 
in operating expenses. In 2011, 65 ﬁ nes and

2011, ExxonMobil was involved in litigation in 
Maryland related to an accidental underground 
leak at one of our company-owned, dealer-
operated gasoline stations. The company has 
paid $50 million in cleanup costs and in 2008 
paid $4 million in environmental penalties.

hinges on the ability to efﬁ ciently remedi-
ate and reclaim sites. We use a consistent 
approach that leverages ExxonMobil’s 
remediation best practices globally. 

The ExxonMobil Environmental Services 
(EMES) functional organization remediates 
contaminated soil and groundwater at operat-
ing facilities, inactive properties, and formerly 
owned sites. EMES works to enhance asset 
and community value and also supports new 
business development, while creating oppor-
tunities for reuse of inactive properties. 
In 2011, EMES stewarded approximately 
9500 active site remediation projects world-
wide. We devoted more than 5.2 million 
work hours to remediation and reclamation 
activities, including the disposition of approxi-
mately 405 hectares for beneﬁ cial reuse. 

Early and continued engagement with 
local communities and regulatory authori-
ties is an EMES basic practice. Due to a 
series of historical mergers and acquisi-
tions, ExxonMobil’s afﬁ liate, ExxonMobil Oil 
Corporation, inherited the responsibility for 
certain operations of the Virginia Carolina 
Chemical Corporation (VCC), and is working 
cooperatively with the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) to remediate a 
number of former VCC properties pursuant 
to U.S. environmental laws. The EPA initially 
identiﬁ ed 24 properties requiring investiga-
tion and possible remediation due to elevated 
levels of lead and arsenic, but we proactively 
assessed additional VCC properties for con-
tamination, expanding the targeted site list to 
38 properties. Working in cooperation with 
the EPA and state regulators, we have already 
remediated approximately 55 hectares, 
or about 62 percent, and have completed 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Collaborating on remediation best practices

In 2011, the EPA honored ExxonMobil with an invitation to present its VCC site remediation 
program at the agency’s Community Involvement Training Conference. The workshop is 
held every other year to identify best practices in engaging communities about environ-
mental issues. Our approach consisted of meeting directly with property owners and 
conducting town hall meetings. We also worked on projects to improve common space 
areas like playgrounds for neighborhood children. 

“The VCC projects have enhanced ExxonMobil’s relationship with the EPA. It’s apparent 
from the start of each project that we have a mutual understanding not only of our remedia-
tion goals, but also of our objectives when engaging with the various communities.”

-Lauren Gordon, EMES Project Manager

“The success of the VCC projects stems from the cooperation between EPA and ExxonMobil. 
Our close collaboration enabled us to approach each site uniquely, identify the needs of the 
community, and address any concerns residents had about the remediation work.”

-Stephanie Yvette Brown, EPA Region 4

investigation or developed action plans for 
the majority of the VCC properties. While our 
remediation activities do not alter the current 
use of the properties, the remediated sites 
can have a variety of end-use applications. 

In Germany, ExxonMobil performed a reme-
diation assessment at an 18-hectare former 
manufacturing site along the Elbe River in 
the city of Wedel. Operations at the site 
dated back to the early 1900s. The City was 
interested in integrating the property into part 
of its strategic planning. We negotiated and 
agreed that the City of Wedel could purchase 
the property. This mutually beneﬁ cial solution 
allowed for the productive use of the property 
for the good of the local economy. 

Land conservation. Through the application 
of natural land management strategies and 
proactive stakeholder engagement, EMES 
continues to conserve inactive properties. 
In Fredericksburg, Virginia, we success-
fully implemented a voluntary conservation 
easement on a portion of surplus property 
along the Rappahannock River. Working with 
the Northern Virginia Conservation Trust, 
a member of the Land Trust Alliance (LTA), 
conservation values—including enhance-
ment of the water quality of the river and the 
Chesapeake Bay—will be preserved and 
protected for the long term. On Long Island, 
New York, ExxonMobil continues to advance 
the preservation of coastal habitat within 
the boundaries of two former fuel storage 
terminal sites whose operations date back 
to the early 1900s. In cooperation with local 
conservation organizations, we are making 
progress toward land conservation of these 
ecologically valuable properties.

CASE STUDY

Technology

Technological advancements allow ExxonMobil to drive continuous improvement in mitigating the 
environmental and safety risks associated with energy development. 

ExxonMobil’s commitment to invest in technol-
ogy enables us to develop innovative solutions 
to improve safety, minimize environmental 
impact, and maximize resource value. We have 
invested approximately $8 billion in research 
and development (R&D) during the past 10 
years, and almost $2 billion on technologies 
related to safety and the environment. Our 
process for evaluating technology for devel-
opment and commercialization is guided by 
the business lines’ long-term commitment 
to continuous improvement in operations 
integrity as formalized in our Operations 
Integrity Management System (OIMS) and 
by the opportunity technology presents to 
lower energy use, maximize resource value, 
enhance our product offering, and contribute 
to competitive advantage.

Strategic technology 
development
At the core of our business are several key 
research organizations that work collab-
oratively on new technologies. ExxonMobil 
recently established a corporate-level 
Emerging Energy Sources and Technologies 
team (EMEST), tasked with evaluating 
technologies either over long time hori-
zons, or in ﬁ elds outside the company’s 
near-term business focus. Once EMEST 
determines that a technology is scalable 
from an energy supply-demand perspec-
tive, ﬁ ts with ExxonMobil competencies, and 

could provide the Corporation a competitive 
advantage or support its license to operate, 
the team can elect to evaluate or progress 
the technology in a functional R&D program.

In addition to corporate-level research, 
functional technology groups support each 
of the business lines in guiding their technol-
ogy investment. For example, ExxonMobil’s 
upstream research afﬁ liate ExxonMobil 
Research Qatar (EMRQ) is developing a 
remote gas detection system that pairs 
infrared camera technology with a sophisti-
cated algorithm that detects hydrocarbons. 
When deployed, remote gas detection ( 1 )
will improve process safety and reduce 
hydrocarbon emissions by identifying leaks 
quickly and automatically. 

Downstream Research & Engineering con-
tinually works on process enhancements 
to reduce ﬂ aring and associated emis-
sions. We also invest in new technologies 
to improve energy efﬁ ciency. For example, 
the Chemical business explores novel 
materials and catalysts to improve energy 
efﬁ ciency. By using a new compound in the 
synthesis of butyl rubber ( 2 ), which takes 
place at very cold temperatures, Chemical 
Technology scientists raised the tempera-
ture at which the manufacturing process 
occurs—leading to considerable energy 
efﬁ ciency improvements.

Deﬁ ning our approach: 
discovery, development, 
and deployment
ExxonMobil conducts cutting-edge R&D 
through in-house efforts, via partner-
ships with other industries, and by funding 
academic and other nongovernmental 
research projects. As a technology moves 
from concept to research and application, 
ExxonMobil applies a consistent manage-
ment approach.

In 2007, we started applying a white paper 
process to explore emerging technologies. 
These studies help to educate the company 
on emerging technologies, deﬁ ne our poten-
tial contribution to the science, and assess 
the future applicability of the technologies 
to our businesses. The Corporation has 
engaged experts from a variety of disciplines 
within functional research labs to write white 
papers on topics ranging from biofuels to 
nanotechnology. In the course of develop-
ing these papers, EMEST may determine 
a particular technology warrants future 
investment. Recently, the team’s ﬁ ndings 
on photovoltaics ( 3 ) informed the updated 
Outlook for Energy.

The standard process for technology 
investment requires assessing technical fea-
sibility through R&D. ExxonMobil’s research 
functions follow a stage-gate research

EMRQ is developing virtual reality tech-
nology using sophisticated computer and 
video-based components to train our 
plant, terminal, and marine operators. 
Using this immersive 3D training environ-
ment, individuals working in Qatar’s oil 
and gas industry will be able to simulate 
actual work scenarios ranging from routine 
operations to emergency response, 
using detailed models of their facilities. 
The training platform can be connected 
to other 3D display units so that multiple 
ﬁ eld operators can train together on the 
same simulation exercise. This element 
of realism makes training more effective, 
helping personnel perform jobs more safely.

management system to progress technolo-
gies from the early stages of innovation 
through the ﬁ nal stages of deployment. 
Researchers partner with the business 
lines to determine the business beneﬁ t 
of a technology, establish research and 
development goals and timelines, steward 
independent project reviews, and authorize 
project funding. 

Time horizons for these projects vary sig-
niﬁ cantly. For example, we began evaluating 
remote gas detection in 2007. Researchers 
at EMRQ determined its technical feasibil-
ity in 2010. In 2011, EMRQ partnered with 
Louisiana State University Fire School to 
conduct ﬁ eld testing. Based upon adjust-
ments made after ﬁ eld tests, we anticipate 
the technology to be ready for commercial 
application in 2012, with potential deploy-
ment in 2013.

Breakthrough technologies can take much 
longer to develop. More than 20 years ago, 
an ExxonMobil researcher hypothesized 
that freezing the carbon dioxide (CO2) that 
is sometimes produced from underground 
natural gas reservoirs could be a more efﬁ -
cient approach to separation. ExxonMobil 
Upstream Research Company is currently 
testing the Controlled Freeze Zone™ (CFZ™, 4 ) 
technology at our LaBarge, Wyoming, gas 
facility. There, a tower freezes and separates 
CO2 from natural gas into a high-pressure 
stream, ideal for use in sequestration or in 

enhanced oil recovery. CFZ™ technology 
will require further evaluation before full 
commercialization and deployment might 
be possible. 

Technical and commercial 
feasibility
While many of our technology investments 
lead to deployment, there are no guaranteed 
outcomes. Even a technology that faces 
barriers to deployment can provide valuable 
insights to business decisions. After years 
of research and practice, we have learned 
that carbon capture and storage (CCS) is 
technically feasible, especially when applied 
to enhanced oil and natural gas production. 
CCS involves capturing, transporting, and 
storing CO2 in underground geologic forma-
tions such as saline or depleted oil and gas 
reservoirs. We have successfully captured 
and sold up to 7 million metric tons of CO2 
per year extracted from natural gas streams 
in Wyoming for enhanced oil recovery since 
1986. Through widespread application on 
ﬁ xed sources, such as power plants, the 
technologies involved in CCS could be 
an integral part of achieving global goals 
regarding climate change over the next 
century. However, the high cost associated 
with capturing CO2 from ﬂ ue gas currently 
makes CCS uneconomical for power plants 
where the largest CO2 reduction potential 
exists. ExxonMobil’s Corporate Strategic 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Collaborating with research institutions

The Global Energy Technology Strategy Program (GTSP) is a major project of the Joint 
Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI), a collaboration between the Paciﬁ c Northwest 
National Laboratory and the University of Maryland. JGCRI is home to one of the world’s 
leading integrated human and biogeophysical earth system modeling programs. Through 
the use of the JGCRI model, GTSP aims to enhance global decision-making by sharing 
open-source knowledge with public and private institutions. 

ExxonMobil is an active sponsor of GTSP, working collaboratively to assess opportuni-
ties for technology in climate change mitigation. Haroon Kheshgi, a senior researcher at 
ExxonMobil, interacts with GTSP regularly. “At ExxonMobil, we develop an Energy Outlook 
that goes out 30 years. GTSP looks out over the next century. Looking out 100 years 
is, of course, subject to considerable uncertainty. Interacting with GTSP, we can better 
understand, challenge, and improve our assumptions involved in projections over both 
the next decades and the next century.”

Jae Edmonds, chief scientist for the JCGRI and co-director of the GTSP, described the 
partnership’s dialogues: “ExxonMobil invited GTSP researchers down to Dallas, Texas, 
several times to meet with energy outlook analysts and exchange information on technol-
ogy in all parts of the energy system, ranging from power generation to transportation. 
We’ve had some very illuminating researcher interactions with ExxonMobil.” 

Research team is investigating materials 
and systems that could bring the cost down. 
We believe applying our experience in CCS 
for enhanced oil and natural gas production 
could lead to competitive, market-based 
solutions that include natural gas-ﬁ red 
power plants. Even so, we do not anticipate 
CCS becoming broadly applicable over the 
next few decades.

LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS

Identifying whether a technology can 
result in an environmental improvement 
over an existing process can be chal-
lenging, especially in the energy sector. 
ExxonMobil has established a cross-
functional team to share best practices 
in life cycle assessments (LCAs) for our 
products and technologies. The objective 
of these in-house efforts is to develop 
consistent comparisons of energy alter-
natives, as well as to build and extend the 
science of LCAs by working with leading 
academics and universities. 

In 2011, we conducted an LCA to assess 
the impact of algae biofuel production on 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land 
use, and water use. The study, com-
pleted in partnership with Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and Synthetic 
Genomics Inc., showed that with further 
research and development, algae biofu-
els could be produced with freshwater 
consumption equivalent to petroleum 
reﬁ ning, and enable lower GHG emis-
sions. This study has been accepted for 
publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Global climate change remains an extraordinarily complex issue. Scientiﬁ c evidence points to the fact 
that rising GHG emissions present risks to society and ecosystems—and that these risks warrant action 
by governments, companies, and citizens. Reducing GHG emissions while expanding energy supply is 
one of the greatest challenges facing our industry and modern society.

At ExxonMobil, our climate change risk 
management strategy includes four primary 
elements: mitigating GHG emissions in our 
operations, encouraging the responsible use 
of our products, developing cutting-edge 
technology, and engaging in dialogue to 
promote effective public policy. 

Mitigating GHG emissions in 
our operations
Technological innovation underpins 
ExxonMobil’s approach to reducing GHG 
emissions. In particular, we focus on increas-
ing energy efﬁ ciency in the short term; 
implementing emission-reducing technologies 
in the near and medium term; and develop-
ing breakthrough technologies for the long 
term (page 20). We are committed to ﬂ are 
reduction, energy efﬁ ciency, cogeneration of 
power and steam, and production efﬁ ciency 
improvements to reduce GHG emissions. 

In 2011, we invested $440 million to improve 
energy efﬁ ciency, reduce ﬂ aring, and reduce 
GHG emissions.

Greenhouse gas emissions in our operations. 
In 2011, ExxonMobil's net equity GHG 
emissions1 were 129 million metric tons, 
excluding emissions from the production 
of electricity and steam exported from our 
operations to other users. Our indirect GHG 
emissions from purchased electricity and 
steam were an estimated 14 million metric 
tons. Relative to our 2010 performance, this 
represents an increase of about 4 million 
metric tons, or 3 percent. 

Flaring. During crude oil extraction, a blend 
of hydrocarbon gases often accompanies 
oil to the surface. In certain situations, we 
ﬂ are this gas either as a safety measure or 
as a means of disposal when there are no 
economic means of capturing and using it. 
To avoid ﬂ aring, we need business environ-
ments with the right conditions, including 
available markets, nearby infrastructure, and 
appropriate regulations. Unfortunately, many 
of our remote upstream operations do not yet 
meet these criteria. 

In 2011, our upstream ﬂ aring averaged 
405 million cubic feet per day, an increase 
of 16 percent from 2010 and a reduction of 

53 percent from 2007. Relative to our net 
direct GHG emissions, ﬂ aring contributed 
approximately 9 percent. Our operations in 
Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea account for 
most of the ﬂ ared gas, contributing about 
68 percent of our total upstream ﬂ aring. We 
continue to make infrastructure investments to 
improve gas management in these countries. 

Energy efﬁ ciency. In 2011, energy used in 
our operations totaled 1.55 billion gigajoules. 
ExxonMobil pursues a variety of projects to 
improve energy efﬁ ciency. Since 2000, we 
have used our Global Energy Management 
System (GEMS) in the Downstream and 
Chemical business lines to methodically 
and rigorously identify and act on energy 
savings opportunities. The GEMS equivalent 
in the Upstream business is the Production 
Operations Energy Management System 
(POEMS). Implementation of GEMS and 
POEMS is helping us meet our 10 percent 
energy efﬁ ciency improvement target and 
reduce upstream ﬂ aring. 

Through 2011, we improved energy efﬁ ciency 
by approximately 9 percent in reﬁ ning and 
more than 12 percent in chemical manufac-
turing since 2002. Combined chemical and 
reﬁ ning operations have improved energy 
efﬁ ciency two to three times faster than the 
industry average. For an example of facility-
level energy efﬁ ciency improvements, please 
see our Singapore site tour (page 48). 

ExxonMobil recently announced plans to build 
a new campus on a 155-hectare site just north 
of Houston, Texas. We carefully considered 
energy conservation during the design phase 
of the campus and aim to achieve LEED Gold 
building certiﬁ cation. By optimizing daylight 
availability and incorporating other energy 
efﬁ ciency measures, we expect to reduce our 
energy demand in the ofﬁ ce buildings by more 
than 40 percent compared to traditional ofﬁ ce 
buildings, and 30 percent compared to the Bell 
Street ExxonMobil building in Houston. 

ExxonMobil’s Global Real Estate and 
Facilities group has been working on an initia-
tive to reduce the environmental footprint of 
our ofﬁ ces. This includes analysis of energy, 
water, and waste across our facilities. We 
are developing toolkits to help ExxonMobil 
facilities understand and implement energy 
management programs. We are also 

1Our calculations are based on the guidance provided in the Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry (American Petroleum Institute) and the 
Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions (International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association).

encouraging our facilities to record baseline 
energy performance data and metrics to drive 
performance and measure success. During 
2009–2010, a contractor conducted energy 
assessments at 21 of our international facili-
ties. They performed visual inspections and 
reviewed operating procedures and utility 
bills for electricity, natural gas, and water. 
Sites received a list of potential improvement 
opportunities and determined which projects 
to pursue.

Cogeneration. ExxonMobil is developing 
innovative ways to generate power more 
efﬁ ciently and with less environmental impact 
compared to purchasing electricity from 
a local utility. Cogeneration captures heat 
generated from the production of electricity 
to use in production, reﬁ ning, and chemical 
processing operations. With interests in more 
than 5000 megawatts of cogeneration capac-
ity globally, in 2011 we added 120 megawatts 
of additional capacity from our new cogen-
eration facility in the Netherlands. Another 
new cogeneration facility in Singapore will 
come online in 2012, adding approximately 
220 megawatts.

Developing cutting-edge 
technology
Our ability to develop breakthrough technol-
ogy is paramount to our long-term business 
success. ExxonMobil currently has research 
underway to more efﬁ ciently and effectively 
increase energy supplies, reduce emissions, 
and improve operational efﬁ ciency. For more 
information about our partnerships and in-
house technology capabilities, please also 
see our technology case study (page 20).

Supporting long-term scientiﬁ c research. 
ExxonMobil supports long-term collaborative 
scientiﬁ c research related to GHG emis-
sions. Since 2002, we have contributed more 
than half of our $100 million commitment to 
Stanford’s Global Climate and Energy Project, 
which is focused on identifying breakthrough 
energy technologies. Many of the technologies 
are years away from widespread adoption, but 
still hold promise.

In 2009, ExxonMobil announced our algae 
biofuels research and development program. 
Since then, we have made progress toward 
identifying and developing strains of algae 
with desired characteristics. Algae-based 
biofuels could enhance the world’s transpor-
tation fuel supply while consuming carbon 
dioxide (CO2). We understand developing 
such alternative technologies poses many 
challenges, and overcoming them will require 
a considerable investment of time, money, 
and scientiﬁc expertise. 

We are progressing a number of technolo-
gies to enable the commercial development 
of in situ bitumen in our heavy oil ﬁ elds in 
Canada, where this resource lies too deep for 
surface mining. Current efforts are focused 
on the use of solvents to access undeveloped 
resources and reduce GHGs, among other 
environmental and economic beneﬁ ts. 

ExxonMobil’s proprietary Controlled Freeze 
ZoneTM (CFZTM) technology freezes and 
separates CO2 from natural gas into a 
high-pressure stream, ideal for use in seques-
tration or in enhanced oil recovery. CFZTM 
technology could make carbon capture and 
storage more affordable and efﬁ cient in 
reducing GHG emissions. This technology 
continues to be developed for commercial 
demonstration and subsequent application. 

Encouraging responsible 
product use
According to the International Energy Agency, 
approximately 90 percent of the GHG emis-
sions generated by petroleum products are 
released when consumers use these products, 
and the remaining 10 percent are generated 
by the operations to produce them. Electricity 
generation is the largest and fastest-growing 
source of global energy demand. Moreover, 
much of the energy created to produce elec-
tricity is lost to inefﬁ ciency. For example, 
a new electricity-generating turbine powered 
by coal or nuclear material is, at most, about 
40 percent efﬁ cient. That means that for every 
100 units of primary energy input, only 
40 units or less are converted to usable 
electrical energy. New natural gas plants have 
a 60-percent efﬁ ciency rate. Improving fuel use 
efﬁ ciency represents one of the biggest oppor-
tunities for curbing growth in energy demand 
and CO2 emissions in the coming decades. 

Improving product efﬁ ciency. ExxonMobil 
works directly with industrial customers to 
design products aimed at improving energy 
efﬁ ciency. Our advanced lubricating oils and 
greases can help increase fuel economy, 
contribute to longer lubricant life, and extend 
equipment life. To help achieve global vehicle 
ﬂ eet transportation efﬁ ciency improvements, 
ExxonMobil is contributing to near- and long-
term advances in vehicle, fuel, and lubricant 
technology. Some of our recent advances in 
product energy efﬁ ciency include:

•  Mobil SHC Pegasus synthetic natural gas 
engine oil enhances performance in natural gas 
engines used for cogeneration and is one of 
the ﬁ rst gas engine oils to offer fuel economy 
beneﬁ ts; and,

•  Mobil SHC 600, which we recently refor-
mulated, is up to 3.6 percent more energy 
efﬁ cient compared to conventional mineral 
oils in gear applications.

Public policy debate
Managing the risks associated with climate 
change requires the participation of govern-
ment, consumers, and the private sector to 
develop and sustain effective technologies and 
policies that reduce the global carbon footprint.

ExxonMobil supports adopting strategies for 
reducing emissions that are stable, predict-
able, long-term, simple, and transparent—and 
that encourage the greatest reduction in 
emissions at the least possible cost to society. 
When considering policy options, ExxonMobil 
advocates an approach that:

•  Ensures a uniform and predictable cost 
of carbon;

•  Lets market prices drive solutions;

•  Maximizes transparency to stakeholders;

•  Reduces administrative complexity;

•  Promotes global participation; and,

•  Is easily adjusted to future developments in 
climate science and policy impacts.

If governments consider the adoption of regu-
latory frameworks, we believe a well-designed, 
revenue-neutral carbon tax mechanism pro-
vides a cost-effective policy approach. When 
combined with further advances in energy 
efﬁ ciency and new technologies spurred by 
market innovation, a carbon tax could play a 
signiﬁ cant role in reducing GHG emissions. 
Mitigating global CO2 emissions will require 
participation from developed countries and 
the major developing economies in any policy 
response. We will continue to actively and 
constructively participate in global policy 
discussions. 

Global engagement on climate change. In 
2011, we discussed policy issues with govern-
ments and legislators around the world, 
including Australia, Canada, European Union 
countries, Japan, Singapore, and the United 
States. ExxonMobil was represented at the 
United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change meeting in Durban, South 
Africa, as an observer, and our staff contin-
ues to participate in the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change.

ExxonMobil has research underway to more efﬁ ciently increase energy supplies, reduce emissions, and improve 
operational efﬁ ciency. Above, an employee works at the CFZ™ technology demonstration plant in Wyoming. 
For more information about this breakthrough technology, please see page 20.

We test a range of potential cost scenarios 
for energy-related GHG emissions in our 
Outlook for Energy (see page 4). These 
forecasts use a cost on CO2 emissions to 
represent future climate policy options.

(OECD) CO2 costs reaching about $80 per 
ton by 2040. At that time, we project China 
will impose costs of $30 per ton, with many 
Non-OECD nations approaching $20 per ton.

We engage regularly with governmental 
advisory panels and related scientiﬁ c bodies 
around climate change issues. For example, 
in 2011, we contributed to the United States 
National Petroleum Council report on energy 
resources and to the IHS CERA publication on 
Sound Energy Policy for Europe, and we sub-
mitted testimony to parliamentary committees 
in the United Kingdom and Australia. During 
2011, ExxonMobil representatives continued to 
speak on climate-related issues at events such 
as Net Impact, the International Petrochemical 
Conference, the World Petroleum Congress, 
and the World Shale Gas Conference. 

Funding of advocacy groups and research. 
ExxonMobil supports many public policy and 
academic organizations that research and 

promote discussion on issues affecting our 
business, including climate change. We elect 
to fund organizations whose research contrib-
utes constructively to the dialogue on effective 
policy and technology. We have ceased funding 
groups we believe were addressing the public 
policy discussion by questioning the science of 
climate change as opposed to exploring solu-
tions to this complicated challenge.

We publish our support of 501(c)(3) organi-
zations on our website. In 2011, our climate-
related advocacy and research funding 
beneﬁ ciaries included the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, Stanford University, 
the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and 
Research Economics and Sciences, Battelle 
Paciﬁ c Northwest Laboratory, the Lamont 
Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia 
University, the Brookings Institution, the 
American Enterprise Institute, the Council 
on Foreign Relations, Chatham House, 
Resources for the Future, and the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies.

METHANE CAPTURE FROM MUNICIPAL LANDFILLS

In the ﬁ rst ExxonMobil project of its kind, 
we are tapping an East Baton Rouge Parish 
municipal landﬁ ll as an energy source for our 
Louisiana polyoleﬁ ns plant. The manufacture 
of polyethylene and polypropylene at the 
Baton Rouge facility requires steam histori-
cally generated by three natural gas boilers. 
The landﬁ ll’s 6 million tons of decomposing 
waste releases a gas composed of about 
50 percent methane and 50 percent CO2. 

After two years of research and development 
and $1.8 million in facility upgrades, the 
methane capture project eliminates the 
ﬂ aring of landﬁ ll gas. We now treat and 
transport that gas nearly 6.5 kilometers to 
our plant to help fuel the boilers. Using this 
previously ﬂ ared landﬁ ll gas as an energy 
source is equivalent to removing 59,000 cars 
from the road.

This project was cost-effective and envi-
ronmentally beneﬁ cial for the plant and 
also generated a new revenue source for 
the city of Baton Rouge and East Baton 
Rouge Parish. The site was recognized with 
awards from both the American Chemical 
Council and the Louisiana Department 
of Environmental Quality for this effort. 
ExxonMobil expects to purchase more 
landﬁ ll gas as system capacity is added.

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     27

Safety, security, and health 
management
Excellence in safety, security, and health in the 
workplace is a core value for our company. 
We manage the risks associated with our 
operations through the implementation of our 
Operations Integrity Management System 
(OIMS). Every ExxonMobil employee and 
contractor accepts safety as a job requirement, 
whether working at a desk or on an oil platform.

Personnel safety 
While our safety performance remains strong in 
the industry, in 2011, our combined employee 
and contractor workforce lost-time incident per-
formance declined. This outcome reinforces our 
steadfast commitment to thoroughly investigate 
the underlying causes of incidents and focus 
relentlessly on effective risk management.

In 2011, XTO safety data were combined with 
data for the rest of ExxonMobil’s operations, 
which introduced a basis change. XTO is in 
the process of implementing OIMS and is 
committed to achieving solid safety perfor-
mance. It took ExxonMobil many years to 
develop its safety culture and to embed OIMS 
throughout its operations. We are conﬁ dent 
that XTO will continuously improve perfor-
mance as implementation proceeds. 

The safety performance of legacy ExxonMobil 
assets (excluding those of XTO), through 
year-end 2011, did not meet our expectations. 
As a result, we have increased emphasis on 
the prevention of serious incidents, which can 
lead to lost-time injuries and fatalities. We 
continue to set high expectations for safety 
performance across our operations for all 
workers—contractors and employees. As 
always, our goal is to provide and maintain 
a workplace where Nobody Gets Hurt. We 
know this is achievable, and will continue to 
work toward that standard. 

It is with deep regret that we report that 
nine workers were fatally injured in 2011 in 
connection with ExxonMobil operations. 
We thoroughly investigated each incident, 
determined root causes, and identiﬁ ed steps 
to prevent similar events in the future. 

During 2011, we began to apply learnings 
from cross-industry research efforts to study 
improved approaches for the prevention of 
serious injuries and fatalities. Through these 
studies, ExxonMobil gained new insights into 
more effective prevention strategies that focus 
on identifying underlying causes and expanding 
data analysis associated with incidents and near-
misses that have potential serious outcomes. 

Personnel safety study. As a result of the 
personnel safety study concluded in 2010, 
we are enhancing our leadership training 
through the development and piloting of new 
OIMS Leadership Academies. 

During 2011, we oriented global safety aware-
ness efforts around “Actively Caring and 
Approaching Others”—an integral charac-
teristic of an established and effective safety 
culture where all workers take ownership and 
accountability for their own and each other’s 
personal safety. Workers are empowered and 
encouraged to ask questions or to comment 
when another worker—whether peer or super-
visor—appears to be at risk. Workers also learn 
how to constructively receive input from others, 
knowing it is intended to keep them from harm. 

Contractor safety. From building pipelines to 
working on offshore platforms, thousands of 
contractors support our operations every day. 
At many of the projects that ExxonMobil 
manages, the majority of workers at the project 
site are contractors. When prequalifying 
contractors, we evaluate safety performance 
as a key criterion (see case study, page 36). 
In 2011, ExxonMobil Development Company 
conducted a series of global contractor safety 
forums for approximately 4800 attendees in 
33 countries. The main theme of this effort was 
Safety Excellence through Visible Leadership 
and each forum featured a series of presenta-
tions intended to help contractors consider 
new ways to lead with safety practices. 
Planning is underway for another series of 
contractor safety forums in 2012. 

Process safety. Process safety is a frame-
work for managing the integrity of operating 
systems by applying good design principles, 
engineering, and operating and maintenance 
practices. Effective process safety manage-
ment prevents the uncontrolled release of 
hydrocarbons and other hazardous sub-
stances to avoid signiﬁ cant incidents with 
potential for serious injuries and fatalities, 
widespread environmental impacts, and 
property damage. Our approach focuses 
on reducing risks and incidents through the 
ﬂ awless execution of OIMS. We subscribe to 
industry standards—the American Petroleum 
Institute’s Recommended Practice 754 
and International Association of Oil & Gas 
Producers No. 456—which deﬁ ne process 
safety events and use a process safety 
incident triangle to represent events from 
Tier 1 through Tier 4. 

During 2011, we had 71 Tier 1 process safety 
events. Incident analysis indicates that human 
factors and procedures were the contributing 

The “Actively Caring and Approaching Others” 
focus stems from ExxonMobil’s desire to eliminate 
all incidents and ensure Nobody Gets Hurt.

Process safety events fall into two categories: 
Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 3 represents process

element for nearly half of these events. Our 
emphasis on process safety management 
across the company remains constant, as 
we investigate, analyze, and learn from these 
and lower severity Tier 2, 3, and 4 events and 
indicators. We focus on best practices in design, 
mechanical integrity, and upgrades using 
advanced technologies, and we train employees 
in process safety and effective procedures. 

System (PSIMS) applies common global 
processes and a global computer system to 
capture and communicate information on the 
safe handling, transport, use, and disposal 
of our products. ExxonMobil Biomedical 
Sciences, Inc. (EMBSI) coordinates with each 
of our business lines to monitor, advise, and 
evaluate a growing number of new regulatory 
requirements on our products. 

Product stewardship and 
product safety
ExxonMobil works to minimize risks and 
impacts associated with the manufacture, 
use, and disposal of our products. We con-
sider product stewardship issues in all stages, 
including inception, design and development, 
manufacture and storage, transport and distri-
bution, marketing, use, and disposal.

As part of product stewardship, we assess 
safety, health, and environmental aspects 
as well as compliance with product safety 
legislation, both where our products are 
made and in their intended markets. OIMS 
and other management systems help ensure 
compliance with product stewardship regula-
tions in more than 150 countries. Our Product 
Stewardship Information Management 

EMBSI assesses human and environmental 
hazards along with risks of our products and 
their components, and develops hazard com-
munication documents. In addition, ExxonMobil 
toxicologists, industrial hygienists, epidemiolo-
gists, physicians, and environmental scientists 
work to continually improve our understanding 
of occupational and environmental health. 

Customer communication is a large part of 
product stewardship. During development 
and deployment, we identify hazard and risk 
management practices—including appropri-
ate uses, potential health and environmental 
effects, personal protection and exposure 
controls, ﬁ rst aid measures, and disposal 
considerations—and communicate this 
information to customers via Safety Data 
Sheets, product data sheets, labels, and 
technical guidance. We tailor our product 
safety warnings to comply with local 

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE

Effective emergency preparedness is depen-
dent on competent response teams. To 
develop and practice emergency response 
strategies, we establish Emergency Support 
Groups comprising representatives from 
business lines; human resources; law; 
safety, security, health, and environment; 
public affairs; and other technical advi-
sors. To respond quickly and effectively to 
operational incidents, we routinely test these 
trained teams on a range of possible sce-
narios, including simulated product spills, 
ﬁ res, explosions, natural disasters, and 
security incidents. 

Every site conducts emergency drills in 
accordance with regulatory requirements 
and OIMS guidelines. These drills range 
from routine ﬁ re drills to full-scale exercises. 
We operate in some parts of the world 
without clear emergency response require-
ments. In these cases, we apply global best 
practices to determine the frequency of 
emergency drills. Each year, we conduct at 
least one comprehensive drill in each of our 
operating regions. 

Inside a comprehensive response drill.
We conducted a comprehensive drill at 
our Sakhalin, Russia, facility in September 
2011. The drill included 230 employees, 

contractors, and specialists from at least four 
countries, and lasted two days. During emer-
gency drills, participants run through realistic 
scenarios including real-time decisions and 
interaction with local authorities. The Sakhalin 
drill involved deploying several marine vessels 
for a simulated spill cleanup, modeling the 
trajectory of the spill, and conducting simu-
lated dispersant application with helicopters. 
For the purpose of simulation, workers trav-
eled to the location of the drill as they would 
in an actual situation. Several representatives 
from various Russian regulatory authori-
ties participated. The exercise conﬁ rmed 
our readiness to respond and helped us 
identify improvements to the Sakhalin Oil Spill 
Response Plan. 

Response in action—Yellowstone River 
in Montana. On July 1, 2011, ExxonMobil 
Pipeline Company (EMPCo) experienced a 
breach in its Silvertip Pipeline resulting in the 
release of an estimated 1509 barrels of crude 
oil into Yellowstone River near Laurel, Montana. 

EMPCo immediately began implementing its 
emergency response plans, drawing upon 
local resources at the ExxonMobil Billings 
Reﬁ nery as well as experts from across the 
country. A Uniﬁ ed Command Center, led by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 

(EPA) and including representatives from 
the State of Montana, was established. 
More than 1000 people were involved in 
the response and cleanup effort includ-
ing ExxonMobil’s North America Regional 
Response Team, the Clean Harbors and 
Emergency Responder oil spill response 
organizations, and additional contractors.

EMPCo worked closely with the EPA and 
the Montana Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) to ensure cleanup goals 
and objectives were clearly deﬁ ned, and 
subsequently completed as outlined by 
the Uniﬁ ed Command. Work now contin-
ues under the direction of the MDEQ and 
has now transitioned into reclamation and 
remediation activity. This includes a com-
prehensive soil and water monitoring and 
sampling program. 

At the Laurel Crossing, EMPCo installed 
new pipeline approximately 60 feet below 
the river bottom. In addition, new pipeline 
was installed 30 feet or more below the river 
bottom near the shore at the Rock Creek 
and Clarks Fork crossings.

EMPCo takes full responsibility for the 
incident and cleanup, and continues to work 
cooperatively with all agencies involved in 
investigating the spill.

SUPPORTING POLIO ERADICATION
IN ANGOLA

The World Health Organization has made 
great strides toward eradicating polio; 
only a handful of countries still report 
active cases. In Angola, one of the biggest 
barriers to achieving eradication is access 
to remote areas. The Angolan Ministry of 
Health received a $600,000 grant from 
the Block 15 consortium operated by 
Esso Angola to purchase four-wheel-
drive vehicles, motorcycles, and vaccine 
storage equipment for health ofﬁ cials and 
trained community health volunteers to 
vaccinate Angolans in isolated parts of the 
country. Angola reported only ﬁ ve cases 
of polio in 2011.

To complement our polio vaccine support, 
we also provided a $1 million grant to the 
Ministry of Health’s vaccination program 
in four provinces. Implemented in partner-
ship with the Angolan Red Cross, more 
than 200,000 children under ﬁ ve years 
of age are being vaccinated against nine 
life-threatening childhood diseases: polio, 
diphtheria, tetanus, measles, whooping 
cough, yellow fever, hepatitis, meningitis, 
and pneumonia.

regulations; where product safety regula-
tions do not exist, we apply responsible 
standards. In 2011, we distributed more than 
300,000 Safety Data Sheets to customers in 
more than 130 languages. 

Life cycle assessments. ExxonMobil 
Chemical Company follows the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO 
14040:2006 and 14044:2006) in develop-
ing life cycle assessments (LCAs). Two LCA 
examples include the assessment of our 
High Barrier Metallyte™ oriented polypropyl-
ene ﬁ lms (OPP) relative to aluminum foil, a 
product used for similar applications. It dis-
played lower energy consumption, reduced 
waste, and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. Another example involves our 
metallocene polyethylene (mPE) resins used 
in packaging construction products, such as 
mortar and cement mix, relative to paper. The 
analysis showed that mPE resins have several 
environmental advantages, including require-
ments for fewer raw material inputs. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Customer life cycle 
assessment

One of our customers specializing in 
industrial packaging, NORDFOLIEN GmbH, 
approached ExxonMobil for help on an LCA 
to understand the environmental impact 
of polyethylene versus paper packaging. 
We developed a charter for the collabora-
tion and agreed that ExxonMobil Chemical 
would conduct the analysis. An indepen-
dent third-party external panel reviewed the 
LCA for completeness and transparency. 
The results showed that polyethylene sacks 
had signiﬁ cant environmental beneﬁ ts over 
paper alternatives, as they are lighter, have 
lower energy and GHG proﬁ les, and are 
more durable, minimizing product loss. We 
plan to continue engaging with our custom-
ers on other LCAs.

Workplace security 
Protecting worker and community safety 
also means ensuring security and protec-
tion of information. Our security programs 
are designed to meet the challenges of 
the diverse locations where we operate. 
At ExxonMobil, Security is Everybody’s 
Business. In 2011, we focused on enhanced 
security countermeasures for people, assets, 
and information in higher-threat locations 
where ExxonMobil operates. We also con-
tinued implementation of risk assessment 
processes to identify and implement asset-
speciﬁ c security enhancements. For more 
information about security at ExxonMobil, 
see page 45. 

Employee health
ExxonMobil provides support programs 
and services to help our employees live 
healthier lives. We consider workforce 
and community health issues as part 
of our project planning, using tools like 
Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Health 
Impact Assessments (ESHIAs) (see page 18). 
We develop prevention programs and health 
care services to respond to emerging health 
issues in a timely manner. During 2011, we 
established a new infectious disease com-
mittee to monitor and address emerging 
disease-related issues.

Culture of Health. ExxonMobil’s Culture of 
Health is our U.S. site-based health and well-
ness program. It provides a broad, systematic 
approach to health promotion activities 
in the workplace, including resources for 
ExxonMobil employees and family members 
to achieve personal health goals. After testing 
this program at two work sites, we expanded 
the program to all U.S. sites in 2011. Culture 
of Health offers a state-of-the-art health 
portal with a wellness library, meal plan-
ners, and wellness and ﬁ tness trackers. The 
program also includes on-site biometric 
screenings, annual health assessments to 
detect potential health risks, and telephone-
based lifestyle coaching. More than 13,000 
individuals participated in this program in 
2011. Worksite-based program components 
are being added throughout 2012.

Malaria Control Program. Malaria costs the 
African continent an average of $12 billion 
in lost gross domestic product annually and 
impacts household incomes through lost 
productivity and healthcare expenditures. 
The locations where we operate in Africa 
and parts of Asia Paciﬁ c are no excep-
tion. ExxonMobil’s comprehensive Malaria 
Control Program covers both employees and 
contractors working in malaria-prone areas. 
It includes awareness campaigns, mosquito 
bite prevention tools, and anti-malaria medi-
cation, and promotes early diagnosis and 
treatment to ﬁ ght malaria. 

We track employee and contractor incidences 
of malaria in eight countries with upstream 
operations. In 2011, 11 malaria cases were 
reported out of the thousands of nonimmune 
workers located in or visiting endemic areas. 
To learn about our efforts to eradicate global 
malaria in the communities where we operate, 
see page 42.

StopAIDS. Our workplace HIV/AIDS program, 
StopAIDS, combines educational programs 
with access to community-based care and 
treatment to keep healthy workers disease-
free, and to educate HIV-positive workers on

LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK

Our business activities require leaders who 
can effectively work in a complex global 
environment. A deliberate and focused effort 
across our company ensures we identify and 
mentor individuals, design challenging work 
assignments, support on-the-job experi-
ences, and provide training and education. 
The ExxonMobil Leadership Framework 
includes three major components: fun-
damental business principles, essential 
personal qualities, and behaviors to achieve 
premier business results. We embedded this 
Framework within our business practices 
and our people development processes. 

Employment policies and 
practices 
ExxonMobil focuses on developing a diverse 
workforce of highly talented individuals to help 
our business thrive. We use a long-term, career-
oriented approach that begins with global 
recruitment of outstanding talent and continues 
with development from within through a wide 
range of assignments and experiences.

Diversity. ExxonMobil conducts business in 
almost every part of the world. The diversity 
of ideas, perspectives, skills, knowledge, and 
cultures across our company facilitates inno-
vation and is a key competitive advantage. 
Through a range of programs, activities, and 
investments, we strive to create and maintain 
a diverse workforce, representative of the 
many geographies where we do business. 
We developed our Global Workforce Diversity 
Framework to attract, grow, and retain a 
premier workforce. A series of web-based 
trainings and tools help our employees under-
stand effective cross-cultural communication 
and cultural sensitivities.

We support local employee networks around 
the world to foster a work environment com-
mitted to diversity and inclusion. These include 
the Asian Connection for Excellence (ACE); 
Black Employee Success Team (BEST); Global 
Organization for the Advancement of Latinos 
(GOAL); People for Respect, Inclusion, and 
Diversity of Employees (PRIDE); and Women’s 
Interest Network (WIN). These groups often 
sponsor educational and community service 
programs for interested employees.

Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, 
and the National Action Council for Minorities 
in Engineering, among others. We believe these 
strategic investments in education will help 
build a global pool of talent in science, technol-
ogy, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) 
ﬁ elds to support the further development of the 
oil and gas industry. Without education today, 
we cannot advance technological innovation to 
help meet our future energy needs.

At the end of 2011, about 39 percent of our 
employees were located within the United 
States and 61 percent internationally. In 2011, 
approximately 34 percent of our executives 
were non-U.S. employees. We hired more than 
2100 management and professional employ-
ees worldwide, about 79 percent of whom 
were outside the United States.

ExxonMobil is committed to promoting 
leadership opportunities for women glob-
ally and improving the gender balance within 
our company. Currently, women account for 
about 26 percent of our worldwide workforce, 
excluding company-operated retail stores. In 
2011, 44 percent of management and profes-
sional new hires were women, signiﬁ cantly 
higher than the percentage of women in our 
broader employee population. Approximately 
14 percent of executive employees worldwide 
are women. Our commitment to gender equal-
ity extends to all aspects of the employment 
relationship, including recruitment, hiring, pro-
motion, transfer, termination, wage and salary 
administration, and selection for training.

To increase the representation of minorities 
in our U.S. operations, our hiring programs 
include outreach to identify diverse candi-
dates. Based on U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission reporting, minori-
ties made up approximately 28 percent of 
our U.S. workforce and about 18 percent of 
ofﬁ cials and managers in 2011. 

Policies against discrimination and harass-
ment. Our Standards of Business Conduct 
govern our employment practices. These 
standards support our commitment to equal 
employment opportunities, prohibit harass-
ment and discrimination in the workplace, 
and align with applicable laws and regulations 
in the countries where we operate. Any form 
of discrimination by or toward employees, 
contractors, suppliers, and customers in any 
ExxonMobil workplace is strictly prohibited. 
Our global, zero-tolerance policy applies to 
all forms of discrimination, including dis-
crimination based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity. Harassment, even in its most 
subtle forms, directly conﬂ icts with company 
policy and will not be tolerated. All employees 
are subject to disciplinary action, includ-
ing termination, for any act of harassment. 
We employ a comprehensive education, 
training, and stewardship program to ensure 
this policy is understood, implemented, and 
followed by our employees throughout our 
worldwide operations. Each afﬁ liate has 
adopted ExxonMobil’s global standards with 
modiﬁ cations only as needed to comply with 
country laws.

Employee beneﬁ ts and programs. Exxon 
Mobil Corporation is committed to being the 
world’s premier petroleum and petrochemical 
company. Our beneﬁ ts programs are part of a 
total employment package and are designed 
to support our business objectives and be 
responsive to the needs of employees through-
out a career into retirement. They also support 
ExxonMobil in attracting and retaining the most 
qualiﬁ ed employees.

Providing access to healthcare at an 
affordable cost helps employees reduce dis-
tractions associated with healthcare issues, 
quality of care, and related ﬁ nancial concerns, 
enabling the employee to remain productive 
and focused on job responsibilities. Strong 
healthcare plans and health-related programs 
also reinforce the Corporation’s commitment 
to safety and wellness.

Beneﬁ t coverage for spouses is based on 
legally recognized spousal relationships in the 
individual countries where we operate. In the 
United States, we have adopted the deﬁ ni-
tion of spouse used in federal law. Employees 
in countries where national law recognizes 
same-sex relationships receive spousal ben-
eﬁ ts under ExxonMobil programs.

ExxonMobil conducts business in almost every part of the world. The diversity of ideas, perspectives, skills, 
knowledge, and cultures across our company facilitates innovation and is a key competitive advantage.

The funding levels of qualiﬁ ed pension 
plans comply with applicable laws or regu-
lations. Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension obligations 
are fully supported by the ﬁ nancial strength 
of the Corporation or the respective spon-
soring afﬁ liate. 

Flexible work environment. Our workplace 
ﬂ exibility programs help us attract and retain 
talent, address individual employee needs, 
and maximize employee productivity. Each 
country’s workplace ﬂ exibility programs differ 
based on legal requirements, infrastructure, 
and culture. Examples of employee programs 
providing ﬂ exibility include an adaptable 
workplace, modiﬁ ed work weeks, part-time 
regular employment, extended part-time 
employment, and adjustable work hours.

Performance review process. During 
the annual performance assessment and 
development process, all employees have a 
structured, documented discussion with their 
supervisors about work goals, training objec-
tives, and development needs. This process 
provides the basis for ongoing employee 
coaching and continuous performance 
improvement. Employees are actively devel-
oped throughout the course of their careers 
with training, mentoring, and opportunities to 
join professional networks.

Employee engagement. ExxonMobil strives 
to communicate openly with our more than 
82,000 employees. In 2011, presidents of 
the functional companies held more than 
19 town-hall-style forums and numerous 
meetings with employees, addressing topics 
ranging from safety performance to long-
term planning. We hold these forums across 
our operations. Employees have the opportu-
nity to ask senior management questions on 
any topic during these sessions.

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     33

Sound corporate governance requires clear expectations of high ethical standards and integrity in 
all business activities and investment decisions. ExxonMobil’s ethics and high standards of business 
conduct allow us to operate in an economic climate where large-scale investments support our long-
term business and contribute to the communities where we operate. 

Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors provides independent 
oversight of the Corporation’s affairs. All direc-
tors stand for election at our Annual Meeting 
of Shareholders. At year-end 2011, 10 of 11 
directors and all members of key Board com-
mittees, including the presiding director, were 
independent as deﬁ ned by New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE) guidelines. In 2011, the Board 
of Directors met 10 times, including a visit to 
Alberta, Canada, to review afﬁ liated operations. 

Board leadership structure. At this time, 
the Board serves the best interests of the 
shareholders through a leadership model with 
a combined chairman of the Board and chief 
executive ofﬁ cer (CEO). With more than 36 
years of service in both domestic and interna-
tional positions, the current CEO possesses 
in-depth knowledge of the Corporation and 
the challenges of an evolving energy industry. 
The Board believes these insights position 
him to provide exemplary leadership. The 
Board retains the authority to amend the 
By-Laws to separate the chairman and CEO 
positions at any time. 

Each year, the independent Board members 
select an independent director to serve a 
minimum of two years as presiding direc-
tor. The presiding director chairs executive 
sessions of the independent directors and 
works closely with the chairman to develop 
Board agendas, topics, and schedules, and 
review materials provided to the directors. 
All directors may request agenda topics for 

Board or Board committee meetings, and all 
have authority to call special meetings of the 
independent directors.

Board appointment process. Achieving a 
Board of Directors that is diverse in gender, 
race, geography, experiences, and ﬁ elds of 
expertise is critical to successful business 
in a globalized market. The Board Affairs 
Committee nominates director candidates 
in accordance with the Guidelines for the 
Selection of Non-Employee Directors. The 
committee looks for highly qualiﬁ ed non-
employee candidates with demonstrated 
competency in a particular ﬁ eld, and a 
commitment to represent the interests of all 
shareholders. Other desirable qualities include:

•  Financial expertise;

•  Experience as the CEO or senior executive 
of a signiﬁ cant company or organization with 
responsibilities for global operations;

•  Experience on one or more boards of 
signiﬁ cant public or nongovernmental organi-
zations; and,

•  Expertise resulting from signiﬁ cant pro-
fessional or academically based scientiﬁ c 
or research activities.

In 2011, the Board included female, African-
American, and international perspectives. 
Current director qualiﬁ cations are described 
in the proxy statement.

Board committees. Corporate citizenship 
topics fall under the purview of the Public 
Issues and Contributions (PICC), Board 

Affairs, and Compensation Committees and 
are routinely reviewed at Board and Board 
committee meetings. Only independent direc-
tors serve on these committees, which met 
between four and seven times in 2011.

The entire Board is responsible for risk over-
sight. The committees help the Board carry 
out risk oversight by focusing on aspects 
relevant to their committee. Each committee’s 
charter is available on our website. 

Executive compensation and strategic 
advantage. At ExxonMobil, our compen-
sation program is carefully structured to 
support long-term shareholder value given 
the capital-intensive nature of our business, 
long investment lead times, and the criti-
cal importance of managing risk. The most 
senior executives—including the CEO, named 
executive ofﬁ cers, and more than 1000 other 
U.S. executives—participate in a common 
compensation program. 

Compensation decisions for executives take 
into account several key criteria, includ-
ing results in the areas of safety, security, 
health, and environmental performance. 
The Operations Integrity Management 
System (OIMS) Framework, which estab-
lishes common expectations for addressing 
inherent risks in our business, takes priority 
over other business and ﬁ nancial objectives. 
ExxonMobil executives understand that their 
compensation will reﬂ ect how effectively they 
implement this Framework. The design of the 
compensation program, including the long 

PUBLIC ISSUES AND CONTRIBUTIONS COMMITTEE

The PICC reviews and provides advisory 
guidance on publicly signiﬁ cant policies, 
programs, and practices, including corpo-
rate citizenship topics. According to PICC 
chairman, Mr. Edward Whitacre, Jr., “The 
PICC’s charter is to advise the Corporation 
on public issues, especially those relating 
to safety, health, and the environment, and 
on overall contributions objectives, policies, 
and programs. This role allows us to assess 
these activities, monitor performance and 
action plans to improve performance, and 
make site visits to ensure adherence to 
company policies and procedures.” 

Assessing safety, security, health, and 
environmental performance is a key part of 
the PICC’s activities. The vice president of 

safety, security, health, and environment 
provides the PICC with an annual overview 
presentation of our safety, security, health, 
and environmental performance. The PICC 
was particularly interested in learning about 
our safety program and water management 
initiatives during the 2011 presentation. 

In April, the vice president of public and 
government affairs met with the PICC 
to discuss stakeholder perspectives on 
natural gas and hydraulic fracturing and the 
Corporation’s outreach strategy. During the 
meeting, the PICC also discussed our cor-
porate blog exxonmobilperspectives.com 
as a means of two-way communication with 
the general public.

During 2011, the PICC also reviewed 
ExxonMobil’s 2011 Outlook for Energy, 
Contributions Budget Guidelines for 2012, 
and proposed 2012 Contributions Budget 
of the Corporation. 

The PICC members and other directors visit 
ExxonMobil operating sites and discuss 
insights. In 2010, the PICC visited the Port 
Allen Lubricants Plant and in 2011, the 
PICC members and other directors visited 
the Kearl project in Alberta, Canada. In 
2012, the PICC plans to visit operations in 
Wyoming and will talk with employees and 
review site-speciﬁ c safety and environ-
mental performance data.

Our Board of Directors provides independent oversight of the management of the Corporation.

Ethics
High standards of business conduct are a key 
competitive strength—critical to maintaining 
our global license to operate. Our presence 
in nearly every country of the world requires 
training on international trade laws, including 
the U.S. anti-corruption and antitrust laws, 
as well as those in other countries where we 
do business. All employees are expected 
to uphold the highest ethical standards of 
business integrity. They must comply with all 
applicable laws and accurately record and 
track all business transactions. Employees 
are subject to disciplinary action, includ-
ing termination, for violations of our policies. 
Employees receive training on our ethics policy 
every four years through Business Practices 
Reviews, including a detailed review of our 
Standards of Business Conduct; implementa-
tion guidelines and procedures; and a review 
of antitrust, competition, and anti-corruption 
laws. These general training sessions, in addi-
tion to more comprehensive training given to 
relevant functions on a more frequent basis, 
are a condition of employment at ExxonMobil. 

Standards of Business Conduct. Our 
Standards of Business Conduct deﬁ ne the 
global ethical conduct of the Corporation 
and its majority-owned subsidiaries. These 
Standards uphold the values of human rights, 
labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. 
The Board of Directors has adopted and 
oversees the administration of the Standards. 
No one has authority to make exceptions or 
grant waivers to the Standards. Disciplinary 
action is taken against any employee who 
violates these Standards. Employees are 
expected to review the Standards each year. 
While ExxonMobil is not a formal signatory of 
the United Nations Global Compact, its values 
represent key elements of our Standards. 

rules—the proposal and the Board’s response 
and recommendation are published in our 
proxy statement for review at the Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders. 

In 2011, shareholders or groups owning more 
than 4 billion—or nearly 82 percent—of the 
outstanding shares were represented at the 
Corporation’s Annual Meeting. We engage in 
constructive dialogue with our shareholders 
on a variety of issues throughout the year. For 
example, the Episcopal Church submitted a 
shareholder proposal on community environ-
mental impact the past few years. ExxonMobil 
met with a representative from this organization 
in October 2011 to discuss ways to enhance 
community engagement at the Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, facility. We offered the representa-
tive an opportunity to visit an ExxonMobil site 
there to talk with local community members. 
As a result of these activities, the shareholder 
proposal was not submitted for the 2012 
Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

vesting requirements and risk of forfeiture of 
stock awards, ensures that senior executives 
have a strong ﬁ nancial incentive to protect 
the safety and security of our employees, 
the communities and environment in which 
we operate, and the sustainable value of the 
company for shareholders.

The Compensation Committee carefully 
considered the results of the 2011 advisory 
vote on executive compensation in which 
67 percent of the votes cast were in favor of 
the company’s compensation program. The 
Committee considered shareholder feedback 
on executive compensation received through 
a wide-ranging dialogue between manage-
ment and shareholders. A more detailed 
description of the company’s dialogue with 
shareholders and considerations by the 
Compensation Committee regarding the 
advisory say-on-pay vote is on page 33 of 
the company proxy issued April 12, 2012.

Communicating with directors. ExxonMobil’s 
directors encourage open and transparent 
communication on corporate citizenship topics. 
Individuals can email our non-employee direc-
tors through the Corporate Governance page 
of our website or send written correspondence 
in care of the Secretary of the Corporation. 
ExxonMobil employees work closely with 
directors in responding to these letters and 
emails. Directors sometimes request that 
senior managers meet with shareholders to 
address particular topics. 

Shareholder relations
Every year, shareholders submit proposals 
regarding ExxonMobil’s policies or opera-
tions for inclusion in our proxy statement. 
Typically, managers and the Board con-
sider these proposals and the Corporation 
engages the proposal sponsor in a dialogue. 
If the Corporation and the sponsor reach a 
consensus, the proposal is often withdrawn. 
Otherwise—and unless excluded under 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 

 
 
 
 
 
Internal audits. Regular internal audits and 
self-assessments help ensure the rigor-
ous implementation of our control systems 
and Standards. ExxonMobil’s internal audit 
team of more than 200 well-trained auditors 
annually audit about one-third of ExxonMobil’s 
operations, conducting detailed assessments of 
facilities, business units, personnel, and records, 
and thoroughly investigating noncompliance 
with the Standards. These audits are conducted 
across all functions of the Corporation. 

Bribery and corruption. Anti-corruption 
practices are an essential component of our 
compliance program, given that we operate 
globally and in many challenging environ-
ments. The Anti-Corruption Legal Compliance 
Summary outlines ExxonMobil’s commitment to 
comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act (FCPA), the United Kingdom Bribery Act, 
and global anti-corruption standards in all 
business relationships. ExxonMobil employees 
and contractors are prohibited from making 
payments to, or engaging in transactions with, 
government ofﬁ cials to improperly inﬂ uence the 
performance of their ofﬁ cial duties. Maintaining 
internal controls and keeping accurate and 
complete transaction records are required. Our 
standard language for procurement contracts 
includes a requirement to comply with all laws 
and keep accurate books and records, and 
where appropriate, contains speciﬁ c anti-brib-
ery commitments. For more information, please 
see the case study on integrity in the supply 
chain (page 36). 

Training. Oil and gas exploration and pro-
duction often take us to remote parts of the 
world, with changing political and regula-
tory climates. In 2011, approximately 13,400 
employees took part in anti-corruption training. 
This training covers the basics of the FCPA, 
the United Kingdom Bribery Act, global anti-
corruption standards, recent developments 
in enforcement, and compliance with our 
internal anti-corruption policy, guidelines, and 
processes. Employees in positions assessed 
to be higher-risk receive live training every 
year and within three months of entering their 
positions. Every two years, managers and pro-
fessional employees not in higher-risk positions 
receive training. Every four years and in 2012, 
all employees will attend mandatory half-day 
Business Practices Reviews that include anti-
corruption issues. ExxonMobil believes that 
face-to-face training is the most effective way to 
train employees in anti-corruption compliance; 
almost all anti-corruption training is conducted 
in an interactive live session. Additionally, we 
monitor world events and political changes and 
advise employees as appropriate. 

Systems and practices for reporting viola-
tions. We reinforce our commitment to ethics 
and high standards of business conduct 
with the expectation for all employees to 

report suspected violations of laws and 
company policies. The Corporation provides 
several conﬁ dential mechanisms for report-
ing, including a 24-hour phone number and 
mailing address. Employees can also report 
violations as a part of supervisory reviews. 
Conﬁ dentiality is respected throughout the 
investigation process, subject to legal require-
ments; penalizing or threatening an employee 
for ﬁ ling a report is prohibited. A Hotline 
Steering Committee comprising security, 
audit, law, and human resources personnel 
reviews all reports of suspected violations. 
The Committee provides a quarterly report to 
the Audit Committee, including any violations 
or major issues. Violations lead to disciplinary 
actions, including dismissal.

Global management standards 
and approaches
Our internal management systems help identify, 
track, and report the metrics that demonstrate 
and guide our performance. These systems 
enable us to comply with new regulations; where 
laws and regulations do not exist, they provide a 
framework for maintaining our high standards. 

Operations Integrity Management System. 
The Operations Integrity Management System 
(OIMS) establishes common expectations for 
addressing safety, security, health, envi-
ronmental, and social risks. OIMS provides 
a systematic, structured, and disciplined 
approach to measure progress and track 
accountability across business lines, facilities, 
and projects. We evaluate opportunities to 
improve the OIMS Framework every ﬁ ve years 
and make regular upgrades and adjustments. 
In 2011, Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, 
Inc., reviewed our ongoing performance and 
attested that OIMS is consistent with the 
standard on environmental management 
systems of the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO 14001:2004) and the 
Occupational Health and Safety Assessment 
Series for health and safety management 
systems (OHSAS 18001:2007). For information 
on how we implement OIMS across our opera-
tions, please see the Kearl site tour (page 10), 
the case study on integrity in our supply chain 
(page 36), and the Singapore site tour (page 48).

Control systems. ExxonMobil’s System of 
Management Control Basic Standards deﬁ nes 
essential principles and concepts that drive 
our business controls. Our Controls Integrity 
Management System is designed to assess 
and measure ﬁ nancial control risks, including 
procedures for mitigating concerns, monitor-
ing compliance with standards, and reporting 
results to the appropriate operations and 
management groups within ExxonMobil. These 
company-wide ﬁ nancial controls meet or 
exceed the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act and NYSE listing standards. 

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     35

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP conducted an 
independent assessment that determined our 
internal controls system is effective for ﬁ nancial 
reporting. Regular self-assessments and audits 
help ensure that every operating unit consis-
tently implements our controls and standards. 

Political advocacy and 
contributions
ExxonMobil supports policies that promote 
stable investment climates for long-term 
business viability. ExxonMobil makes political 
contributions to candidate committees, political 
parties, associations, and other political organi-
zations, as permitted by applicable laws in the 
United States and Canada, and as authorized 
by the Board of Directors. The Corporation 
refrains from making political contributions 
in any nation other than the United States or 
Canada. In 2011, Exxon Mobil Corporation 
contributed a total of $226,700 to legislative 
and gubernatorial candidates and caucuses in 
14 U.S. states. Information about our political 
activities, policy, guidelines, and an itemized list 
of corporate political contributions are available 
on our website. ExxonMobil’s employee- and 
retiree-funded political action committee (PAC) 
disbursed $631,500 to federal candidates 
in 2011. Based on these contributions, CQ 
Moneyline listed the ExxonMobil PAC No. 84 in 
size compared to other PACs. Among corporate 
PACs, the ExxonMobil PAC ranked No. 33 in 
size in terms of receipts from employees and 
retiree shareholders, and No. 36 in size of total 
contributions to candidates. All rankings are 
compiled from publicly available data ﬁ led with 
the Federal Election Commission.

ExxonMobil, like many U.S. companies, labor 
unions, and other entities, lobbies the U.S. 
Congress and state legislatures, and com-
plies fully with regulations by reporting federal 
lobbying expenses in quarterly disclosure 
reports to Congress. In 2011, ExxonMobil 
reported lobbying expenses of $12.7 million. 
CQ Moneyline ranked ExxonMobil No. 21 for 
lobbying expenses. We lobbied on a number 
of public policy topics, including energy 
policy, trade, taxes, pipeline safety, security, 
and climate policy. 

ExxonMobil also engages with trade associa-
tions at the national, state, and local levels. 
Participation in these organizations helps 
support our positions on issues critical to 
the shareholders’ interests. Some of the 
support we provide to trade associations may 
be used for lobbying activities. ExxonMobil 
requires trade associations to report to us the 
portion of dues used for lobbying purposes; 
we include these amounts in quarterly public 
Lobby Disclosure Act ﬁ lings.

CASE STUDY

Integrity in our Supply Chain

Third parties providing services to ExxonMobil can impact our operations and reputation. Currently 
we rely on more than 175,000 suppliers of goods and services, including more than 85,000 third-
party contractor personnel. Because our global reach expands well beyond our fence lines, we seek 
and develop relationships with suppliers that uphold our commitment to operations integrity. 

Our supply chain management process 
begins when any of ExxonMobil’s business 
lines identiﬁ es operational or project needs 
requiring the procurement of third-party 
goods, services, or materials. We apply a 
standardized procurement approach that 
allows our operations to share the same 
rigorous standards, accountability, and best 
practices worldwide. Our procurement staff 
is trained to conduct supplier prequaliﬁ cation 
assessments, which include anti-corruption 
due diligence where appropriate, perform 
restricted parties screening, and incorporate 
standard legal terms and conditions into 
contracts. After pre-qualiﬁ cation, our pro-
curement professionals communicate project 
expectations or operational requirements 
that a potential or existing supplier must 
meet. We use procurement plans to describe 
our needs and recommend methods to 
achieve them. 

Supplier qualiﬁ cations
ExxonMobil has in place a disciplined 
qualiﬁ cation process for suppliers. Once the 
business line has determined the operational 
requirements, procurement clearly com-
municates those requirements to potential 
suppliers and incorporates the operational 
requirements into the proposed agreement. 

This process is used whether ExxonMobil 
is procuring a pump for a reﬁ nery, janito-
rial services at an ofﬁ ce building, or hiring 
a fabricator to build an offshore structure. 
Potential suppliers and their capabilities 
are then assessed based on operational 
criticality and level of risk associated 
with the material or service required. 
Considerations include:

•  Health and safety requirements;

•  Technical requirements;

•  Environmental requirements;

•  Emergency response capabilities;

•  Security and human rights standards;

•  Design, construction, and project assur-
ance and procedures; 

•  Product quality assurance, including 
product stewardship;

•  Supplier operating, maintenance, and 
control processes; and,

•  Financial qualiﬁ cations.

Additionally, supplier selection takes into 
account both regulatory and ExxonMobil 
policies regarding local hiring, material 
use, supplier diversity, indigenous peoples 
support, historically underutilized seg-
ments of the population, and the local 

economy. We comply with speciﬁ c sup-
plier-related requirements in each country 
where we operate. 

When selecting a supplier, we evaluate the 
bids submitted and make a determination 
based on quality, technical capabilities, and 
cost. When we are procuring a component 
for a speciﬁ c project, the safety and viability 
of the project may rely on assurances of 
product quality. For example, if we need 
to purchase pipe for one of our upstream 
projects, we perform extensive analysis and 
testing to conﬁ rm that the pipe complies 
with project speciﬁ cations. For further infor-
mation on some of these standards, see the 
Nigeria pipeline example (page 41). 

Local supplier development
It is one of ExxonMobil’s priorities to consider 
local suppliers as part of our project agree-
ments with host countries. We want to build 
and maintain globally competitive supply 
chain infrastructure wherever we operate to 
enhance supply chain security and reduce 
operational risk. Helping develop local suppli-
ers to service the oil and gas industry is part 
of our national content strategy. For more 
information, see page 41.

SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY 

Our Statement on Labor and the Workplace 
articulates our support for the principles 
of the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, namely the 
elimination of child labor, forced labor, and 
workplace discrimination, and the recogni-
tion of the right to freedom of association 
and collective bargaining. Through our 
regimented procurement process, we seek 
business partners that observe similar 
standards. Purchases arranged for by our 
global procurement organization typically 
include contract language that requires 
adherence to all applicable laws and 
regulations, which would include all laws 
and regulations regarding safety, security, 

health, the environment, and human rights. 
Furthermore, requests for quotations 
issued by our procurement staff typically 
include clauses relating to the prohibition 
of forced or child labor and the payment 
of wages in accordance with local laws. 
Participants in such tenders are required to 
adhere to those requirements as a condi-
tion of participating in the tender process.

An additional means of managing supply 
chain transparency involves auditing. A 
typical clause in our contracts requires sup-
pliers and all their subcontractors to allow 
ExxonMobil access to all ofﬁ ces and work 
locations, to interview supplier and subcon-
tractor personnel, and to make and retain 

copies of any records concerning compli-
ance with contract requirements and the law. 
We select a certain percentage of suppliers 
annually for such audits, which include a 
compliance review on contract provisions.

Human trafﬁ cking issues have received 
considerable attention in recent years. 
ExxonMobil proactively manages supply 
chain risks, including those associated with 
human trafﬁ cking, through our Standards 
of Business Conduct and Statement on 
Labor and the Workplace. We also seek to 
reduce the underlying conditions that lead 
to human trafﬁ cking by working to engender 
economic growth and personal prosperity in 
areas that otherwise offer few opportunities.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
ExxonMobil “Buddy Manager System” 

We expect third parties working for us to perform in a manner consistent and compatible 
with ExxonMobil’s policies and business objectives. One best practice called the “Buddy 
Manager System” is becoming widespread across our operations for enhancing the 
company-supplier relationship. Each primary supplier is assigned an ExxonMobil “buddy” 
who acts as a mentor, helping the individual or ﬁ rm set performance objectives. “Buddies” 
provide advice and guidance, and help suppliers build accountability with ExxonMobil. At 
the Baytown Manufacturing complex, Rescar works as a third-party contractor providing 
railcar switching and repair services. The assigned ExxonMobil “Buddy Manager” works 
closely with Rescar senior management and the on-site team on improving the design 
and effectiveness of Rescar’s safety program. The ExxonMobil “Buddy Manager” con-
ducts periodic ﬁ eld visits and site walk-throughs to verify and ensure Rescar is properly 
implementing safety plans. Over the years, this collaboration has signiﬁ cantly improved 
Rescar’s safety performance at the Baytown complex. At many of our locations, we have 
several suppliers that work in similar capacities. We encourage collaboration on safety 
issues among these partners, as it helps improve performance and encourage innovation.

Supplier monitoring
We use OIMS to manage risk across our 
operations. The OIMS Framework estab-
lishes expectations for managing and 
mitigating safety, security, health, environ-
mental, and social risks in every aspect of 
our business, including our supply chain.

After selecting suppliers, each business line 
is responsible for managing the supplier 
relationship. Implementing OIMS Element 8—
Third-Party Services—calls for the moni-
toring and stewardship of third-party 
performance. We provide feedback to 
suppliers, and when necessary, request that 
they correct deﬁ ciencies. In certain cases, 
we terminate the contractual relationship if 
performance does not meet expectations. 

Improving supply chain 
sustainability
ExxonMobil is working with our suppliers to 
identify sustainable alternatives throughout the 
supply chain. Our procurement organization’s 
Total System Cost approach is intended to 
identify and reduce waste and inefﬁ ciency in 
the supply chain. Additionally, we are assess-
ing sustainability certiﬁ cations for suppliers, 
products, and services. Our global procure-
ment organization has begun training staff 
speciﬁ cally on sustainability considerations in 
our purchase-to-pay processes and we aim to 
align sustainability efforts with major suppliers.

MINORITY- AND WOMEN-OWNED 
BUSINESSES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 

We cultivate diversity across our supply 
chain through our U.S.-based Supplier 
Diversity Program. This initiative proac-
tively includes qualiﬁ ed minority- and 
women-owned business enterprises 
(MWBEs) in our procurement sourcing 
process. In 2011, we achieved a signiﬁ -
cant milestone of purchasing materials 
and services worth $869 million in direct 
spend and $181 million in spend lever-
aged through contracts where suppliers 
purchase from MWBEs on our behalf, 
for a total annual spend of over $1 billion. 
In 2012, we will continue to grow our busi-
ness relationships with over 1500 MWBEs 
in the United States and look for opportu-
nities in other parts of the world for similar 
supplier diversity programs.

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     39

ExxonMobil is committed to developing local economic capacity in a way that beneﬁ ts people, com-
munities, and our business over the long term. This strategic objective is embedded into our project 
plans. Supporting strong local economies where we operate enables economic growth and positively 
affects community health, education, gender equality, security, and environmental protection.

Contributing to economic growth 
Poverty, restricted access to education, 
insufﬁ cient business and technical skills, 
lack of employment opportunities, and 
corruption are just a few of the barriers to 
economic growth in many countries where 
ExxonMobil operates. These barriers will not 
be eliminated through aid alone, but through 
the creation of business frameworks that 
enable the development of local economies 
through skills development, job creation, and 
opportunities for investment. These issues 
are complex, and the private sector is limited 
in its ability to address them. Forming global 
partnerships is one part of creating long-
term beneﬁ ts for local communities. 

In 2000, the United Nations adopted eight 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
aimed at improving living conditions and 
opportunities for the world’s poorest people. 
As we expand our operations in developing 
countries, ExxonMobil has the opportunity 
to help catalyze economic development 
and support local efforts that make prog-
ress toward the MDGs. Achieving these 
goals depends on access to modern energy 
sources—a central aspect of our business. 

Transparency
As a core part of our commitment to maintain-
ing the highest standards of ethical behavior, 
we actively support transparent government 
revenue reporting, a responsibility we share 
with our extractive industry peers. 

We recognize that public disclosure of pay-
ments companies make to governments 
and governmental use of those payments 
strengthens accountability and good gov-
ernance, reduces corruption, and promotes 
greater economic stability. To achieve the 
shared goal of revenue transparency, we 
participate in transparency capacity building 
initiatives, as well as a variety of multistake-
holder discussions.

Since 2006, we have provided in-kind support 
of TRACE International workshops in Chad 
and Equatorial Guinea. TRACE conducts 
two-day anti-bribery law events that begin 
with a workshop for the local staff of TRACE 
member companies, including ExxonMobil 
and their local contractors, and conclude 
with a high-level anti-bribery compliance 
forum designed for government ofﬁ cials of 
the host country. These events, which draw 
the full support and participation of local 

ExxonMobil management and staff, help local 
governments and contractors understand and 
comply with international anti-corruption con-
ventions. We plan to work with TRACE in 2012 
to conduct another workshop in West Africa. 

In August 2011, ExxonMobil participated in 
a Revenue Watch Institute capacity building 
program, hosted by the Catholic University 
of Central Africa in Yaoundé, Cameroon. 
The program brought together almost 
40 civil society representatives from eight 
African countries. ExxonMobil presented 
on a variety of topics to provide partici-
pants with a business perspective of the 
basic knowledge and tools for responsible 
revenue management and reporting. We will 
continue participating in similar programs 
around the world to help develop global 
transparency practices.

ExxonMobil has actively participated in 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI) since its inception in 2002 at both the 
secretariat and country levels, including 
continuous participation on the EITI board as 
either a primary or alternate member. Nearly 
20 countries where we have operations are in 
the process of becoming, or have become, 
EITI members. The Corporation is supporting 
the application, validation, and membership 
processes of EITI participating countries 
such as Azerbaijan, Cameroon, Chad, 
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, and Norway 
and of potential new EITI countries including 
Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Papua 
New Guinea, and the United States. 

ExxonMobil’s practical experience imple-
menting EITI has shown that the best 
results are obtained when countries begin 
their disclosure processes in line with their 
own legislation, culture, and traditions, 
and adopt simple and straightforward 
mechanisms that ensure multistakeholder 
engagement and commitments. The level 
of aggregation and granularity of disclosure 
needs to consider each country’s laws and 
capacity. It also needs to protect indi-
vidual companies’ proprietary information. 
Where disaggregated industry reporting is 
required, we work with that government and 
other interested parties. 

Excessively detailed and disaggregated 
disclosure would necessitate the develop-
ment of a separate set of global systems 
to capture, calculate, allocate, aggregate, 
and validate the data in ways that would not 

materially support transparency objectives. 
ExxonMobil estimates that project-speciﬁ c 
reporting could be both costly and difﬁ cult 
to implement. We believe that transparency 
disclosure rules should be written so as to not 
conﬂ ict with host country laws or contractual 
obligations. Project-speciﬁ c disclosure called 
for in the Dodd-Frank ﬁ nancial reform could 
place certain publicly traded, private sector 
companies at a competitive disadvantage 
from securing new business opportunities, 
both by disclosing sensitive commercial data 
and by imposing different reporting standards 
on private versus state-owned companies. 

National content
Promoting social and economic development 
in the communities and countries where we 
operate is a business imperative. ExxonMobil 
works to build local capacity and sustain 
economic growth beyond the life cycle of 
our projects through comprehensive national 
content development programs. 

We design national content programs around 
three focus areas: workforce development, 
supplier development, and strategic commu-
nity investments. We work collaboratively with 
host governments and other stakeholders 
to implement national content initiatives. To 
ensure a systematic, long-term approach, we 
integrate national content into overall project 
execution through the ExxonMobil Capital 
Projects Management System (EMCAPS). 

Every new upstream project in an emerg-
ing market must develop a project-speciﬁ c 
national content plan. A plan consists of goals 
and objectives, an outline of the approach 
and requirements for the three focus areas, 
performance monitoring, and reporting. We 
integrate these plans into our day-to-day 
operating procedures, project strategies, and 
procurement efforts. 

Our National Content Development—
Guidelines, Strategies, and Best Practices 
Guidebook contains the key elements of a 
national content strategy and plan; models 
and tools for the successful development of 
national content; and roles and responsibilities 
at the corporate, country, and project levels. 

ExxonMobil operates in countries with a 
diverse range of needs, challenges, and 
requirements. We carefully assess the social 
and economic conditions of each country 
and consider local factors such as regula-
tory requirements, local development goals,

The Enterprise Development Center in Astana, 
Kazakhstan, has provided training to about 
9000 local entrepreneurs since 2005. In 2011, 
ExxonMobil launched a new training center in 
Atyrau to develop suppliers in Kazakhstan’s oil 
and gas region.

stakeholder expectations, business environ-

incorporate the results of these assessments 
into our national content planning. During 
2012, we plan to further reﬁ ne national content 
planning, roles and responsibilities, and 
national content integration within EMCAPS.

Workforce development
At ExxonMobil, workforce development 
means growing our pool of diverse and 
talented employees by recruiting and training 
locally. Where pertinent, our contracts include 
requirements that contractors and suppliers 
hire and train a national workforce. Our goal 
is not only to maximize recruiting, but also 
to develop and build workforce capacity, 
including technical experts and leaders who 
can add value locally and compete globally. 
To achieve this goal, our national content pro-
grams must overcome obstacles in identifying 
and attracting skilled labor and profession-
als, matching workforce skills to business 
requirements, and retaining and developing a 
local workforce over the long term.

Local hiring. We believe we have a responsi-
bility to build a legacy of economic progress 
by providing local employment opportunities, 
and investing in the workforce of our host 
countries. While local employment helps 
us meet our hiring needs, it also advances 
economic development and education in the 
countries where we operate. We implement a 
set of best practices to support local hiring, 
including on-campus recruiting, employee 
networking, trade organizations, referrals, and 
external search ﬁ rms. Such practices have 
brought the percentage of nationals in our 
workforce in Kazakhstan to nearly 73 percent. 
By 2013, we expect Russian nationals to 
make up nearly 90 percent of the workforce 
at our Sakhalin operations. And, in Malaysia, 
97 percent of our workforce is Malaysian, with 
30 percent women. We aim to advance many 
of the host country nationals we train and 
hire through our national content program 
into roles in other countries to further develop 
their industry knowledge. 

In 2011, approximately 61 percent of our 
employees were located outside the United 
States. ExxonMobil expatriates (individuals 
working in a country other than their country 
of permanent residence) share their expertise 
and train and mentor nationals for operational 
and leadership roles. In 2011, expatriates 
accounted for approximately 5 percent of our 
global workforce. 

Training and development. Rigorous train-
ing and development programs allow us to 
meet local hiring objectives and develop local 
workforces. We use a proven global train-
ing curriculum customized to our operational 

environment. Training typically covers 
ExxonMobil culture, ethics, and business 
practices; safety practices; environmental 
regulations; the English language; skill and 
facility-speciﬁ c training; work assignments and 
on-the-job training; and mentoring and coach-
ing. Over the long term, this helps us develop a 
pool of talented employees to meet future busi-
ness needs both locally and around the world.

In Angola, we work strategically to achieve 
our recruitment targets and to develop local 
employees to their maximum potential. 
Technical students take part in a two- to 
three-year intensive training program that 
includes traveling to Canada for specialized 
technical training. In 2011, 31 production 
technicians completed the 18-month course 
and moved to on-the-job training. An addi-
tional 40 technicians began training in August 
2011. We invite high-potential local employees 
to work on projects with other ExxonMobil 
afﬁ liates to expose them to new opportuni-
ties and enhance their leadership abilities. 
Since 2007, the proportion of local Angolan 
employees to expatriate employees has been 
steadily increasing. In 2011, Angolans made 
up 72 percent of our local workforce. 

Another example of capacity building is the 
technical skills development of local com-
munities. ExxonMobil determined that young 
Nigerians, especially those living in the oil 
production areas of the country, lacked the 
education and technical skills necessary 
to compete for oil and gas industry jobs. 
To address this, we established a techni-
cal training center in Eket, which has over 
time produced a large part of ExxonMobil’s 
Nigerian workforce and has provided skilled 
staff for other employers as well. To date, we 
have hired nearly 500 process, mechanical, 
instrumentation, and electrical graduates from 
the training center. More than 90 percent of our 
approximately 2000 employees in Nigeria are 
nationals.

In Indonesia, our afﬁ liate, Mobil Cepu Limited, 
is developing a national workforce to operate 
and manage the Banyu Urip central processing 
facilities, pipeline, and ﬂ oating offshore storage 
terminal. The training program was established 
in 2007 utilizing a training center located at 
Cepu. It takes approximately 15 months to 
complete the English language and basic oil 
and gas skills training program. The trainees 
then move into production operations to 
continue to acquire skills and competencies 
for operating and maintaining the facility 
equipment. The program also involves train-
ing at similar production operation facilities 
overseas, including the United States and 
Canada. This training program speciﬁ cally 
meets the Indonesian government’s objective 
to develop and maximize the country’s employ-
ment opportunities. 

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     41

Ongoing corporate and technical training 
facilitates career development for all of our 
employees. In 2011, our major business lines 
together spent more than $79.9 million on 
employee training, reaching more than 
65,000 participants. To strengthen our 
company’s technical capacity, approximately 
39,000 participants attended more than 
4600 professional technical training ses-
sions. In addition, more than 3800 employees 
at various management levels participated 
in ExxonMobil’s leadership development 
training programs in 2011, 27 percent of 
whom were women and 60 percent non-U.S. 
employees. Our Upstream Technical Training 
Center is one of several world-class centers 
that deliver training programs every year on 
topics ranging from integrated exploration 
to reservoir simulation to fast-drill borehole 
management.

Supplier development
Supplier development programs ensure that our 
procurement activities strengthen host country 
economies and promote ExxonMobil as a 
partner of choice. Our ultimate goal is to build 
and maintain a reliable and globally competi-
tive supply chain wherever we operate. This 
means overcoming obstacles such as limited 
infrastructure and inadequate ﬁ nancing for local 
businesses, and often requires helping our sup-
pliers meet our safety standards. 

In 2011, a local manufacturer delivered and 
installed 2000 metric tons of specialized 
steel pipeline in the Edop-Idoho ﬁ eld offshore 
Nigeria, representing the ﬁ rst time the oil and 
gas industry has used pipe made in-country 
for an offshore application. ExxonMobil’s 
Nigerian afﬁ liate Mobil Producing Nigeria 
worked for more than four years with the 
manufacturer and a government agency to 
prepare the contractor to meet our speciﬁ ca-
tions. This partnership has led to contracts 
creating hundreds of direct and indirect jobs 
for Nigerians. The local manufacturer has 
pending orders for more than 100 kilometers 
of specialized pipe, and it plans to continue 
to apply international technical standards as 
they work to meet local demand with globally 
competitive quality.

The limited local fabrication capacity in Nigeria, 
along with strict certiﬁ cation standards, had 
been obstacles in establishing local manufac-
turing capacity in the past. To overcome these 
hurdles, ExxonMobil arranged for joint visits 
with the manufacturer’s employees to South 
Africa and South Korea to study mill facili-
ties and materials procurement approaches. 
They also sent contractor employees to the 
United States to learn more about engineer-
ing standards. In Nigeria, ExxonMobil retained 
experienced inspectors to train the manu-
facturer in proper pipe-milling procedures. 

ExxonMobil promotes opportunities to develop the skills and experience of our local suppliers. Above, 
ExxonMobil’s Nigerian afﬁ liate, Mobil Producing Nigeria, works with government ofﬁ cials to inspect the fabri-
cation yard of locally sourced pipeline. 

International contractors participated as well in 
establishing local sources for iron ore for pipe 
coating and developing highly-skilled welders. 
As a result, extensive tests performed both 
locally and internationally on the pipes manu-
factured in Nigeria conﬁ rmed that they met or 
exceeded our technical speciﬁ cations. 

In some cases, ExxonMobil can best 
address infrastructure demands and develop 
local capacity by working with suppliers as a 
group. We have launched enterprise centers 
in Chad, Kazakhstan, and Papua New 
Guinea that develop the capacity of local 
suppliers and improve their business skills. 
The Papua New Guinea liqueﬁ ed natural gas 
(PNG LNG) project opened an Enterprise 
Center in April 2010, and this past year 
received their ﬁ rst independent contract to 
conduct staff training. 

In 2005, ExxonMobil’s afﬁ liate, ExxonMobil 
Kazakhstan Inc., established an Enterprise 
Development Center (EDC) in the capital 

city, Astana, to help achieve the local govern-
ment’s goal to diversify the economy beyond 
the oil and gas industry and support the 
development of small- and medium-sized 
businesses. Starting with ExxonMobil and 
the United States Agency for International 
Development’s joint sponsorship, the Astana 
EDC during the past six years has pro-
vided training through International Labor 
Organization (ILO) certiﬁ ed technicians to 
9000 entrepreneurs with a focus on female 
entrepreneurs. Based on the success of the 
center in Astana, ExxonMobil opened another 
EDC in 2011 in the oil and gas producing 
region of Atyrau, a traditionally underserved 
region of the country. Atyrau EDC plans 
to train more than 1600 entrepreneurs by 
year-end 2012. This initiative reinforces 
ExxonMobil’s commitment to developing the 
local economy. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Workforce development in Papua New Guinea

At our PNG LNG project, we are exceeding our workforce forecast for Papua New Guinea 
nationals. The current construction workforce includes more than 8500 Papua New Guinean 
workers, approximately 60 percent of the total construction workforce. Training local workers 
is an essential element of our Papua New Guinea-speciﬁ c national content plan. 

In 2011, six engineers from our Graduate Training Development program began operations 
and maintenance technician training. Our next nine recruits, including one woman, will 
begin their program in 2012. 

Gerard Schulze, one of our ﬁ rst Papua New Guinean graduates, with a 
degree in mechanical engineering, described his experience. “When I started 
I had very little to no experience with the process and chemical engineering 
ﬁ elds so it was a bit intimidating. The amount of manuals and documents that 
I had to read and understand in order to get up to speed with the process 
side of things was very overwhelming at ﬁ rst. However, with the help of fellow engineers 
and technical training, things began to pick up. I look forward to the many challenges and 
career development opportunities that are yet to come.” For more information on our work-
force development, visit pnglng.com.

IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIC COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS

Corporate Level Initiatives: 2011 Highlights

ExxonMobil Malaria Initiative. Last year, 
with support from ExxonMobil, Malaria 
No More’s NightWatch program reached 
more than 5 million Cameroonians with 
educational messages about bed-net use. 
Partnering with local celebrities and 
community leaders, a message to remind 
people to use bed nets is broadcast at 9 p.m. 
each night when mosquitos take ﬂ ight. 
During 2012 this program will be imple-
mented in other African countries. Please 
visit exxonmobil.com/malaria.

Math and Science Initiative. In 2011, 
Astronaut Bernard Harris traveled to Africa 
to encourage more than 1000 students to 
reach their dreams by studying science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
Dr. Harris also met with community leaders, 
educators, and key policy makers to discuss 
the need for strong STEM initiatives and the 
positive effects they bring. Learn more about 
this historic visit, as well as other ExxonMobil 
programs supporting math and science edu-
cation at exxonmobil.com/citizenship.

Women’s Economic Opportunity Initiative.
A new partnership with the Cherie Blair 
Foundation for Women will begin with 
comprehensive research on cellular phone 
technology. The ﬁ ndings from this research 
will identify mobile phone applications to 
advance women’s economic opportunities. 
During the second phase of the project these 
applications will be piloted in three countries: 
Nigeria, Egypt, and Indonesia. Please visit 
exxonmobil.com/womensinitiative. 

Focus on malaria prevention and control. International health 
ofﬁ cials estimate malaria kills nearly 655,000 people annually—most 
of them pregnant women and children under the age of ﬁ ve. In addi-
tion to the tremendous human costs, this disease leads to losses of 
productivity and economic opportunity in developing economies. 
Since 2000, ExxonMobil and the ExxonMobil Foundation have con-
tributed more than $111 million toward the ﬁ ght against malaria. Our 
funding has allowed our projects and operations to reach more than 
66 million people by training nearly 180,000 healthcare workers and 
providing 13.1 million bed nets, 1.6 million doses of anti-malarial 
drugs, and more than 875,000 rapid diagnostic kits. We also bring 
our expertise in business management to ensure desired results are 

achieved. The World Health Organization’s World Malaria Report 
2010 shows a 10-percent decline in global malaria deaths between 
2008 and 2009. While we are seeing some success in ending 
deaths from malaria, there is still more work to be done. 

In 2011, we awarded around $11 million to more than 25 organiza-
tions across Africa and in the Asia Paciﬁ c region. Work funded by 
these grants includes many types of malaria prevention and control 
initiatives like research into malaria vaccines and treatments and 
improved malaria prevention education. For example, $500,000 
went to support a malaria diagnostic laboratory in Ghana, to 
beneﬁ t efforts in the region. 

Strategic community 
investments
Through public-private partnerships and 
ongoing stakeholder engagement, we work 
to improve social and economic conditions 
wherever we operate. This is the third element 
of our national content approach. 

We make strategic community investments 
at both the corporate and country level, and 
each serves different needs. Our corporate 
activities through the ExxonMobil Foundation 
include a focus on three global issues: 
women’s economic participation, advancing 
math and science education, and prevention 
and control of malaria. 

We selected these focus areas based on our 
ability to provide functional support beyond 
check writing, and each is linked closely to 
our continued operations. Women make up 
half the world’s population, yet earn only 
10 percent of the world’s income. Math and 
science are increasingly important in today’s 
careers, yet students’ academic performance 
in these ﬁ elds is declining. Malaria and its 
complications impact the household incomes 
of families in Africa. Each of these pressing 
issues threatens economies and communi-
ties around the world. Helping to address 
these issues enables the communities 
around us to thrive.

Our country-level community investments, 
stewarded locally, represent a key aspect 
of our national content strategy. We focus 
local investments on many of the social and 
economic challenges identiﬁ ed in our national 
content planning process. Around the world, 
country-speciﬁ c investments address needs 
ranging from community water access to 
inoculations against disease. When determin-
ing where and how to invest, we consider the 
development goals of each community and 
the beneﬁ t to our operations. In Angola, we 
align our strategic community investments 
around the Angolan government’s priorities of 
education, health, environment, agriculture, 
and family, which directly impact the individual

Country-Led Initiatives: 2011 Highlights

Mexico. The Ministry of the Environment 
and Centre for Development and 
Population Activities (CEDPA) have formed a 
unique alliance with ExxonMobil to support 
the country and the company’s common 
priorities: environmental stewardship and 
women’s economic participation. 

The week-long workshop focuses on 
training key members of the Ministry 
of Environment's Advisory Council for 
Sustainable Development in order to 
strengthen their communities via diverse 
projects that address a wide range of 
environmental and social issues. Since 
2009, 48 men and women from the Council 
have participated in programs on advocacy, 
gender, and the environment, all of which 
are emerging issues in Mexico.

Indonesia. ExxonMobil’s afﬁ liates created 
a microﬁ nance program to develop the 
entrepreneurial skills of Indonesian women 
living in underprivileged communities. These 
women normally would not qualify for loans 
through Indonesia’s banking system due 
to their lack of a credit history or steady 
employment. Additionally, many Indonesians 
fear negative judgment from taking a bank 
loan. This microﬁ nance program makes 
small collateral-free loans and equips new 
borrowers with ﬁ nancial skills through 
peer mentorship. Through the end of 2011, 
more than 15,000 Indonesian women have 
borrowed approximately $500,000 with 
close to a 100 percent loan performance 
ratio. By helping women overcome cultural 
barriers and gain community recognition, 
the program leads to better outcomes for 
families and the surrounding community. 

well-being and thus the productivity of the 
Angolan work force. For example, more than 
70,000 Angolans now have direct access to 
modern health services, thanks to a $950,000 
contribution to build the ﬁ rst medical center in 
the Andulo municipality, Bié province.

Our worldwide spending includes contribu-
tions to nonproﬁ t organizations; we also 
invest in social projects through various 
joint-venture arrangements, production-shar-
ing agreements, and projects operated by 
others. In 2011, Exxon Mobil Corporation, our 
divisions and afﬁ liates, and the ExxonMobil 
Foundation provided a combined $234 million 
in cash, goods, and services worldwide. Of 
the total, $124 million supported communities 

in the United States and $110 million sup-
ported communities in other countries. For 
more information on both our corporate and 
country-speciﬁ c strategic community invest-
ments, please see our website. 

Employee volunteerism 
and giving
Through company-sponsored volunteer pro-
grams, more than 23,000 ExxonMobil employ-
ees, retirees, and their families donated more 
than 728,900 volunteer hours to 5300 chari-
table organizations in 43 countries in 2011. 
Of this, 11,000 participants donated more than 
168,100 hours to more than 1100 organizations 
in countries outside the United States. 

Employees and retirees donated $44 million 
through ExxonMobil’s matching gift, disaster 
relief, and employee giving programs. This 
includes more than $3.6 million donated by 
ExxonMobil employees, retirees, dealers, and 
distributors to support disaster-relief efforts 
in response to the magnitude 9.0 earthquake 
that hit Japan in 2011. When combined with 
corporate donations, ExxonMobil—together 
with our employees and retirees—contributed 
$278 million to community investments 
worldwide.

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     45

Oil and gas development requires operating in a variety of cultures and economic structures around 
the world. Our approach to engaging with the communities near our sites demonstrates our funda-
mental respect for human rights and our belief that strong, informed communities lead to a stable 
business environment.

Community impacts and 
relationships
Oil and gas projects and operations can affect 
individuals, communities, and the environment. 
We strive to identify and mitigate potentially 
negative impacts and enhance the positive 
outcomes of our activities. By doing our job to 
the highest ethical standards, complying with 
applicable host-country regulatory require-
ments, and respecting local cultures and 
customs, we build supportive relationships in 
the communities where we operate.

ExxonMobil’s upstream socioeconomic man-
agement process covers:

•  Risk assessment and management;

•  Human rights;

•  Community relations;

•  Indigenous peoples;

•  Cultural heritage and diversity;

•  Land use and resettlement;

•  Economic development; and,

•  Transparency and corruption.

We address these issues by adhering to 
corporate policies and expectations (page 
32), complying with host-country regulatory 
requirements, applying universally recognized 
principles, engaging with external groups 
(page 7), and building local economic capacity 
(page 38). 

In 2011, we revised our Upstream 
Socioeconomic Management Standard 
and expanded its application to all of the 
upstream companies. The Standard pro-
vides a set of best management practices 
and minimum expectations for the upstream 
companies. We believe a consistent approach 
helps our contractors, partners, and employ-
ees effectively manage socioeconomic issues 
and maintain our global license to operate. 
We used the recent update as an opportunity 
to enhance the usability of the Standard, 
incorporate progressing international 
protocols and expectations, and expand 
the application of the Standard across 
ExxonMobil’s Upstream business.

Respecting human rights
Our approach to human rights is consistent 
with the policy framework outlined in the 
2008 report of John Ruggie, the U.N. Special 
Representative on Business and Human 
Rights. That framework recognizes the 

distinctly different roles of governments and 
business with regard to human rights—the gov-
ernments’ duty to protect human rights and the 
corporations’ responsibility to respect them. 

The U.N. Framework and Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights were released 
in 2011 to provide further guidance on 
implementing the “protect, respect, remedy” 
framework. These Principles emphasize 
operational due diligence: corporations 
should be aware of potential adverse impacts 
and implement prevention measures. We 
plan to formalize an Upstream Environmental, 
Socioeconomic, and Health Impact 
Assessment (ESHIA) Technical Requirement 
in 2012, and to ensure that our upstream 
projects address any human rights impact 
assessment gaps that may exist. 

Providing human rights training. Our human 
rights awareness training program is based on 
ExxonMobil guidelines, practices, and priorities. 

Training focuses primarily on employee 
awareness, company policies and 
approaches, company resources, and our 
commitment to respect human rights. Each 
session also includes information on the 
Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights, the requirements of our Framework 
on Security and Human Rights, and imple-
menting the Framework in a given country. In 
2011, we continued our approach of provid-
ing human rights training to key afﬁ liates. 
Our focus has been on training lead country 
managers and certain staff. In 2011, such 
training was provided in ﬁ ve countries; we 
also delivered dedicated human rights training 
to a broader scope of employees working in 
Papua New Guinea. 

In 2012, as we work to implement new processes 
and guidance under our revised Upstream 
Socioeconomic Management Standard, we 
also plan to update our human rights training 
to reﬂ ect changing international guidance and 
to reach a broader group of employees. 

Policies and labor practices. Our commitment 
to human rights includes our workforce and 
is supported by our Standards of Business 
Conduct, which is consistent with the spirit 
and intent of the U.N. Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) 1998 Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 

ExxonMobil’s Statement on Labor and the 
Workplace articulates our support for the 
principles of the ILO Declaration, speciﬁ cally 
the elimination of child labor, forced labor, 
and workplace discrimination, and the right 
to freedom of association and collective bar-
gaining. We require all employees to comply 
with our policies. For information on our sup-
pliers, please see the case study on integrity 
in the supply chain (page 36).

Addressing security concerns
Security and respect for human rights can 
and should be compatible. ExxonMobil 
is committed to ensuring the security of 
company personnel and operations in a 
manner that respects human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.

Framework on Security and Human Rights. 
We actively participate in the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights, 
a forum that provides for discussion and 
information-sharing among extractive 
industry sector companies, governments, 
and nongovernmental organizations. These 
Voluntary Principles afﬁ rm the constructive 
role that business can play in supporting and 
advancing human rights and security. 

ExxonMobil’s Statement and Framework on 
Security and Human Rights helps implement 
the Voluntary Principles. The Framework 
includes guidance on working with host 
government security personnel, instituting 
memoranda of understanding regarding host 
government-assigned security personnel, 
developing approaches for interacting with 
private security providers, and reporting and 
putting in place recordkeeping templates. 
Approximately 79 percent of our private secu-
rity personnel contracts include requirements 
to address human rights concerns.

Establishing strong partnerships with the 
local community is the foundation of the 
Papua New Guinea liqueﬁ ed natural gas 
(PNG LNG) project’s security strategy. We 
have faced some security challenges as 
construction continues. We address these 
challenges through the implementation of our 
Security Plan, which is regularly monitored 
and reviewed. Building on our experience 
in Papua New Guinea and other regions, 
ExxonMobil has implemented a range of 
physical security countermeasures and con-
tingency plans.

PNG LNG project team member Marilyn Wingi distributes a community newsletter on the project. Effective 
stakeholder engagement means providing local groups a communication channel to voice concerns related 
to a project.

During 2011, we strengthened security 
measures at our PNG LNG project facilities 
and worked to enhance police presence. To 
help build the skills of Papua New Guinea 
security personnel, selected team members 
attended a Site Security Contact Conference 
in Melbourne, Australia, while others attended 

a specialized maritime safety and rescue 
training course in Brisbane, Australia. We also 
supported a course whereby Royal Papua 
New Guinea Constabulary instructors trained 
line ofﬁ cers on the Voluntary Principles on 
Security and Human Rights. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Papua New Guinea grievance mechanisms

The PNG LNG project uses a grievance process managed by ExxonMobil afﬁ liate, Esso 
Highlands Limited. We capture concerns and complaints from local communities and 
manage them through a computer-based Information Management System (IMS). We 
investigate and respond to every grievance received, tracking and recording all grievances 
through ﬁ nal closure. 

To reach those in the more remote areas of Papua New Guinea potentially affected by the 
project, we introduced a special grievance card. These cards record the same information 
as the IMS, but can be easily used in the ﬁ eld and sent back to the Port Moresby-based 
Community Affairs department for processing. 

Sometimes, after careful analysis, we determine that a grievance relates to third parties 
unrelated to the project. The Papua New Guinea government is working to place govern-
ment ofﬁ cers in the ﬁ eld to assist with such concerns. In other cases, we recognize an area 
for additional focus and work with the grievant to implement a remedy.

As may be expected with a project of this 
scale and complexity, and in a country with 
customary land rights, many community con-
cerns relate to compensation for land access. 
Additionally, access to business develop-
ment and employment opportunities can be 
a source of economic-related grievances. 
This is particularly the case where onshore 
pipelines are being installed. Many jobs 
associated with pipeline construction require 
short-term, highly skilled labor. Local commu-
nities often object to the limited employment 
opportunities available to them as a result. 
Community development projects are 
helping to address these types of concerns. 

Consultation with stakeholders
We aim to help develop human, social, and 
economic capacity in a way that beneﬁ ts 
people, communities, and our business. 
Achieving this goal requires collaborative 
partnerships and active consultation with a 
range of stakeholders. Our Best Practices in 
External Affairs (BPEA) initiative focuses on 
building positive external relationships and 
is our strategic planning and management 
tool for external affairs. It governs community 
awareness programs, government relations, 
and national content development. The BPEA 
process identiﬁ es the speciﬁ c needs, expecta-
tions, and interests of host communities and 
aligns these needs with our community invest-
ment efforts. 

Ensuring mutual understanding, trust, and 
respect in our stakeholder relationships 
means providing local groups and individu-
als with a communication channel to voice 
and resolve concerns related to a develop-
ment project without fear of retribution. Our 
Upstream Socioeconomic Management 
Standard includes provisions for establish-
ing a systematic and transparent grievance 
mechanism process. 

Indigenous peoples. ExxonMobil is commit-
ted to engaging with indigenous communities 
in a manner that is respectful of their cultures 
and customs. Through open consultation, we 
work to understand and incorporate indig-
enous perspectives into project planning, 
design, execution, and ongoing operations. 
Our approach is consistent with the prin-
ciples of the ILO Convention 169 Concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries, the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on 
Environmental and Social Sustainability, and 
the World Bank Operational Policy and Bank 
Procedure on Indigenous Peoples. Our proj-
ects and operations in Alaska, Canada, Papua 
New Guinea, and Sakhalin Island all involve 
working in communities of indigenous peoples.

Often, the ﬁ rst consultation with any group 
of indigenous people is to determine how 
they prefer to be engaged. Each community 
establishes its own preference for how often 
they meet with us, how long, and whom they 
choose to represent the community’s wishes. 
In Alaska, we established a working group 
with the indigenous community in Kaktovik, 
a village of about 300 residents located in 
the region of our North Slope Point Thomson 
project. The working group, comprising 
leadership from Kaktovik and ExxonMobil, 
meets several times a year. At the same 
time, we conduct community meetings, 
open to all residents, twice a year to provide

project updates. At Kearl in Alberta, Canada, 
Imperial Oil consulted with the First Nations’ 
Industry Relations Corporations to develop 
a Reclamation Planning Group. The planning 
group is just one of several mechanisms for 
seeking indigenous input at Kearl (page 10).

We work to respond to community concerns 
throughout the life cycle of a project or opera-
tion. During exploration and development, 
we alter the project design where possible to 
respond to community concerns. In Papua 
New Guinea, we worked with community 
members who practice subsistence ﬁ shing to 
preserve access to local ﬁ shing areas during 
jetty construction and modiﬁ ed project plans 
in order to avoid a popular ﬁ shing reef. 

Once our operations commence, we work 
to mitigate the risk of those operations on 
local populations. For example, in Sakhalin, 
Exxon Neftegas Limited’s (ENL) main opera-
tions are within 20 kilometers of the Uilta, 
an indigenous people of 350 representa-
tives. For many centuries, the Uilta have 
captured wild reindeer, domesticated them, 
and migrated with the herds across northern 
Sakhalin. To support operations on Sakhalin 
Island, ENL built a bridge across Chayvo 
Bay. Before the bridge was built, the reindeer 
herders crossed the bay by boat while their 
reindeer swam. ENL now stops all trafﬁ c to 
allow the herders to access the bridge on 
their annual reindeer drive. 

We are sensitive to our local communities’ 
concerns about balancing their cultural 
heritage with the need for economic devel-
opment, even after our operations have 
ceased. Wherever we work with indigenous 
peoples, we support both local employment 
initiatives and cultural heritage programs 
through national content and strategic com-
munity investments, respectively. In Horn 
River, Canada, we encourage local supplier 
development through procurement and safety 
workshops, while supporting the Annual 
Summer Gathering and Trappers’ Rendezvous 
as part of the First Nations’ efforts to pass 
traditional knowledge from one generation to 
the next. At the same time that we train and 
hire local workers and suppliers in Papua New 
Guinea, we work to preserve the country’s 
signiﬁ cant cultural heritage. To this end, we 
follow a Cultural Heritage Management Plan 
for our project activities and implement a cul-
tural heritage tracking system, which collates 
and manages data collected since 2009. The 
Cultural Heritage Management Plan describes 
procedures for pre-construction surveys and 
the protocol for managing chance-ﬁ nds of 
heritage value. We provide cultural heritage 
awareness and chance-ﬁ nds training for 
applicable project personnel, including infor-
mation on types of Papua New Guinea cultural 

heritage sites and identiﬁ cation, classiﬁ ca-
tion, and documentation of chance-ﬁ nds. We 
train earth-moving equipment operators and 
employ spotters to help recognize and identify 
cultural heritage artifacts and conduct arche-
ological salvage activities at sites discovered 
during pre-construction surveys.

Land use and resettlement. We respect 
property rights in the countries where 
we operate, including those of traditional 
land users. The IFC revised Performance 
Standards, effective in 2012, requires clients 
to obtain the free, prior, and informed consent 
of indigenous peoples before initiating devel-
opment activities on traditional lands. We are 
interested and engaged in the manner these 
new IFC Standards will be implemented.

While the updated Upstream Socioeconomic 
Management Standard includes consider-
ations for securing free, prior, and informed 
consultation, our goal is to obtain the consent 
of local communities and other key impacted 
stakeholders regarding our operations. In 
practice, we strive for broad consensus and 
seek to ensure participative consultation 
as a key part of our planning and operating 
processes.

We minimize involuntary resettlement through 
project design; when resettlement is unavoid-
able, we seek to ensure the appropriate 
restoration of the livelihoods of displaced 
persons. In all cases when resettlement is 
unavoidable (e.g., for our PNG LNG project), 
we apply international best practice aligned 
with the IFC’s Performance Standards, in 
conjunction with applicable host-country 
regulatory requirements. 

When physical and economic displacement 
occurs, we develop and implement resettle-
ment action plans that include landowner 
consultation, and surveying and mapping of 
housing structures, gardens, and other assets. 
In Papua New Guinea, we negotiate appropri-
ate compensation with affected landowners 
or users in the presence of a third-party law 
ﬁ rm provided by the project. The resettled 
landowner or user then identiﬁ es a new home 
and garden site. They are provided assistance 
to re-establish a household and gardens at 
the new location, including the introduction of 
improved agricultural techniques. We conduct 
livelihood restoration activities and monitor 
and evaluate progress for two years against a 
pre-resettlement baseline. Thus far in Papua 
New Guinea, 17 locations were identiﬁ ed 
where resettlement is deemed necessary.

Operations Integrity:
Delivering Value in Downstream 
and Chemical Operations

ExxonMobil’s 
integrated 
Singapore facilities 
produce the 
base materials 
found in products 
used by millions 
of consumers 
every day all 
over the world. 

Employees and contractors at our integrated manufacturing complex in Singapore focus on 
efﬁ cient, safe, and environmentally responsible operations by using worldwide expectations 
established through ExxonMobil’s Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS). This site tour 
captures operations integrity in action, including the challenges of integrated manufacturing.

Overview of the Singapore 
integrated facility
ExxonMobil has operated in Singapore for 
over 40 years. Integration of our reﬁ nery 
and chemical facilities allows us to upgrade 
each molecule to its highest value as 
we leverage the advantages of a global 
functional organization and co-located 
manufacturing. The 605-thousand-barrel-
per-day reﬁ nery produces primarily 
gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, propane, naphtha 
base oil, asphalt, and wax, and serves 
as the chemical plant’s primary source 
of feedstock. The chemical plant in turn 
produces the basic building blocks for 
high-performance plastics and specialty 
chemicals used to make consumer goods 
such as clothing, upholstery, diapers, food 
storage, and cell phones.

Our ongoing, multi-billion-dollar chemical 
plant expansion in Singapore is the largest 
in the history of ExxonMobil Chemical and 
will more than double the plant’s capacity to 
satisfy Asia Paciﬁ c’s growing petrochemical 
demand. When complete, Singapore will be 
ExxonMobil’s highest capacity integrated 
reﬁ ning and chemical complex.

Safety, health, and the 
workplace
Process safety. OIMS Element 2—Risk 
Assessment and Management—requires 
the facility to manage process safety at the 
site through the identiﬁ cation, mitigation, 
and elimination of hazards and risks. 

ExxonMobil uses a comprehensive risk 
assessment process to identify hazards, 
assess risk levels, and follow up to 
ensure risk management decisions are 
implemented. With the philosophy of “we 
cannot ﬁ x what we do not know,” empha-
sis is placed on a healthy risk discovery 
process. Hazard identiﬁ cation comes from 
multiple sources, including operational unit 
hazard reviews, equipment inspections, 
ﬁ eld audits, learnings from incidents and 
near misses, and employee and contrac-
tor input. Workers also undergo on-site, 
hands-on training to ensure they can 
perform the work competently and safely. 
And, we focus on effective procedures, 
including best practices for higher-risk 
activities, such as start-up of operations, 
which is a key area of emphasis as we 
bring new facilities online.

Contractor safety. OIMS Element 8—
Third-Party Services—requires the facility 
to evaluate and select third-party services 
using criteria that include an assessment 
of capabilities to perform work in a safe 
and environmentally sound manner. 

ExxonMobil employees promote their 
safety culture every day. While 2011 
was not an incident-free year, the site 
implemented a series of safety initiatives 
and remains dedicated to the goal of 
achieving zero injuries. The application of 
OIMS principles drives expectations for 
safe performance of our employees and 
contractors.

This petrochemical expansion shows how 
all workers share ExxonMobil’s safety 
values on-site. In mid-2010, the project’s 
on-site workforce peaked at more than 
22,000. Employees and contractors, 
working side-by-side, came from nearly 
30 countries, spanning six continents, 
and speaking more than eight languages. 
Despite these challenges, the expansion 
project workers achieved about 64 million 
cumulative hours worked with no lost-time 
incidents at the end of 2011. 

Employees and contractors are achiev-
ing safety results through programs 
implemented from the start of the 
petrochemical expansion. An on-site 
Safety Training Center helps workers meet 
performance expectations by helping 
them understand hazards and safe work 
practices. Workers must attend and pass 
an Enhanced Safety Orientation Course 
that includes modules on safety induc-
tion and oil and petrochemical safety. We 
use safety leading indicators to steward 
safety performance. Also, employees and 
contractors attend events, such as the 
project’s yearly safety carnival, to refresh 
safety fundamentals.

We recognize safety challenges will arise as 
the site moves from construction to opera-
tions. Our detailed execution plans prepare 
us to address these challenges in a disci-
plined manner, and uphold our commitment 
to safety in every decision we make. 

Environmental performance 
OIMS Element 6—Operations and 
Maintenance—requires operation of 
facilities within established parameters 
and according to regulations, calling for 
effective procedures, structured inspec-
tion and maintenance programs, reliable 
equipment, and qualiﬁ ed personnel to con-
sistently execute procedures and practices.

Singapore is natural-resource constrained, 
which poses operational challenges for land 
use, energy efﬁ ciency, water consump-
tion, and air emissions. ExxonMobil has 
successfully addressed these challenges 
through OIMS by focusing on ﬂ awless 
operations and continuous improvement.

Built primarily on reclaimed land, the 
chemical plant generates the majority of 
its electricity and steam on-site, mostly 
through cogeneration. Once online, the pet-
rochemical expansion is expected to meet 
both plants’ steam and electricity needs 
through additional cogeneration capacity. 

The chemical plant’s third-party vendors 
assist in reusing solid carbon waste. In 2011, 
instead of disposing it into Singapore’s 
limited landﬁ lls, we sent about 6000 metric 
tons, or 30 percent of carbon waste, for 
reuse, mainly for energy recovery purposes.

Freshwater is scarce in Singapore, so 
we reduce its use on-site through innova-
tive measures. In 2011, we completed a 
seawater intake system for the petrochem-
ical expansion. The system will reduce 
potable water consumption and our use of 
water treatment chemicals. The project’s 

2011 Corporate Citizenship Report     49

In addition to addressing community 
concerns, ﬂ aring reductions allow us to 
decrease GHG emissions and efﬁ ciently 
recover our process streams. We plan 
to continue evaluating ﬂ aring sources 
and analyzing system deﬁ ciency items to 
further reduce ﬂ aring in 2012. 

VIGNES SWAMINATHAR
ENERGY LEADER, 
SINGAPORE REFINERY

I start my day by 
reviewing information 
from the data visualiza-
tion program and shift 
superintendent reports 

to understand the previous day’s 
operations. This information is used to 
identify issues related to energy opti-
mization and helps us propose steps 
to improve our performance. Managing 
energy projects can be challenging, 
but it is a fascinating role. I interface 
with engineers from different func-
tions to determine the optimal energy 
projects. My role requires long-term 
planning and looking at the “bigger, 
future picture,” with results often not 
visible in the near term. But it is always 
fulﬁ lling to see what we’ve achieved 
after many months of planning. Not 
only do we generate signiﬁ cant energy 
savings for the plant, but I’m also 
happy to be part of the larger effort to 
help reduce our emissions and envi-
ronmental footprint.

wastewater treatment unit will also use a 
membrane bioreactor to treat wastewater, 
resulting in high-quality efﬂ uent that can 
be recycled and used as cooling water. 

Managing climate change risks
OIMS Element 6 also requires the busi-
ness to establish goals for environmental 
performance, including greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. The facility must identify 
alternatives, if applicable, and employ envi-
ronmental improvement initiatives.

Reducing energy consumption is a part 
of operations integrity. Projects executed 
by Singapore’s Energy Special Emphasis 
Team saved approximately $4.5 million 
in 2011. Since 2002, we have achieved a 
16 percentage-point reduction in energy 
intensity. During 2012, we plan to reduce 
this by another 1 percent.

The ﬂ are system at the Singapore’s inte-
grated site serves as a safety relief valve for 
unplanned interruptions, such as a loss of 
power or the plant being unable to process 
or reﬁ ne recovered materials. In 2010, 
a cross-functional ﬂ are reduction team 
enhanced ﬂ are monitoring and utilization, 
and revitalized the ﬂ are gas compressor 
system. Flare unit engineers monitor and 
troubleshoot the ﬂ are system daily. Site 
management encourages ﬂ aring reduction 
goals and incorporates ﬂ aring topics into 
daily employee operational brieﬁ ngs.

The reﬁ nery’s 40-percent ﬂ are reduction 
in 2010 versus 2009 was equivalent to 
a 14,700 metric ton reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO2). In 2011, the site achieved a 
ﬂ are reduction equal to 7800 metric tons 
of CO2, or 32 percent, compared with 
2010. At the chemical plant, we reduced 
ﬂ aring nearly 50 percent since 2007 and 
12 percent from 2010.

The addition of a second 
world-scale petrochemi-
cal facility in Singapore 
to our existing integrated 
operations will help meet 
increasing demand in Asia.

ASSURANCE STATEMENT

Terms of Engagement. This Assurance 
Statement has been prepared for Exxon 
Mobil Corporation. 

To form our conclusions, the assurance 
was undertaken as a sampling exercise and 
covered the following activities:

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, Inc. 
(LRQA) was commissioned by Exxon Mobil 
Corporation (ExxonMobil) to assure its 
processes used to produce the Corporate 
Citizenship Report for the calendar year 
2011 (hereafter referred to as “the CCR”). 
Our terms of engagement were to review 
the processes for reporting safety, health, 
and environmental core IPIECA performance 
indicators and ExxonMobil-selected additional 
indicators. Verifying the accuracy of data and 
information was not included in the assurance. 

LRQA has reviewed ExxonMobil’s reporting 
processes since 2005 (for the 2004 CCR).

Management Responsibility. ExxonMobil’s 
management was responsible for prepar-
ing the Report and for maintaining effective 
internal controls over the data and informa-
tion disclosed. LRQA’s responsibility was to 
carry out an assurance engagement on the 
Report in accordance with our contract with 
ExxonMobil.

Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, 
and remains the responsibility of ExxonMobil.

LRQA’s Approach. Our veriﬁ cation has 
been conducted against the requirements of 
LRQA’s Report Veriﬁ cation procedure. The 
objectives of the assurance engagement 
were to verify the integrity of the processes 
used to determine material issues for report-
ing, and to evaluate consistency with the 
following industry guidelines: 

•  IPIECA/API, Oil and Gas Industry 
Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability 
Reporting (2010); and,

•  API, Compendium of Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Emission Estimation Methodologies 
for the Oil and Gas Industry (February 2004). 

•  Reviewing the reported information to 
conﬁ rm the inclusion of all core safety, health 
and environmental performance indicators 
referenced in the IPIECA/API Guidance;

•  Reviewing the documented reporting 
requirements against the applicable industry 
guidelines to assure consistency of scope, 
deﬁ nition, and reporting for each of the 
relevant indicators;

•  Reviewing the reporting processes at 
Headquarters and at each of the functional 
business levels to evaluate the processes 
used by ExxonMobil to assure completeness, 
consistency, and conformance to reporting 
requirements across its global operations;

•  Reviewing the data-reporting processes 
at a sample of 11 operating sites to assess 
local understanding and implementa-
tion of reporting requirements. Sites 
selected were Antwerp Reﬁ nery, Belgium; 
Singapore Joint Site (reﬁ nery and chemical 
plant), Singapore; Upstream Production, 
Germany; Baton Rouge Plastics Plant, 
Louisiana; Pensacola Specialties 
Elastimers Plant, Florida; and lubricant 
facilities in Wakayama, Japan; Notre Dame 
de Gravenchon, France; Taichung, Taiwan; 
Serviburnu, Turkey; Tianjin, China; and 
Taicang, China; 

•  Reviewing the stakeholder engagement 
processes at Headquarters; and,

•  Reviewing the processes used to 
aggregate the data and information at the 
corporate level for inclusion in the Report.

safety, health, and environmental indica-
tors that are useful for assessing corporate 
performance and reporting information 
consistent with IPIECA/API Guidance. 

It should be noted that: 

•  Processes were in place to ensure that 
sites contributing to core safety, health, 
and environmental metrics understood 
corporate reporting obligations and were 
included in corporate safety, health, and 
environmental reporting;

•  Methods used for calculating each metric 
were deﬁ ned clearly and communicated;

•  Processes were in place to ensure that 
the quantitative indicators were checked for 
completeness, consistency, and accuracy;

•  Responsibility for annually reviewing and 
updating reporting guidelines was clear, 
with improvement in methodology regularly 
undertaken; 

•  Guidelines for GHG reporting were 
consistent with, and speciﬁ cally refer to, 
the API Compendium for GHG Emissions 
Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry 
(February 2004); and,

•  Active engagement with external 
stakeholders provided information for 
determining material issues.

LRQA’s Recommendations. Observations 
and areas for potential improvement 
were provided in a report to ExxonMobil 
Management. These observations do not 
affect our conclusions. 

Level of Assurance. The opinion expressed 
in this Assurance Statement has been 
formed on the basis of a reasonable level 
of assurance.

This document is subject to the provision below:

This Assurance Statement is only valid when published with the Report to which it refers.

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited, its afﬁ liates and subsidiaries and their respective ofﬁ cers, employees or agents are, individually and collectively, referred to in 
this clause as the “Lloyd’s Register Group.” The Lloyd’s Register Group assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense 
caused by reliance on the information or advice in this document or howsoever provided, unless that person has signed a contract with the relevant Lloyd’s Register 
Group entity for the provision of this information or advice, and in that case, any responsibility or liability is exclusively on the terms and conditions set out in that contract.

Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control, it is possible that fraud, error, or noncompliance with laws and regulations may occur and not be detected. 
Further, the veriﬁ cation was not designed to detect all weakness or errors in internal controls so far as they relate to the requirements set out above, as the veriﬁ cation 
has not been performed continuously throughout the period and the veriﬁ cation carried out on the relevant internal controls was on a test basis. Any projection of 
the evaluation of control to future periods is subject to the risk that the processes may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with them may deteriorate.
