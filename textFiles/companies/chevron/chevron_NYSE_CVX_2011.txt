How We Chose What to Include 
in Our Report

The Chevron Way 

We consult governments, 
communities, nongov-
ernmental organizations, 
academic institutions 
and others to help us 
identify emerging issues, 
develop our projects, 
and respond effectively 
to evolving challenges 
and expectations.

We welcome your com-
ments on the content in 
this report and on our 
website at Chevron.com/
CorporateResponsibility. 

Feedback can be sent to 
us at Chevron.com/
Contact/EmailChevron.

The Chevron Way defines 
who we are, what we 
do and what we believe. 
At the heart of The Chevron 
Way is our vision … to be 
the global energy company 
most admired for its 
people, partnership and 
performance.

We make this vision 
a reality by consistently 
putting our values into 
practice. The Chevron 
Way values distinguish us 
and guide our actions so 
that we get results the 
right way. Our values are 
integrity, trust, diversity, 
ingenuity, partnership, 
protecting people and the 
environment, and high 
performance.

To read more about The 
Chevron Way, please visit 
Chevron.com/ChevronWay.

In this report, we 
selected case studies 
that demonstrate 
our partnership and 
performance in geog-
raphies where we do 
business, as well as topics 
associated with our 
approach to responsible 
energy development — 
Operational Excellence, 
environmental steward-
ship, human rights, 
workforce development, 
health and safety, and 
social investment.

In an industry as complex 
as ours, we recognize 
that our ability to operate 
depends on how well we 
address the business, 
social and environmental 
expectations of our 
stakeholders.

A Message From Our CEO

Affordable energy is a cornerstone 
of human progress and economic 
prosperity. We create value for our 
shareholders by providing that 
energy safely and reliably.

Many of our business operations 
involve risk, which we work tirelessly 
to mitigate. We use processes and 
tools guided by our Chevron Way 
values and designed with one goal 
in mind: zero incidents. 

Over the past decade, our concerted 
efforts have helped us become an 
industry leader in safety. But, we’re 
not yet incident-free. We work to 
learn from our incidents and those 
of others so that we can reach and 
maintain our goal of zero incidents. 
That is my personal commitment. 
And I know that the men and women 
of Chevron join me in committing 
to our world-class standards in 
Operational Excellence. 

At the heart of our work is an 
ongoing focus on three areas critical 
to operating incident-free:

•  process safety — a system to help 
recognize and reduce risks, from 

the drawing board through daily 
operations;

•  environmental stewardship — our 

means of reducing our impact on our 
operating environments;

•  operational discipline — our approach 
to making certain that our employees 
and contractors perform every task 
the right way, every time.

Each falls under our Operational 
Excellence Management System, which 
guides how we manage risk through-
out the company. I encourage you to 
read more about our approach to 
Operational Excellence in this report.

Managing risk well helps us maximize 
the value of the investments we make 
to find and produce energy. These 
investments are significant. Our capital 
and exploratory budget in 2012 is 
$32.7 billion, which will be invested in 
energy projects that will produce 
for decades, generate tax revenue, 
help create local jobs and support 
local businesses. 

In addition to these direct economic 
benefits, we also make significant 
social investments in the communities 

John S. Watson
Chairman of the Board and 
Chief Executive Officer
May 2012

where we operate. We apply the 
same fundamental approach to our 
social investments that we apply 
to our capital investments. 

We work with our partners to identify 
and assess needs and to determine 
the scale and focus of investments. 
Our collaborative approach is rooted 
in business discipline and focused on 
outcomes. And our goal is to ensure 
that our social investments create 
measurable and enduring value, as 
they do in the case studies highlighted 
in this report.

Over the past six years, we’ve invested 
approximately $1 billion in areas 
essential to sustainable communities, 
including health, education and 
economic development.

It’s a matter of pride for us that 
our 57,000 employees strive to make 
Chevron the partner of choice by 
providing energy the right way and 
remaining a force for shared progress 
and prosperity.

Operational Excellence and 
Risk Management

We focus on protecting the safety and health 
of people and the environment and conducting our 
operations reliably and efficiently. The systematic 
management of process safety, personal safety, 
health, the environment, reliability and efficiency to 
achieve world-class performance is how we define 
Operational Excellence.

To achieve Operational Excellence (OE), we created an Operational Excellence 
Management System (OEMS) more than a decade ago. It’s part of our culture 
at all levels of our business. OEMS helps us identify, manage and reduce risk; 
improve performance; assure compliance; and sharpen our emergency response. 
It is a system that sets expectations for nearly everything we do operationally 
and goes beyond the scope of internationally recognized management systems 
for environmental as well as occupational health and safety (ISO 14001 and 
OHSAS 18001).

Our OEMS Tenets of Operation guide our workforce’s daily decisions and activities. 
These tenets are founded on two key principles: “Do it safely or not at all” and 
“There is always time to do it right.” For example, every person working at a 
Chevron facility has the authority and responsibility to stop work when witnessing 
any unsafe action or condition. Our goal is to have incident-free operations so 
that people remain safe and the environment is protected.

We strive to achieve Operational Excellence through our processes, standards 
and behavior with leadership action and the full involvement of our workforce. 
We are among the leaders in our industry in preventing incidents and injuries, 
as measured by the Total Recordable Incident Rate and the Days Away From Work 
Rate. Our OE platform provides us with a way to sustain high expectations and 
continual improvement. 

To learn more, please read our OEMS brochure at 
Chevron.com/OEMS.

Striving to Achieve Operational Excellence

On any given day, more than 250,000 employees and 
contractors from varying cultural and educational back-
grounds work on our projects and in our operations. 
Through disciplined implementation of our Operational 
Excellence Management System, our diverse work-
force applies OE processes, procedures and behaviors 
in our daily operations. On the following pages, employ-
ees in leadership positions share their insights about 
Chevron’s OEMS in action.

Reducing 
the Risk of 
Incidents

“   It’s been a seven-year journey to achieving zero 

incidents in Bangladesh — one that required 
a cultural ‘paradigm shift.’ We started with an 
environment that had low safety awareness. 
By establishing a strong leadership commitment 
to safety, significant oversight of contractors, 
continual training and effective implementation 
of standard processes — such as management 
of safe-work practices — we changed the safety 
culture. Now, we have accumulated more than 
31 million workforce hours without a Days Away 
From Work injury.”

   Kinnesh Dalal, Manager of Operational 

Excellence/Health, Environment and Safety, 
Chevron Bangladesh

“  We strive to reduce the risk of incidents by 

disciplined application of Chevron and industry 
process safety standards and best practices, 
with a particular focus on our Asset Integrity 
Management Program. In 2011, as part of this 
program, we verified the integrity of more than 
8,700 critical components of our facilities, includ-
ing key pressure vessels and piping. We use the 
Chevron Risk Management Process for regular 
reviews of all facilities and capital projects and for 
action planning to reduce health, environmental 
and safety risks across our operations.”

   Artur Custodio, Manager of Production 

Operations, Chevron Angola

Assuring 
Compliance

“   It’s our job in the OE audit group to verify 

that we have the right people, processes and 
equipment in place to mitigate risks at all levels 
of our operations — from major capital projects 
to daily maintenance programs. These audits 
are conducted at an established frequency and 
involve hundreds of interviews, data collection 
and checks that systems are in place to reduce 
risks. Chevron operates to the same standards 
around the globe, and we are always looking 
for ways to improve upon what we are doing to 
reach our goal of operating incident-free.”

   Jane Fruin, General Manager of the 

Corporate OE Audit Group

“  Members of my team go into the field to assess 
contractor knowledge and then provide immedi-
ate feedback. We collect data to help break the 
incident chain before incidents happen. We’ve 
conducted more than 14,000 safe-work-practice 
assessments over a two-year period, and this 
effort has helped us significantly reduce our Days 
Away From Work incidents.”

   Lane Blanchard, Contractor Management 

Advisor for Health, Environment and Safety, 
U.S. Gulf of Mexico

Improving
Performance

“ In 2011, we welcomed the Australian government’s 
environmental approval for our Wheatstone 
Project in Western Australia. Because we have 
had unwavering support for comprehensive 
terrestrial and marine assessment and under-
standing of habitats and species, we have been 
able to show that Chevron can manage the environ-
mental impacts and potential risks. Protecting 
the environment is a fundamental part of our 
Chevron Way values.”

   Andrew Mingst, Environmental Manager 

of the Wheatstone Project, Chevron Australia

“ Our ultimate goal is zero incidents, so it is 
important that we learn from the past and make 
improvements to prevent the same incident 
from being repeated. We conduct reviews of all 
incidents and major near misses throughout 
Chevron. We use a team of subject-matter 
experts to examine the root causes of the serious 
incidents and near misses in our annual Major 
Incident Study. This helps us look for common 
trends, determine where processes and pro-
cedures may need to be improved, and identify 
opportunities to strengthen our OE culture 
and leadership.”

   Todd Levy, Vice President of Chevron Upstream

Preparing for 
Emergency 
Response

“  Our first priority is to prevent emergencies, 
such as spills and releases, but we also need 
to be prepared to respond to them when they do 
occur. Our operating units develop site-specific 
emergency response and business-continuity 
plans that address and provide resources for all 
significant risks. We continually train our work-
force and conduct drills to improve readiness. 
Our tiered emergency response system includes 
local incident command teams supported 
by corporate and external resources, which we 
recently deployed in Brazil and Nigeria.”

   Jeff Patry, Manager of Emergency Response for 

Corporate Health, Environment and Safety

Response to 
Recent Incidents

In late 2011 and early 2012, Chevron 
faced two incidents. Extensive training 
and preparation helped the company 
respond quickly and effectively. In 
November 2011, during drilling opera-
tions at our Frade deepwater project 
in Brazil, hydrocarbons from the well-
bore reached the seafloor through 
seep lines. Our response significantly 
reduced the size of the sheen and 
stopped the source of the seep flow 
within only four days of first detection. 
As a result, no oil reached any shoreline.

In January 2012, a fire started aboard 
the shallow-water jack-up drilling 
rig KS Endeavor, which was drilling a 
natural gas exploration well off the 
coast of Nigeria. The quick implementa-
tion of emergency response procedures 
resulted in the safe evacuation of 152 
people in eight minutes. Tragically, 
however, the incident claimed two lives.

“  Incidents such as these are vivid reminders 
of the risks we face in our business. Our 
Chevron values place the highest priority 
on the health and safety of our workforce 
and the environment, and our culture of 
Operational Excellence challenges us daily 
to learn and improve from every experience 
and observation. We continue to strive 
for incident-free operations and sending 
our entire workforce home without injury.”

of Corporate Operational Excellence

Indonesia: 
Partnerships in 
Conservation and 
Preservation

We work to increase environmental awareness 
in our operations and in the community. 

Dayat Hidayat supports his three sons 
by growing chilis and long beans on a 
1-acre (0.4-ha) plot within Indonesia’s 
Mount Halimun Salak National Park, 
the largest rainforest on the island of 
Java, where farms, endangered species 
and Chevron’s expansive Salak geo-
thermal operations coexist. Our ability 
to work with the community to balance 
environmental stewardship, energy 
development and the community’s 
needs demonstrates how our partner-
ships help protect the environment 
and sustain livelihoods.

Indonesia faces constant challenges to 
produce more crops on limited arable 
land without encroaching further on 
forestland. In areas in and around 
Mount Halimun Salak National Park, 
timber was harvested to clear new 
land for farming and for wood for 
other businesses. In Hidayat’s village, 
three-quarters of the 2,000 residents 
are farmers. Hidayat and 107 farm-
ers like him are working with us and 
our partners on a community-based 
environmental conservation program 

to improve farming practices near the 
park and protect forests. We are also 
working with the farmers to preserve 
traditional techniques such as crop 
rotation and natural pest control, which 
are critical to sustaining crop produc-
tion rates.

For Hidayat, the conservation pro-
gram helps improve his business. 
“The farming training has widened 
my perspective and provided me 
with knowledge about environmental 
protection and better agricultural 
practices,” he said. “Understanding 
organic farming by using available 
resources in the environment is part 
of this work, like using sheep’s dung 
for fertilizer and learning good cattle-
breeding practices.” He said Chevron’s 
assistance in establishing farming 
cooperatives helps him pool resources 
and stabilize his income.

Business and the Environment
Our ability to operate safely in unique 
environments such as Mount Halimun 
Salak National Park demonstrates our 

commitment to environmental per-
formance and helps us expand our 
business in Indonesia. We understand 
that people, the natural environment 
and our operations are interdependent. 
In all our major capital projects, we 
integrate biodiversity into our business 
decisions by using the environmental 
stewardship component of our Opera-
tional Excellence Management System 
(OEMS). We work closely with govern-
ment agencies, nongovernmental 
organizations and community groups 
to manage our operational footprint 
in order to protect the unique environ-
ments where we are developing energy.

Mount Halimun Salak National Park is 
home to endangered species such as 
the Javan leopard, gibbon and hawk-
eagle. These animals are often spotted 
inside Chevron’s Salak geothermal 
operations areas. We partner with the 
national park and local, national and 
international wildlife groups to protect 
wildlife habitats and maintain nurseries 
to restore trees that were used to 
support local businesses. 

9

In our day-to-day operations, we 
follow strict policies to leave wildlife 
undisturbed, and we design pipelines 
to accommodate animal crossings. 
We collaborated with government 
authorities to minimize tree removal 
during pipe and well installation that 
was completed before the start of 
commercial operation in 1994. We also 
planted 3,000 trees inside our Salak 
operations area as part of a regreen-
ing effort.

Planting 

250,000

trees is a five-year 
goal of the Green 
Corridor Initiative

Commitment Beyond Compliance: 
Zero Water Discharge

Starting in 2011, Chevron 
engineers successfully 
implemented a zero-
water-discharge system 
at our Duri heavy oil fields 
in Sumatra. Every day, 
we produce approximately 
1 million barrels of water 
as part of our oil operations 
there. More than 80 percent 
of the produced water is 
used in enhanced oil recov-
ery operations, while 
the remainder is treated 
and put into government-
approved reservoirs 

that are approximately 
1,000 feet (305 m) below 
the ground. Injecting the 
water into reservoirs is 
a preferred practice that 
eliminates any impact 
on natural canal systems. 
We plan to expand this 
zero-water-discharge 
practice to other fields 
in Indonesia. 

“We are among the few 
oil and gas companies in 
Indonesia that implement 
a zero-discharge policy for 

excess produced water,” 
said Ferry Martin, Chevron 
general manager of Health, 
Environment and Safety 
in the region. “It’s a good 
example of teamwork with 
the government and our 
commitment to managing 
our environmental foot-
print. The government has 
asked us to share our best 
practices and applications 
with other companies. 
We’re proud to do that.”

Building a Conservation Ethic 
We have a long-term commitment 
to community-based environmental 
conservation programs in Indonesia. 
In 2002, we launched our partnership 
with the nonprofits Peduli Konservasi 
Alam Indonesia (PEKA Indonesia) 
and the Wildlife Trust to protect 
Salak Mountain’s ecosystem. PEKA’s 
work focused in part on environmental 
education and protection. At that 
time, PEKA reported that the illegal 
poaching and sale of several beetle 
species in and around our Salak 
geothermal area were destroying 
forests and threatening biodiversity 
and nearby communities’ agricultural 
water supply.

We continue to build upon conser-
vation programs in areas near our 
Salak operations, including the rural 
farming communities in Bogor and 
Sukabumi. Unemployment is high in 
those communities, where 60 percent 
of the population in the Salak area 
are women and youth. We partner 
with the nonprofit Yayasan Bina 
Usaha Lingkungan (YBUL) to educate 
farmers like Hidayat about rabbit 
and goat breeding as well as other 
alternatives that will not degrade 
forests or deplete the communities’ 

Above: At its Salak geothermal operations, Chevron has a nursery that germinates seedlings of native species to plant and maintain within 
the operations area. The company also collaborates with a nearby tea plantation to plant trees along the plantation’s access road.

“Chevron makes environmental protec-
tion and community their priority,” 
said Gita Gemilang of YBUL. “Shifting 
the community’s dependency from 
forest products to other sources of 
income generation that could become 
their alternative pillar of livelihood 
becomes crucial in this program. 
Chevron’s initiative is a path to sustain-
ability for farmers.”

In late 2011, we continued our support 
of conservation efforts by launching 
the Green Corridor Initiative, with 
a goal of planting 250,000 trees over 
five years. This effort helps restore 
the degraded forest that connects 
more than 1,200 acres (486 ha) of the 
ecological zone of the Mount Halimun 
Salak National Park forest corridor. 
The initiative involves more than 1,500 
people, the Mount Halimun Salak 
National Park, foundations, universities 
and local nongovernmental organiza-
tions. In December 2011, our employ-
ees, Mount Halimun Salak National 
Park representatives and community 
members planted the first 5,000 trees. 
This effort is part of a much larger 
one by the Indonesian government 
to rehabilitate the country’s damaged 
forests and replant barren lands.

In addition to our Green Corridor 
Initiative, in 2011 we worked with 
local schools, government agencies 
and nongovernmental agencies to 
plant 22,200 trees outside of the park 
but near our operations in Bogor 
and Sukabumi and in the Jayanegara 
tea plantation. 

In 2011, the Indonesian Ministry 
of Environment honored Chevron 
Geothermal Salak and Chevron 
Geothermal Indonesia with the 
PROPER Gold and Green awards, 
respectively. The PROPER award is 
regarded as the most prestigious 
award in environmental stewardship 
in Indonesia. 

Renewable 
Energy 

Investing in renewable 
energy and energy 
efficiency is one 
of Chevron’s business 
strategies.

We take a pragmatic approach 
to investments, focusing on three 
key areas that leverage our core 
competencies and existing assets: 
our geothermal business; the 
profitable, commercial-scale 
development of next-generation 
biofuels; and the development 
of energy efficiency solutions.

Geothermal power is the most 
significant segment of our renew-
able energy portfolio. We are the 
world’s largest geothermal power 
producer and have maintained 
operations in Indonesia and the 
Philippines for 30 and 40 years, 
respectively. Our geothermal 
operations generate more than 
1,250 megawatts of electricity per 
year — enough to meet the needs 
of 16 million people in these two 
countries. 

Through our technology ven-
tures business, we partner with 
others to increase our knowledge 
of biofuels and the technology 
needed to transform natural raw 
materials into profitable, high-
quality transportation fuels.

Colombia:
Working With
the Wayúu

12

For 35 years, Chevron has worked with Wayúu communities in Colombia, 
producing energy, strengthening the communities’ capabilities and 
respecting local customs. Our partnership blends our ethics of safety, 
environmental responsibility and shared progress with important 
values of the region’s Wayúu people: kindness, friendliness and respect.

Jaime Epinayu (foreground) and his family are one of 600 families who participate in a Chevron-
supported social investment program for ﬁ shermen in La Guajira in northern Colombia, 
where Chevron operates offshore and onshore natural gas ﬁ elds in Wayúu indigenous territory.

Paul Pinedo grew up in a clan among 
the indigenous Wayúu people of 
Colombia’s coast and clearly remem-
bers his first glimpse of an offshore 
drilling platform. “I was 10 years old 
and was fishing with my uncle. I asked 
him what it was, and he said, ‘a con-
struction from an alien civilization.’ 
For us, we had never seen a building 
with electricity in the middle of 
the sea,” Pinedo said.

Today, Pinedo is 27 and a Chevron 
engineer, and he understands fully 
how the platform functions. After 
high school, he was unsure how he 
would make a living, and talking 
to a friend helped him gain an interest 
in engineering. Upon completing his 
college engineering degree, Pinedo 
started with Chevron as an intern and 
was trained to work on the platform 
that he first saw with his uncle. He 
said he takes pride in bridging one of 
Colombia’s oldest cultures and the 
modern world of energy development.

Pinedo’s story is a small part of a much 
larger one of how Chevron partners 
with the Wayúu, the national oil com-
pany, the government and nongovern-
mental organizations to develop 
energy in La Guajira, a region between 
Colombia and Venezuela. Pinedo said 
most of those in his native Epinayu 
clan, which includes his 27 uncles and 
three brothers, are not interested in 
leaving their community. ”They prefer 
fishing and farming,” said Pinedo. 

The Wayúu live in La Guajira and own 
land near our coastal operations in 
northern Colombia. Our relationship 
with the Wayúu reflects the way 
Pinedo bridges his two worlds. We 
respect local traditions, protect the 
environment, address community 
needs and advance economic oppor-
tunities. Our strong partnerships help 
us responsibly expand our operations, 
resulting in benefits to our business 
and quality-of-life improvements for

the people of La Guajira and the rest 
of Colombia.

A Long History, a Shared Future
Chevron first stepped foot in Colombia 
in the late 1920s to explore for oil, 
but it wasn’t until the 1960s that we 
discovered both oil and natural gas. 
In partnership with Colombia’s national 
oil company, Ecopetrol, Chevron 
operates and develops the offshore 

Chuchupa gas field as well as the 
onshore Ballena and Riohacha gas 
fields in La Guajira. We have become 
Colombia’s largest producer of 
natural gas, supplying approximately 
4 million households. La Guajira 
supplies approximately 65 percent 
of the country’s natural gas. 

With natural gas reserves in decline in 
La Guajira, the national government 

partnered with Chevron in 2010 to 
explore for new natural gas resources 
along 233 miles (375 km) between the
La Guajira shoreline and deeper ocean.

“Because of our reputation for 
environmental responsibility and our 
longstanding relationship with the 
Wayúu, we were able to move forward 
with this important project,” said 
David Bantz, president of Chevron 
Colombia. “It’s critically important to 
us that our operations embody the 
respect we feel for the people and 
their land. Our efforts reflected that 
commitment.”

Before beginning our exploration work 
in 2010, we spent a year consulting 
with 172 Wayúu communities, each of 
which is considered an independent 
government entity. We invited Wayúu 
leaders to visit operations and talk 
about their culture and concerns. Our 
dialogue reaffirmed the foundation 
for a constructive relationship. 

“The spoken word is important for 
us, and Chevron approached our com-
munities like a neighbor who knocks 
on your door,” said Victor Manuel 
Epiayu, who grew up in a Wayúu clan 
and works for Chevron on community 
programs. “The Wayúu have a lot 
of respect for that great attitude.” 

Following our initial outreach, we imple-
mented our formal Environmental, 
Social and Health Impact Assessment 
(ESHIA) process to evaluate potential 
impacts on surrounding communities, 
natural resources, biodiversity, air qual-
ity, land use, waste management, noise 
and public health. The assessment was 
conducted in partnership with stake-
holders to make sure that we captured 
and addressed community concerns 
about reactivating natural gas fields 
and drilling new-development gas wells. 

From our discussions, we learned that 
we needed to change how we accessed 

Increasing Opportunities 
for Education

Support for education in 
the communities where we 
operate is important to us. 
In La Guajira, we trained 
teachers, who have helped 
more than 1,500 students 
improve their national 
test scores. 

Many Wayúu youth cannot 
go to school because they 
live too far away. Chevron 
helped finance the con-
struction of the Laachon 

Mayapo Ethno-Educational 
Center to serve communi-
ties in rural areas of the 
Manaure municipality. Now 
1,200 children can receive 
education and boarding. 
Also, the center provides 
girls with greater access to 
formal education. 

“Wayúu children are receiv-
ing top-level education both 
in Spanish and Wayúunaiki,” 
said Danis Cohen, an analyst 

for Chevron who is Wayúu. 
“It is an excellent alterna-
tive for families to be able 
to send their children to 
this school. At Laachon, 
children are experiencing 
the best Arijuna (Western) 
education while keeping 
their ancestral background 
and culture.”

Above: To support the education of Wayúu children who live far from schools, Chevron helped fund 
the construction and operation of education centers, such as the Laachon Mayapo Ethno-Educational 
Center, seen here.

our exploration site. To help ensure 
safety, trucks and other vehicles 
heading to Chevron facilities were 
diverted from Wayúu water reserves 
and traditional pathways to the ocean. 
Cables used in the process were 
positioned to avoid culturally sensi-
tive areas. Livestock were temporarily 
moved from our work locations, and 

dirt roads were watered down to 
limit truck dust so that children riding 
bikes to school were not affected. 
Our exploration team also worked with 
local fishermen to reduce the impact 
of our work on their livelihoods. 

We employed more than 360 local 
people, 60 percent of whom were 

15

municipalities of Riohacha and 
Manaure, benefiting 100,000 indig-
enous people. 

In the Mayapo rural area located in 
La Guajira, Wayúu communities are 
vulnerable to food shortages and 
have limited access to water, sanitation 
and health centers, in part because 
of the arid terrain. According to 
the 2010 Colombia Demographic and 
Health Survey, the rate of children 
facing malnutrition in La Guajira 
is 10 times higher than in the rest of 
the country. To address these needs, 
we built six health clinics in 2010 
and launched a pilot program in 2011 
that created 22 farms. By combining 
participation of professional farm 
specialists with the ancestral wisdom 
of the Wayúu, the project promotes 
the conservation of native species, the 
control of pests, the planting of trees 
for timber and the development of 
foliage to provide shade. 

The experimental farms have improved 
nutrition and income among partici-
pants. As a result, we are working with 
the local governments of the remaining 
150 Wayúu communities to implement 
similar programs. 

“Now we have options. We have food. 
Without the support of Chevron, we 
wouldn’t have this,” said Maria Luisa 
Ipuana, a Wayúu leader who benefited 
from the program.

Supporting a Way of Life
For Alberto Hernandez and his fellow 
Wayúu, fishing is a way of life. “Support 
by Chevron has been important for us 
and our families. Our fishing activities 
and our livelihoods are more developed 
and sustainable,” he said. 

The platforms we built off the coast, 
the first in 1973 and the second in 
1996, naturally became reefs where 
the Wayúu saw an opportunity to fish, 
but safety concerns prevented fishing

Wayúu, to assist with the ESHIA 
process. Then we added them 
to our exploration team to work on 
project support activities. The multi-
cultural team shared safety principles 
and practices with each other in 
Spanish; the local dialect, Wayúunaiki; 
and English.

The seismic and drilling gas project 
was completed in 2011 without injury 
or incident. According to the national 
oil company, Ecopetrol, and the 
Ministry of the Interior and Justice, 
our consultation with the commu-
nities and the social and environmental 
processes we implemented have 
the potential to be a model for other, 
similar projects in Colombia.

Partners in the Community
We continue to work with Wayúu 
communities to identify their areas of 
need: infrastructure improvements, 
educational and health programs, 
sustainable agriculture and fishing 
industries, and support for an emerg-
ing tourism industry.

“Chevron understands that meaning-
ful social projects are not short-term 
activities. They know it takes time 
and effort to achieve sustainable 
results,” said Gina Marcela Puentes of 
the Ecosfera Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization that works with the 
Wayúu on programs to improve their 
livelihood and preserve their culture. 
“I have seen other companies that 
don’t even bother to go to the ranche-
rias (Wayúu villages) to talk with the 
Wayúu authorities. Chevron gives 
the proper importance to each one of 
the communities and the people, and 
that really makes a difference.” 

To collaborate on finding new ways 
to improve the quality of life in La 
Guajira, Chevron became part of a 
29-member Regional Commission for 
Competitiveness composed of unions, 
nongovernmental organizations 
and other members of civil society. 
We partnered with the Ecosfera 
Foundation to drill and develop eight 
drinking-water wells and improve 
sanitation in rural areas of the 

Human Rights 

Our commitment to respecting 
human rights wherever we operate 
is grounded in The Chevron Way, 
which describes our vision and values.

We replaced our Human Rights 
Statement with a corporate 
policy in 2009 to foster greater 
awareness of human rights 
issues throughout the company 
and enhance our capabilities to 
manage them. Our Human Rights 
Policy covers four areas relevant 
to our business: employees, 
security providers, communities 
and suppliers. We began deploying 
the policy in 2010, with full imple-
mentation projected for 2013.

We formed an internal, cross-
functional, global team to guide 
implementation and enable en-
gagement from Human Resources; 
Global Security; Supply Chain 
Management; Policy, Government 
and Public Affairs; Law; and 
Health, Environment and Safety — 

all of which have responsibilities 
for meeting our human rights 
commitments.

The team conducted an exten-
sive review of Chevron’s existing 
policies and practices, and 
developed additional training and 
guidance to deepen the company’s 
collective understanding and 
capabilities. The Danish Institute 
for Human Rights provided 
external advice.

From 2010 to 2011, we conducted 
orientation sessions with select 
executives and staff. In 2012, 
we will focus on deploying the 
updated training and guidance to 
relevant parts of the business.

fishermen like Hernandez sustain 
their fishing and develop commercial 
markets, we created artificial reefs

such as global positioning systems, 
along with technical training and 
financial assistance, Chevron helped 
more than 640 fishermen in rural 
areas of the Manaure municipality in 
La Guajira.

We partner with the Wayúu to sup-

At the site of a reclaimed natural gas ﬁ eld in western Pennsylvania, 
a producing well leaves a small footprint.

As Chevron enters western Pennsylvania to develop natural gas from 
the Marcellus Shale, the company is striving to be the partner of 
choice, with a focus on safe and responsible development that promotes 
economic growth.

In Fayette County, Pennsylvania, 
Bill Jackson owns a dairy farm that his 
family founded in 1940. It’s not unusual 
for him to log 18-hour days tending 
to cattle and corn among the verdant 
rolling hills, rivers and forests typical of 
this rural area. A part of his farm is also 
leased for natural gas drilling.

“Natural gas is a resource that provides 
energy for the country. It’s every bit 
as much a part of the farm as the hay-
field or the cornfield that we see 
above the surface,” he said.

Western Pennsylvania residents like 
Jackson share a strong work ethic. 
But with the decline of the steel and 
coal industries over the past four 
decades, the region has suffered 
economically and has seen a popula-
tion decline.

In early 2011, Chevron acquired 
independent natural gas producer 
Atlas Energy, Inc., and began producing 
gas in southwestern Pennsylvania. 
Nearly all of the 366 employees who 
joined Chevron as a result of the 
acquisition continue to work with us 
today. With more than 700,000 acres 
(283,300 ha) under lease in the 
Marcellus Shale, Chevron is one of 
the state’s largest leaseholders. 

Adding to Economic Growth 
Marcellus natural gas can provide 
cleaner-burning, affordable energy, 
which supports energy security, 
regional jobs and economic growth 
for the United States and places like 
Fayette County. Chevron is helping 
ensure that the people of southwest-
ern Pennsylvania benefit from this 
resource without compromising their 
communities or the environment.

A 2011 study by global information 
company IHS estimated that by 2015, 
approximately 270,000 new jobs 
will be created in the Marcellus region, 
which could also support 1.6 million 
jobs by 2035.

Chevron drilled 60 wells in 2011 and 
will continue to expand operations 
in ways that benefit local economies 
while limiting negative impacts. 
According to Jackson, “The Marcellus 
industry has provided a much-needed 
boost to the economy. The hotels and 
restaurants are full. It has provided jobs 
for well operators, truck drivers, drillers 
and excavators — a wide array of jobs.”

Chevron’s Trip Oliver grew up in Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania, and understands 
the importance of this opportunity. 
“The development of Marcellus natural

gas has the potential to have the big-
gest impact on our region’s economy in 
my lifetime,” said Oliver, a government 
and public affairs manager for Chevron 
operations in the region. According to 
the Pennsylvania Department of Labor 
& Industry, from late 2009 to early 
2011, 72,000 people were hired in the 
core and ancillary Marcellus industries.

To encourage long-term job growth, we 
are partnering with Carnegie Science 
Center of Pittsburgh to launch the new 
Chevron Center for STEM Education 
and Career Development, which sup-
ports science, technology, engineering 
and math (STEM) for students from 
preschool to high school in the region.

“We need talented professionals — 
engineers, geologists, geophysicists 
and information technology special-
ists,” said Bruce Niemeyer, head of 
Chevron operations in the region. 
“This program will help enable the 
Pittsburgh area to remain competitive 
in a 21st-century global economy.”

Protecting People and the Environment
Pennsylvania’s history of oil and gas 
development dates back to 1859, when 

Colonel Edwin Drake developed the 
world’s first commercial oil well at 
a depth of 69 feet (21 m). The energy 
industry has long known about huge 
gas resources trapped in shale rock 
thousands of feet deep across the 
United States. But only in the past 
decade have energy companies com-
bined two established technologies — 
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal 
drilling — to successfully unlock this 
resource in the face of increased 
energy demand.

“Permission to operate depends on 
our ability to do business responsibly. 
Protecting land, water and commu-
nities is our highest priority,” said 
Niemeyer. “After the decline of this 
region’s coal mining and steel industries, 
people here worked hard to clean up the 
environment. Western Pennsylvanians 
don’t want to give that up.”

To foster dialogue between the com-
pany and local communities, we began 
work in 2011 to create an external advi-
sory council in Fayette County. The 
council was established in early 2012, 
and we have plans to create additional 
councils in other areas. We participate 
in informational meetings, display our 
exploration and production equipment 
at county fairs and other events, and 
offer media tours of well sites. Resi-
dents also can ask questions or express 
concerns through a community hotline.

After acquiring Atlas, Chevron moved 
quickly to share best safety and 
environmental practices with the new 
employees and contractors, using 
our Operational Excellence Manage-
ment System and underscoring our 
commitment to safe and responsible 
operations. “We acquired Atlas on a 
Friday, and by Saturday morning, we 
sent an internal team of experts to 
meet with key contractors to discuss 
safety and environmental stewardship,” 
said Niemeyer. “During our first full 
week, we hosted Chevron environ-

mental and safety professionals from 
other operations to share best prac-
tices and identify opportunities for 
improvement.” Chevron currently is 
working with regulators to strengthen 
regulations and with other energy 
producers to establish and enhance 
safety practices.

Native Pennsylvanian Bryan Hajos 
worked for Atlas for four years and is 
now a safe-work advisor for Chevron. 
Hajos trains contractors and former 
Atlas employees in Chevron’s safety 
culture and procedures. One of our 
many tools used to drive safety per-
formance is the five-step stop-work 
authority: Stop the unsafe or at-risk 
act, notify a supervisor, involve the 
right people in addressing the issue, 
resume work when the issue has been 
resolved and share what is learned.

“We used stop-work authority to halt 
a project to shore up a leased road, 
which delayed the project, but made 
the road safer,” said Hajos. “With 
stop-work authority, contractors and 
employees don’t need to explain lost 
productivity or time. New procedures, 
training and values are creating a 
positive experience where everyone 
is looking out for each other.”

Operating Responsibly
“It only takes 10 seconds to scare peo-
ple about the perceived risks of energy 
development, but it takes months or 
years to correct those misperceptions,” 
said Oliver. “It’s critical to communicate 
with southwestern Pennsylvanians 
about our proven approach to unlock-
ing natural gas from under their land.”

Producing gas from shale involves 
injecting water and special fluids into 
rock thousands of feet below the 
surface and the groundwater aquifers. 
A mixture of water and sand makes 
up more than 99 percent of the fluid, 
and chemical components are less 
than 1 percent. On FracFocus.org, a

Environment

We recognize the 
value of fresh water 
as a fundamental 
environmental and 
economic resource.

As users of this critical natural 
resource, we must manage 
water for the good of society,

includes improving our water-
use efficiency.

Chevron is committed to prevent-
ing groundwater contamination 
and spills, and meeting or surpass-
ing all regulatory and compliance 
requirements. 

To help enable the availability 
of safe and reliable freshwater 
resources, we developed an 
integrated corporatewide fresh-
water strategy that supports 
responsible water stewardship 
and management. This strategy 
begins with prevention and 
focuses on integrated practices 
that include well design and 
integrity, construction controls, 
water use, handling, recycling, 
and disposal.

wells are designed, drilled and installed 
to protect the groundwater during 
hydraulic fracturing and over the life 
of the well, which can be 30 to 50

are typically no deeper than 350 feet 
(107 m), while hydraulic fracturing 
operations take place at approximately 
7,500 feet (2,286 m) to 8,500 feet 
(2,591 m) below the surface. We con-
duct a series of tests over the life 
of the well to verify long-term integrity.

Our operations adhere to the com-
pany’s position statement on fresh 
water to safely and responsibly man-
age fracturing fluids, wastewater and 
produced water. We test all private 
wells used for drinking water within 

3,000 feet (914 m) of the proposed 
drilling location and provide test 
results to the owner of each well and 
to the Pennsylvania Department of 
Environmental Protection. To improve 
the industry’s transparency on water 
quality monitoring, the Marcellus 
Shale Coalition is developing a public 
database in which companies will 
post results.

Bill Jackson has the understanding 
that we hope others will gain as 
we inform them about our safety 
measures. “Agriculture is our liveli-
hood, and we wouldn’t do anything 
to endanger that livelihood, whether 
it’s the cows or the crops,” he said. 
“Our cows are fed off a spring, which 
was one of our early concerns. We’ve 
had it tested regularly, and nothing 
has changed.”

Chevron is also working to reduce truck 
traffic. A typical well needs approxi-
mately 1,200 truckloads of water for 
drilling and completions activities, 
which will increase truck trips over 
Pennsylvania’s rural roads. We are 
recycling water to reduce the number 
of trucks and emissions, and truck 
drivers are undergoing safety training. 
We also work with local officials to 
determine the best routes. 

“When we are finished at a well site, 
we leave the roads we used for access 
in the same condition as or better 
than when we arrived,” Oliver said. 

Many residents like Bryan Hajos hope 
Chevron can help reverse a decades-
long trend in Pennsylvania. “In the 
past 20 years, you’d go to college here 
and go somewhere else to find a job. 
Now people like my friends and me, 
who grew up here, have a chance to go 
to school here, stay in the community 
and work for a world-class organiza-
tion. Chevron is breathing new life into 
the community.” 

Executive Interview

Why is natural gas 
from shale important 
to Chevron and 
world energy supplies?

Natural gas from shale is dramatically 
changing the gas supply landscape 
in the United States — boosting 
reserves and providing a supply of 
safe, clean, affordable energy.

It is the fastest-growing source of 
natural gas in the United States and 
could become a major global energy 
source. Natural gas from shale 
has grown to about 25 percent of 
U.S. gas production in just a decade, 
and according to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration, it will be 
nearly 50 percent by 2035.

The development of this resource 
is creating thousands of jobs, 
improving energy security and 
lowering GHG emissions from 
electricity production.

Our U.S. investments have positioned 
us to become a leading developer 
of domestic shale gas. We also are 
exploring opportunities to develop 
natural gas from shale in Canada and 
central Europe.

Wes Lohec
Vice President for Health,
Environment and Safety

What challenges 
does Chevron face?

How is Chevron address-
ing these challenges?

Perhaps the biggest challenge is 
also our biggest opportunity — 
to improve community awareness 
and understanding about how 
we operate.

The discussion of natural gas from 
shale has been clouded by complex, 
conflicting and sometimes inaccurate 
information about the technologies 
we use. 

Every day we work to build trust with 
communities and other stakeholders, 
knowing that trust can come only
from operating safely and responsibly 
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Chevron may be new to the Marcellus 
Shale, but we have been using and 
advancing the foundation technologies 
for decades. From the day we acquired 
Atlas Energy, we have focused on 
applying our Operational Excellence 
Management System (OEMS) to our 
Marcellus operations.

This starts with our robust well design 
and drilling practices. We focus on 
water management, including working 
to recycle most of the water we use 
onsite. This reduces our freshwater 
consumption as well as our need 
for trucking and disposal. All of these 
practices aim to manage our environ-
mental footprint and the impact of our 
activities on the community.

Stakeholder and community engage-
ment is another core component 
of our OEMS. We are learning from local 
communities about their concerns and 
sharing information about our opera-
tions. In addition, we are committed to 
disclosing the chemical additives for 
all our new gas wells in the Marcellus 
Shale on the publicly available 
FracFocus (www.fracfocus.org) website.

South Africa: 
From Education to 
Employment

Our commitment to developing trade skills in the 
communities near our Cape Town, South Africa, refinery 
fosters social and economic opportunity.

For Thembakazi Sidumo, a welder-
in-training from the disadvantaged 
community of Du Noon in Cape 
Town, South Africa, the new skills 
she is learning provide a way to 
forge a new life.

“Now that I am going to get my weld-
ing certificate, I feel like I can walk 
through any door and I can do the 
job,” said Sidumo, a contractor whose 
optimism belies her residence amid the 
estimated 100,000 living in Du Noon, 
where illiteracy is common. “It is very 
challenging out there for a woman. 
But women can do it,” she said with a 
smile, “as well as men can do it.” 

The skills training programs that she 
and hundreds of other community 
members are participating in provide 
training for employment opportunities 
at refineries and other industries in 
the region. They are the result of a part-
nership between Chevron, government 

entities and local community-based 
organizations. With unemployment 
estimated at 25 percent in South Africa 
and 50 percent in Du Noon, these 
programs provide value to residents 
throughout the region and are building 
blocks for a better life. 

In 2011, Chevron South Africa cel-
ebrated milestones that encourage 
aspirations for the future. We marked 
100 years of operations in the coun-
try, the Caltex brand commemorated 
75 years and the Cape Town Refinery 
celebrated 45 years. During the past 
century, we have become a leading 
refiner and marketer of petroleum 
products in South Africa. We are one 
of the country’s top five petroleum 
brands, and nearly one-quarter of 
Chevron’s Caltex service stations are in 
the country. We have 1,000 employees 
in South Africa and have approximately 
440 employees at our Cape Town 
Refinery. We also hire contractors, like 

Sidumo, and many businesses that 
support refinery operations.

Our longevity in South Africa gives us 
an important stake in the community, 
as the nation’s journey of social, politi-
cal and economic change unfolds. 
Chevron was among the first support-
ers of the Sullivan Principles in 1977, 
which called for equal treatment of 
employees regardless of race. That 
year, 40 percent of our more than 700 
black workers were moved into refinery 
jobs traditionally held by whites. Today, 
more than 75 percent of our employees 
at the refinery are black.

“We recognize that our business 
success is linked to society’s progress,” 
said Steven Parker, general manager 
of Chevron’s Cape Town Refinery. 
“For South Africa to achieve high levels 
of economic growth and address 
the challenges of poverty and inequal-
ity, it is vital that we help advance

Responding to Change
The country is undergoing a historic 
transition to address the systematic 
exclusion of the majority of South 
Africans from full participation in the 
economy, particularly black South 
Africans, people with disabilities and 
women. The South African govern-
ment policy on these changes is called 
“transformation.”

“It’s important for all people in the 
community that companies like 
Chevron are doing the right thing 
when it comes to transformation. 
Everyone is aware that the whole 
nation is on a journey,” said Parker.

The South African government 
established the Broad-Based Black 
Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Act 
in an attempt to improve economic 
opportunities. Companies must provide 
their audited BBBEE score card rating 
when bidding for business, and the 
rating directly influences the award-
ing of contracts and trading licenses. 
The score card measures companies’ 
performance in key areas, including 
skills training, employment equity, 
enterprise development, preferential 
procurement, socioeconomic develop-
ment, ownership/shareholding and 
management.

The company was recognized for its 
commitment to transformation in 
the country. A 2011 independent BBBEE 
audit by Empowerdex found Chevron 
South Africa to be one of the lead-
ing companies redressing historical 
imbalances in the petroleum industry. 
Chevron South Africa places a strong 
emphasis on capacity building through 
proactive recruitment, development, 
coaching and internal promotion 
of people from diverse backgrounds.

Transforming Turnarounds
Chevron is focused on being the 
partner of choice in the community 
by actively participating in the 
development of the country. Our 
Cape Town Refinery supports the 
community skills training programs 
for refinery “turnarounds” as a 
way to reverse inequities brought 
on by the apartheid system.

A turnaround is a planned, periodic 
shutdown of a refinery to perform 
maintenance, test and replace 
materials, and repair equipment. 
Turnarounds occur periodically at 
the Cape Town Refinery. They take 
months to plan and up to two months 
to complete. They are necessary to 
maintain safety, improve efficiency 
and reliability, and sometimes expand 
capacity. This type of maintenance 
requires 1,000 to 2,000 qualified 
contractors, depending on the work 
needed. Understanding Chevron’s 
safety culture and processes is essen-
tial to the work and helps build upon 
the refinery’s safety record. In 2011, 
there were no Days Away From Work 
injuries during 4.25 million hours 
on the job.

Contractors working on turnarounds 
undergo Chevron’s comprehensive 
safety training, which includes safe-
work practices, hazard assessment, 
equipment training and many other 
elements. Contractors participate 
in our Fitness for Duty program, 
which confirms their ability to safely 
perform essential physical and 
cognitive requirements of the job 
without risk to themselves, others or 
the environment. And a safety “boot 
camp” is held for contractors on 
the day work begins.

Turnarounds are very visible to 
the local community. Many people 
approach Chevron asking for the 
opportunity to work, but very few 
have the basic skills necessary for 

such work. The World Economic 
Forum’s 2008–2009 Global 
Competitiveness Report cited an 
“inadequately educated workforce” 
as the primary problematic factor 
for doing business in South Africa.

To address this issue, the refinery’s 
Community Advisory Panel — a 
Chevron-initiated and supported 
monthly forum in which the company 
and community leaders share 
information, define needs and plan 
social investment projects — helped 
develop the skills training programs 
designed for refinery turnarounds. 
To implement the training programs, 
we collaborated with community 
leaders to form a partnership between 
the government, the Chevron refinery 
and local organizations. 

One program — a six-week appren-
ticeship course conducted by Empro 
Training Services Ltd., known as 
Emprotrain — was formed to assist 
in skills training for the oil, gas and 
chemical manufacturing industries. 
Students learn about safety principles 
and standards, rigging and piping, 
permitting, hand and power tools, and 
other aspects of turnaround work. 
Grants from Chevron and from the 
government’s Chemical Industries 
Education and Training Authority 
(CHIETA) support this program. In 
2011, 240 people participated. 

“Chevron is very receptive to 
addressing the poor work readiness 
of the many unemployed youth in 
the country,” said Roger Adriaanse, 
regional skills advisor at CHIETA. 
“They have opened their doors as a 
host employer for many young people 
leaving formal secondary and tertiary 
education and entering the labor 
market for the first time. The partner-
ship has addressed the continuing 
skills shortages in the artisanal, 
technical and professional fields that 

Above: Marilyn Jafta and other participants in the six-week-long Basic Trade Skills Program

are fundamental to the development 
and growth of the economy.”

Another partnership, with Northlink 
College, a nearby government-run 
college, provides a yearlong full-
time course to train fully qualified 
artisans. This program includes three 
months of training at the Chevron 
refinery. Participants become skilled 
electricians, welders, steel fabricators 
or mechanical fitters. In early 2012, 
23 graduates — including Sidumo, 
seven other women and 15 men — 
were hired by contractors to work on 
a Chevron refinery turnaround.

“The Northlink program provides 
young persons with an opportunity to 
learn skills that will enable them 

to find employment at the refinery 
during shutdowns and further apply for 
work in an engineering environment. 
Chevron wants to play an active part in 
alleviating the skills shortage in South 
Africa,” said Dion Miller, Northlink 
program manager.

“Chevron is a reputable organization 
in the industry, so the people who 
participate in the skills development 
initiatives become extremely market-
able and sought after once they exit 
the programs,” said Adriaanse. 
“Once gainfully employed, learners 
can provide for themselves without 
having to rely on others. They are now 
able to support their families, and 
their earnings are plowed back into the 
community in which they reside.”

Partnering With Higher Education

Chevron’s University 
Partnership Program 
(UPP) works with colleges 
and universities around 
the world to provide 
scholarships, grants and 
departmental support. 
UPP funds faculty posi-
tions, builds labs, and helps 
its partners attract and 
develop talented students 
and teachers. 

Our partnerships include 
an emphasis on engineer-
ing programs at schools 
such as the University of 
California, Davis (UC Davis), 
where Jim Davis, presi-
dent of Chevron Energy 
Solutions Co., serves on the 
board of the university’s 
Energy Efficiency Center. In 

addition to yearly support 
reaching up to $500,000, 
Chevron also provided 
a $2.5 million endowment 
for a permanent energy 
efficiency chair to run 
the center.

“Chevron has been a critical 
partner in helping UC Davis 
attract and retain more 
students in STEM fields,” 
said Enrique Lavernia, 
dean of UC Davis College of 
Engineering. “They provide 
internship and job oppor-
tunities for our graduates. 
Their staff make frequent 
visits to campus, partici-
pating in employment and 
professional development 
opportunities, helping our 
students recognize the 

real-world potential 
of their academic work.” 

In the past five years, 
Chevron has hired 500 
full-time employees 
and another 500 interns 
from California universities. 
Eighty percent of those 
hires were in the fields 
of science, technology, 
engineering and math — 
the STEM subjects. For 
us, supporting STEM 
is a business imperative.

Below: UC Davis doctoral can-
didate Tarit Nimmanwudipong

sis research laboratory. 
The equipment is partially 
funded by Chevron. 

Headquartered in California, Chevron 
is the state’s largest company and 
a critical driver of its economy. In 
California, we employ approximately 
10,000 people full time. For every 
job we create, nearly six more jobs 
result, either directly related to the 
energy business or in other services. 

We understand that the most impor-
tant source of energy here is our 
people. Few factors are more critical 
to California’s — and Chevron’s — 
ability to compete in the global econ-
omy than nurturing talent in STEM. 
We recognize that education is 
a basic building block that contributes 

Above, top: During Chevron Engineering 
Camp in Bakersfield, California, students

to measure specific laws of physics, such as 
trajectory and velocity. 
Bottom: Co–presenting sponsors Chevron and

Engineering Camp, the Fruitvale Junior 
High School student from Kern 
County, California, thrust his arms

“It went really good, better than I had 
expected,” he said with a smile. “At first 
the parachute wasn’t going to come 
out, but right at the last second, it 
came out and floated down really fast.” 

The rocket launch was the culmina-
tion of a weeklong program involving 
local teachers and Chevron volunteers 
to generate excitement among young 
people about science, technology, 
engineering and math — collectively 
referred to as STEM. It is one example 
of how our investments in California’s 
future are producing results.

to economic development and sus-
tained prosperity. 

“The most important challenge for 
California’s economy over the long 
term is making sure we create our 
own indigenous STEM human capital 
inside the state,” said Ross DeVol, chief 
economist with the Milken Institute, a 
California-based economic think tank. 
“That’s why programs like the ones 
Chevron funds are critically important.”

The need to invest in STEM education 
is growing across the United States. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
projects that 15 of the 20 fastest-
growing occupations in 2014 will 
require science or math knowledge. 
California matches that statistic for 
the 50 fastest-growing occupations. 
At the same time, the state ranks below 
the national average in per-student 
spending, has the highest number of 
students per teacher, and placed 47th 
out of 50 states in math scores among 
eighth-grade students.

In the United States, Chevron invested 
nearly $100 million in education 
over the past three years alone. In 
California, more than half a million 
students and 6,600 teachers benefited 
from Chevron-funded STEM education 
programs in the past two years, 
including professional development 
programs for nearly 1,000 teachers. 
Our support also helped nonprofits 
introduce new STEM curriculum 
and hundreds of new STEM activities 
and programs into California’s public 
schools, and provided some 13,000 new 
STEM resources for students, including 
scholarships, science and robotics 
kits, computers, and lab equipment.

“We’re working to cultivate the 
next generation of mathematicians, 
scientists and innovators by forming 
partnerships, harnessing the power of 
human capital and implementing 
new approaches,” said Linda Padon, 

Social Investment 

Across our operations, we work with our 
stakeholders, building long-term partnerships 
that foster economic development and 
lasting benefits to communities. 

   The three main focus areas of our 
social investments are education, 
health and economic development. 
All three are key to improving the 
quality of life. The following are 
a few examples.

•  Chevron’s Energy for Learning 

program has reached the 
educational lives of thousands 
of children and adults world-
wide. We support education and 
training programs in China, 
Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, 
the Philippines, Singapore, 
South Africa, Thailand, the United 
Kingdom and the United States.

•  In the area of health, Chevron 

has pledged $20 million over five 
years to a global plan to eliminate 
mother-to-child transmission of 
HIV, taking our commitment to 
the fight against HIV/AIDS and our 
partnership with the Global Fund 
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria to a new level. We support 
awareness, prevention, testing and 
treatment programs in Angola, 
Indonesia, Nigeria, the Philippines, 
South Africa and Thailand.

•  In 2011, we initiated a five-year 
social investment program 
to support the people of Liberia.

The Chevron-Liberia Economic 
Development Initiative is designed 
to deliver sustainable benefits 
to women, children and youth 
through education, enterprise 
development and health. By 
year-end, we had helped fund 36 
projects in hospitals, vocational 
training centers, schools and 
communities.

Supporting Nonprofit 
Organizations
In 2009, we created the California 
Partnership, an ongoing initiative 
to invest in economic development 
and STEM education, with a focus on 
underserved communities where we 
have operations across our home state. 
Nonprofit organizations and multiple 
public school districts across California 
benefit. Organizations that are selected 
to participate have demonstrated 
innovative approaches with proven 
track records for delivering economic 
and educational benefits to those 
in need.

One of the organizations we support 
within California and other U.S. states 
is Project Lead The Way, a national 
provider of rigorous STEM education 
for middle school and high school 
students. In California, the Project 
Lead The Way program has grown by 
about 35 percent in each of the past 
three years and now serves more than 
30,000 students in 276 schools and 
115 school districts. 

“Ninety percent of students with 
experience in Project Lead The Way 
who enter a four-year engineering 
program graduate, whereas that 
rate is 50 percent for those who do 
not,” said Project Lead The Way’s 
Bruce Westermo. “Our partnership 
with Chevron works to increase 
the number and quality of engineers 
and technologists.” 

Chevron supports Project Lead The 
Way in regions near company facilities 
in Bakersfield, El Segundo, Sacra-
mento, Richmond and other parts of 
California. We invested in an expansion 
of Project Lead The Way curriculum 
from one school to eight schools near 
our Bakersfield facility in Kern County, 
benefiting nearly 700 students.

jobs will need to be 
filled by 2018

At the heart of our efforts in California 
is a focus on multisector partnerships to 
improve STEM education. Chevron pro-
vides funding for the Young Innovators 
Club in Kern County. The after-school 
program is a collaboration between 
Taft College and Lincoln Junior High 
School that reinforces STEM concepts 
students learn in Project Lead The 
Way classes. Students use computer 
software for 3-D modeling; build robots 
and airplanes; and learn about energy, 
the environment and physics. Teachers 
at Lincoln have access to extra class-
room resources thanks to Chevron’s 
statewide partnership with the online 
nonprofit DonorsChoose.org.

Inspiring Students Through 
Hands-on Experience
In Richmond, California, our California 
Partnership has brought new hands-
on learning opportunities to students. 
Richmond High School used Chevron 
funding to introduce Project Lead The 
Way curriculum to their Engineering 
Academy. The city of Richmond, the 
West Contra Costa Unified School 
District and Chevron also collaborated 
to fund and install a computer lab at 
the school to support Project Lead 
The Way activities.

Bruce Harter, the West Contra Costa 
superintendent of schools, noted, 
“This computer lab is a great exam-
ple of how the public and private 
sectors can work and cooperate with 
each other to have a huge impact 
on people’s lives. It will feed a real 
hunger among many of our students 
for advanced classes and training.”

We also invest in Richmond High 
School’s after-school robotics program. 
Students in the program participate 
in national competitions. At the 2011 
Bay Area Science Festival, the students 
showcased Chompy the Robot to more 
than 15,000 visitors at the Chevron 
Exploration Village.

Beyond Chevron’s financial investments 
in education, the company matches 
employees’ contributions to nonprofits, 
and employees volunteer to help 
students through Chevron Humankind, 
our U.S. employee and retiree giving 
and volunteer program. 

Chevron automation engineer 
Brandon Carey volunteers on STEM 
programs in Bakersfield. “I’m excited 
to get engaged with the younger 
students and get those individuals to 
see how fun it is to be involved in 
this type of work. Early engagement 
helps prepare them to be of great 
value to the community.” 

Executive Interview

What human 
resource challenges 
does Chevron face?

One of our challenges is getting 
people with the right skills in the right 
place at the right time. 

The people who design and run 
the engineering marvels that bring us 
energy have one thing in common — 
they’re strong in science, technology, 
engineering and math (STEM) skills. 
So it’s a business imperative that 
we’re dedicated to creating a pipeline 
for hiring and nurturing people with 
such talent.

Over the past five years, we’ve hired 
an average of 5,000 people a year, 
most of whom have been hired outside 
the United States. Once they’re on 
board, we continue developing their 
experience and technical skills.

But our need for human capital requires 
us to look beyond our company and 
to our communities. Wherever we 
operate, we actively focus on the kind 
of education — the STEM subjects — 
that most directly leads to the highly 
skilled workers who help our business 
grow and prosper.

Joe Laymon
Vice President for Human Resources, 
Medical and Security

What will help meet 
this challenge?

How is Chevron address-
ing this challenge?

Recent studies highlight that 
the success of STEM education will 
determine whether a country will 
have the needed technical capacity 
to meet challenges in areas such 
as energy, health, environmental pro-
tection and national security.

A healthy STEM education pipeline 
spanning preschool through higher 
education is critical to producing 
a workforce that can compete in the 
global marketplace. It will train the 
future scientists, engineers, mathe-
maticians and innovators needed 
to develop ideas and products, and 
help improve economic standing. 

These STEM workers will continue 
to be a vital part of all countries’ 
economies. 

We believe three things are critical to 
advance STEM education.

First, we must work together through 
collaborative partnerships, such as 
our partnership with Project Lead The 
Way, which encourages the develop-
ment of problem-solving skills, critical 
thinking, and creative reasoning 
through a rigorous STEM curriculum 
in middle and high schools.

Second, we believe in the power of 
human capital. In our partnership 
with Techbridge, a U.S. nonprofit that 
encourages young women to study 
science and engineering, Chevron 
employees serve as role models. 
We also help provide after-school and 
summer science curriculum. 

Third, we believe in coordinated, inte-
grated approaches. Chevron works 
across sectors — with nonprofits, 
governmental organizations, univer-
sities and regional forums — to increase 
STEM education opportunities 
for young people. We recognize that 
students, parents, businesses and 
government all have roles to play.

Nigeria: 
Transformative 
Investments

Multistakeholder partnerships are at the heart of our innovative, 
socioeconomic investment models in the Niger Delta.

Nigeria’s complex socioeconomic 
challenges are as diverse as its coastal 
plains, tropical forests and rugged 
highlands. Chevron has been operat-
ing in Africa’s most populous country 
for 50 years. During this time, we have 
forged successful partnerships and 
given support to address the problems 
of social instability, poverty and disease 
that have gripped the Niger Delta 
region, where we conduct the bulk of 
our operations in the country. 

One of our longstanding social invest-
ments in the Niger Delta is our Global 
Memorandum of Understanding 
(GMOU) program with local communi-
ties. The GMOUs were initiated in 
2005 to give communities greater 
roles in the management of their own 
development through the collective 
setting of priorities, identification of 
employment and contracting opportu-
nities, and management of conflict. 

Since their inception, the GMOUs 
we signed with eight Regional 
Development Committees (RDCs) 
in the Niger Delta have delivered 

more than 200 projects in 425 
communities, villages and chiefdoms, 
and have benefited some 850,000 
people. Partnering with local non-
governmental organizations has 
been essential in providing technical 
assistance and helping resolve conflicts 
in the communities. Through these 
participatory partnerships, Chevron 
has sponsored workshops on financial 
management, government budgeting, 
lobbying processes and commu-
nity relations to improve the RDCs’ 
effectiveness. 

Raphael Nomiye, a leader of the Ilaje 
RDC, in a coastal area where many 
energy companies operate, said the 
GMOU process helped community lead-
ers complete 30 projects in 2011, which 
was “in line with our cardinal objective 
to stimulate sustainable develop-
ment in the Ilaje land.” He pointed to 
microcredit lending as key for local 
business opportunities. “Many of those 
who could not meet the requirements 
for loans from commercial banks have 
benefited to improve their business or 
start up new ones,” he said. The RDCs 

have provided loans to 2,000 individu-
als in the Niger Delta region.

Along Nigeria’s southwestern coast, 
our Escravos Gas-to-Liquids (EGTL) 
plant under construction is designed 
to produce cleaner-burning diesel 
fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and naph-
tha from natural gas. With a high rate 
of unemployment in the Delta, the 
EGTL project provides an opportunity 
for economic progress and job growth. 

“We approached our GMOU communi-
ties to seek capable local suppliers 
and provide training,” said Mick Kraly, 
EGTL project manager. “I’ve seen huge 
changes in confidence and capabilities in 
these companies, some of which went 
from a few employees to hundreds.”

To date, more than 10,000 Nigerians, 
mostly from the Delta, have jobs at 
EGTL and were trained in international 
safety standards. More than 1,500 
purchase orders have been placed with 
Nigerian vendors, and 500 contract 
companies are involved in EGTL. One of 
those companies is Biloritz Nigeria Ltd.,

Two foundations were created to 
support this goal. The NDPI Foundation 
was established in the United States 
to coordinate development-project 
funding, while the Foundation for 
Partnership Initiatives in the Niger 
Delta (PIND) is in Nigeria and actively 
engages in the design, development 
and monitoring of the programs funded 
by the NDPI and other donor partners. 

According to Bill Grant, an economic 
development specialist with Devel-
opment Alternatives Inc., the NDPI’s 
efforts recognize that there cannot 
be meaningful change in the Niger 
Delta without the creation of a more 
enabling and peaceful environment 
for economic growth.

“These socioeconomic challenges 
are complex,” said Grant, “and 
require an understanding of how all 
the elements fit together. NDPI 
uses market-development thinking 
as its underlying strategy to drive 
economic growth. This is all supported 
by analyzing what is — and is not — 
working and building advocacy to drive 
the changes. By building a constitu-
ency of local partners interested in 
the same objectives, the approach 
is pragmatic and generates ownership 
and a common understanding of the 
challenges and the solutions.”

and friends provided initial startup capital, and PIND provided a water well and storage tank. Now the 
youths support themselves through their business.

Learning From the Angola 
Partnership Initiative

The NDPI/PIND model has 
roots of success in Angola. 
To help rebuild Angola after 
years of civil war, Chevron’s 
pioneering work on the 
Angola Partnership Initiative 
began in 2002 in collabora-
tion with international 
aid agencies, such as USAID 
and the United Nations 
Development Programme. 

The Angola Partnership 
Initiative focused on 
development programs 
that sought stability 
and growth in the areas 
most affected by conflict, 
rather than on Chevron’s 
business interests and 
operational areas. Together 
with our partners, we gen-
erated innovative results. 

For example, we helped fund 
the establishment of Angola’s 
first microfinance bank and 
subsidized improvements 
in commercial agriculture, 
such as a vegetable coop-
erative that grew into a 
sustainable enterprise that 
needed no subsidies.

a piping and engineering company 
that went from 46 employees in 2009 
to 224 today. 

“It takes a lot of work to build these 
relationships,” said Kraly, “but once 
you get there, it’s very special. The 
GMOU process builds hope, peace and 
a sustainable way of doing things.”

NDPI: Moving Beyond Our Operations
Building on our foundation of participa-
tory partnerships in Nigeria, in 2010 we 
launched the Niger Delta Partnership 
Initiative (NDPI) and announced our 
five-year, $50 million endowment.

The NDPI involves a multisector com-
mitment with local and international 
partners. It broadens our involvement 
because it addresses regional eco-
nomic development outside our areas 
of operation. 

The NDPI quickly generated interest 
among the international donor com-
munity. In February 2011, the U.S. 
Agency for International Development 
(USAID) committed $25 million to jointly 
support a number of NDPI projects. 

“The approach is unique in that it not 
only addresses social and economic 
problems in the Niger Delta but also 
analyzes them to understand their 
root causes and identify sustainable 
solutions,” said Chevron’s Dennis 
Flemming, who has worked for 25 
years on socioeconomic development 
programs in developing countries.

“The United States government, 
through USAID, is committed to work-
ing with the private sector in Nigeria to 
establish innovative and dynamic part-
nerships to promote socioeconomic 
development in the Niger Delta region, 
foster peace and stability, and improve 
the quality of life for residents,” said 
Ray Kirkland, USAID’s former mission 

36

Diversity

The richness of our 
cultural diversity 
enhances our work 
environment.

Chevron operates in many 
countries, with different cultures 
and people. Having a workforce 
that is rich in diversity is essential.

We have made considerable 
progress in nationalizing 
our overall workforce. More than 
90 percent of our workforce 
comprises nationals working in 
their home countries. We also 
track our progress in increasing 
the diversity of our senior-level 
leaders. In 2011, women and 
non-Caucasian men accounted for 
27.5 percent of senior executives. 

To support our values of diversity 
and inclusion, approximately 
25,000 Chevron employees are 
members of employee networks — 
defined by gender, race, national 
origin, age, disability or sexual 
orientation — that foster communi-
cation among employees and 
cultivate links with communities.

We strive to expand relationships 
with minority and women suppliers. 
In 2011, we spent $833.4 million 
with women- and minority-owned 
businesses in the United States. 
We spent more than $2.1 billion on 
goods and services from U.S.-
based small businesses.

director for Nigeria, during the signing 
of the agreement between the NDPI 
and USAID.

In 2011, the NDPI, along with the 
United Kingdom’s Department 
for International Development and 
the German International Cooperation 
Agency (GIZ), analyzed potential 
high-growth commodities in the 
Delta, resulting in the identification 
of cassava, palm oil and farm-raised 
catfish as sectors having strong 
development potential. Analysis of 
the commodity value chains identified 
opportunities to address constraints 
on market development within those 
sectors. Initial pilot interventions 
are focusing on fish-farming associa-
tions and cooperatives operating from 
a cluster of more than 3,600 ponds 
in Ekpan, Delta State.

The NDPI intends to expand its 
network of organizations, businesses 
and consultants promoting eco-
nomic development in the Niger 
Delta. PIND has awarded more than 
$350,000 in small grants to local civil-
society organizations and partnered 
with GIZ to train 42 individuals from 
Edo and Delta States as trainers in 
enterprise formation. 

Professor Obafemi Ajibola is a member 
of the PIND board of trustees and 
CEO of the New Nigeria Foundation, 
a nonprofit organization that encour-
ages sustainable development. 
He believes the NDPI approach can 
succeed “because it identifies and 
deals with the systemic constraints 
faced by many economically active 
poor persons, thus encouraging 
creative market solutions.” 

Progress Update

In 2011, we reached milestones in 
many of our operations and 
communities. Following are a few 
examples from regions covered 
in our previous reports. 

In September 2011, students of the first graduating class at Politeknik Aceh celebrated. 
The polytechnic university awards degrees in applied engineering and technology fields. 
From left are graduates Cut Fitri Saumi, Al Mukhyar and Uci Zulfira Rahayu.

Indonesia

Politeknik Aceh graduated its first 
140 students in September 2011. 
The polytechnic university was built 
by Chevron and its partners as part of 
the Chevron Aceh Recovery Initiative 
that followed the 2004 tsunami. 
Currently, 540 students are learning 
about mechatronics, industrial elec-
tronics engineering, accounting and 
other subjects that support long-term 
economic growth in Aceh.

In line with our commitment to support 
the education of Indonesia’s youth, 
we designed the Chevron Earthquake 
Recovery Initiative in 2009 to rebuild 
educational facilities destroyed by the 
earthquakes. With $1.8 million from 
employee donations and company 
funds, Chevron worked with the cen-
tral government, local governments, 
nongovernmental organizations, civil 
society and school committees to 
restore and rebuild two schools in West 
Sumatra and another two schools in 
Sukabumi and Garut regencies, where 
Chevron has its Darajat and Salak geo-
thermal operations. The buildings were 
designed to resist earthquakes, and 
the Padang Vocational High School can 
function as shelter for 2,200 people in 
case of a tsunami.

Australia

We’re setting a new benchmark in 
the management of biosecurity risks 
through our quarantine management 
system on Barrow Island, home of the 
Gorgon liquefied natural gas project. 
Effective quarantine management 
is at the core of our commitment to 
safeguarding Barrow Island’s unique 
species. The Western Australian 
Environmental Protection Authority 
has acknowledged that our system is
likely to be the world’s best practice. 
The system was developed with 
help from independent experts and 
applies innovative engineering 
solutions to ecological challenges.

We are also playing an important role 
in the large-scale demonstration of 
greenhouse gas storage technology 
through our Gorgon CO2-injection 
project, an investment of approxi-
mately $2.1 billion. We plan to separate 
CO2, which occurs naturally in the 
Gorgon produced gas, and inject 
it into a deep containment reservoir 
1.6 miles (2.6 km) beneath Barrow 
Island. The project has received sup-
port from many sectors and groups, 
including recognition from the interna-
tional Carbon Sequestration Leader-
ship Forum. The Australian government 
has also committed approximately 
$62.7 million to the Gorgon Project as 
part of the Low Emissions Technology 
Demonstration Fund.

U.S. Gulf of Mexico

The drilling activity that had begun 
in March 2010 at the Moccasin 
prospect in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico 
was stopped that June, when the U.S. 
government imposed a moratorium 
on deepwater drilling in the Gulf. 
In March 2011, we were issued a 
deepwater permit by the U.S. Bureau 
of Ocean Energy Management, Reg-
ulation and Enforcement to resume 
drilling the Moccasin exploration 
well. In September, we announced a 
new oil discovery at the prospect.

Since the BP Macondo well incident, 
we have reviewed our processes, 
procedures and well-control contin-
gency plans at our drilling operations 
worldwide to confirm our ability to 
operate safely and respond to any 
unforeseen incidents. Chevron is 
one of the sponsor companies of the 
Marine Well Containment Co. (MWCC), 
a nonprofit, independent organiza-
tion committed to improving response 
capabilities for containing deepwater 
well-control incidents in the U.S. Gulf of 
Mexico. MWCC developed an interim oil-
spill containment system that became 
available for use in February 2011. 

Kazakhstan

As Kazakhstan celebrated its 20th 
anniversary of independence in 2011, 
Chevron continued to support new 
initiatives in the country. In addition to 
helping develop innovative projects 
in vocational training and earthquake 
preparedness for Almaty citizens, 
Chevron signed a partnership agree-
ment with Nazarbayev University in 
the country’s capital city, Astana, to 
provide funds to the Center for Energy 
Research for studies in energy, the 
environment and sustainable develop-
ment, and to provide the Social 
Development Fund to support young 
researchers. Since its operations 
began in 1993, the Chevron-led joint-
venture Tengizchevroil has invested 
$700 million to fund social programs in 
the Atyrau region for its workforce 
and the community.

Angola

In 2011, we partnered with the Baylor 
College of Medicine, Texas Children’s 
Hospital and the Republic of Angola on 
two health initiatives. Chevron has 
committed $4 million over four years 
to support the Angola Sickle Cell 
Initiative, the country’s first compre-
hensive sickle cell treatment program. 
Of the more than 6,000 babies who 
were screened in 2011, 85 were identi-
fied as having the disease and will 
receive treatment before they manifest 
symptoms. We also announced 
a $6 million, five-year agreement to 
expand Texas Children’s Hospital’s 
Global Health Corps program, which 
provides lifesaving pediatric health 
care and treatment to medically 
underserved populations in Angola 
and Liberia.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

At Chevron, we are taking significant steps to address 
greenhouse gases (GHGs). The use of fossil fuels to meet 
the world’s energy needs contributes to an increase 
in GHGs — mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane — 
in Earth’s atmosphere. We made a long-term commitment 
to improve energy efficiency in our day-to-day activities, 
which will help us manage our carbon emissions. We 
inventory our emissions and use innovative technologies 
to continually improve the efficiency of energy use 
in our operations. We also assess GHG emissions in our 
capital projects.

For the sixth time since 2004, the Carbon Disclosure 
Project has featured us in their Leadership Index as 
an industry leader in disclosing GHG emissions manage-
ment information. A score of 86 reflects our good, 
transparent data management and understanding of 
GHG management issues.

In 2011, emissions were 59.8 million metric tons of CO2 
equivalent, meeting our goal of 60.0 million tons.

Our emissions goal for 2012 is 60.5 million metric tons 
of CO2 equivalent. Normal production levels and emis-
sions are expected to resume in areas where disruptions 
and maintenance occurred in 2011, and emissions are 
expected from new facilities and facility expansions 
coming online in 2012. We will seek emissions reductions 
through energy efficiency improvements and reduced 
flaring and venting.

Combustion of our products resulted in emissions of 
approximately 396 million metric tons of CO2 in 2011, approxi-
mately 5 percent less than the 418 million metric tons 
emitted in 2010. More details on flaring reduction and prod-
ucts combustion are provided in footnote 1 on page 45.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity

Our 2011 GHG emissions intensity was 34.9 metric tons of 
CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels of Upstream operations 
net oil-equivalent production, up from 32.9 metric tons 
in 2010. Our Downstream intensity was 36.8 metric tons of 
CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels crude oil refinery feed, 
up from 35.4 in 2010.

Air Emissions

are due to changes in sour gas production from a 
maturing Saudi Arabia/Partitioned Zone (SA/PZ) reser-
voir, and improved estimates of gas production and 
SA/PZ flare gas.

2011 nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions are lower than in 
2010 due to the divestment of the Pembroke Refinery and 
a revised Hawaii Refinery estimate from source testing.

Oil Discharges to Water

In 2011, Chevron discharged 1,574 metric tons of oil to 
surface water, 31 percent less than in 2010. The chart on 
page 42 shows reduced oil concentration in water 
discharges for Upstream and Gas and for Manufacturing 
and Chemicals. The Upstream and Gas average oil 
concentration in discharges to water decreased in 2011 
mainly due to improvements in Sumatra. The Manufac-
turing and Chemicals average oil concentration in 
discharges to water decreased due to the divestment 
of the Pembroke Refinery, improved El Segundo Refinery 
effluent-treatment system performance, and seasonal 
rainfall variation.

Hazardous Waste

The 2011 hazardous waste generated was 1.01 million 
metric tons, a decrease from the 1.10 million metric 
tons reported for 2010. This reduction is attributed to 
Manufacturing, where generation decreased due to 
decreased disposal of contaminated refinery soil, report-
ing changes to align with regulatory requirements, 
and the divestment of the Pembroke Refinery. The 
2011 hazardous waste disposed of was 520,733 metric 
tons. The 2011 amount that was recycled, reused and 
recovered was 509,097 metric tons.

Petroleum Spills 

We continually review and improve systems to prevent 
spills. In 2011, 274 petroleum spills released 12,401 barrels, 
a slight increase compared with 12,114 barrels released 
by 258 spills in 2010. Approximately 18 percent, or 
2,236 barrels, of the total volume was spilled to secondary 
containment in 2011. Compared with 2005, there were 
40 percent fewer spills, and spill volume was reduced by 
70 percent.

2011 volatile organic compound (VOC) air emissions are 
estimated at similar levels to previous years.

2011 sulfur oxides (SOX) emissions are at similar levels to 
2010 and 2009. Changes in SOX emissions over the years 

Fines and Settlements9

2011 environmental fines and settlements were $89.4 mil-
lion. This represents 3.32 percent of Chevron’s total 2011 
environmental expenditures.

In 2011, there were 92 loss-of-primary-containment incidents of significance 
(ANSI/API Recommended Practice 754 Tier 1) across the company, compared 
with 95 incidents in 2010. Of the 92 incidents, 63 occurred in Upstream and 
29 in Downstream, which includes Manufacturing and Chemicals.

 Notes to pages 42 and 43

  1 Chevron continues to use the upgraded GHG 

and energy reporting system (CGERS), improved 
by adding reporting mechanisms for electronic 
reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. 

 The 2010 emissions were restated to 60.2 metric 
tons of CO2 equivalent, as several business units 
improved their data collection and accuracy, 
especially in the United States, where GHG emis-
sions reporting became mandatory. 

 Increased production, new operations and 
increased flaring due to a disruption of 
operations in Angola drove some of the emis-
sions increases. The Pascagoula Refinery 
and the Yeosu Refinery increased production, 
which increased their emissions. Production 
changes in Canadian Upstream interests 
also drove emissions increases. At the same 
time, the increased emissions were more than 
offset by decreases in emissions due to the 
divestment of the Pembroke Refinery and 
the North River Mine (U.S.), improvements in 
Chevron Shipping fleet efficiency, and decreased 
production at the El Segundo Refinery. 

 Chevron calculates product emissions based on 
total 2011 Upstream liquids, gas and coal produc-
tion. The emissions factors used are from the 
American Petroleum Institute’s Compendium of 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for 
the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2004, 2009). 
Based on the International Energy Agency’s 
(IEA’s) Key World Energy Statistics (2011), these 
emissions represent 1.3 percent of global CO2 
emissions from fossil fuels. This amount is lower 
than the 1.7 percent of global CO2 emissions 
estimated in 2002.

 The IEA’s Key World Energy Statistics (2011) 
indicates 28,999 million metric tons of CO2 from 
fossil fuel emissions. Chevron divides its prod-
ucts combustion number by 28,999 million to 
obtain its percentage of 1.3 percent. 

 Chevron participates in the Global Gas Flaring 
Reduction Partnership. Since 2003, we reduced 
flaring and venting by 33 percent (operated 
basis). In Nigeria and Angola (85 percent of 
Upstream flaring), we plan to reduce flaring and 
venting by 50 percent by 2014.

 The 2011 flaring and venting emissions are 
based on flare gas volume of 898 million cubic 
feet per day plus venting of gas in CO2 equiva-
lent, which is 6 percent higher than in 2010. 
The increased flaring in 2011 is due to a disrup-
tion of operations in Upstream Angola.

 Chevron’s GHG emissions data are reported 
on an equity basis for all businesses in which 
Chevron has an interest, except as noted below. 
The following entities are not currently included 
in the Chevron corporate GHG inventory: 
Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LLC, the Caspian 
Pipeline Consortium, the Chad-Cameroon 
pipeline joint venture, Caltex Australia Ltd.’s 
Lytton and Kurnell refineries, and other refiner-
ies in which Chevron has an equity interest of 
16 percent or less. These are entities over which 
Chevron does not have full operational control 
or which do not generally follow Chevron’s 
corporate GHG inventory protocol or a compati-
ble protocol. At this time, GS Caltex Corp.’s 
Yeosu Refinery’s emissions data are submitted 
separately from the CGERS system. 

 Due to rounding, individual numbers may not 
sum to the total numbers.

  2 Direct emissions come from sources within a 

facility. Indirect emissions come from electricity 
and steam that Chevron imports, less the 
emissions credits from electricity and steam 
that Chevron exports. Grid credits account 
for electricity that Chevron exports and that is 
produced more efficiently than electricity 
from the regional or national grid. Per industry 
best practices, beginning in 2010, Chevron 
no longer accounts for grid credits in its power 
generation emissions.

  3 Chevron uses an energy index to measure 
energy efficiency improvements across 
its global operations. As of 2011, that index has 
shown a 34 percent improvement since 1992. 
The Chevron Energy Index is a measure of 
the energy intensity of its operations based 
on the estimated improvement of energy 
technologies and operational performance. 
The total energy consumption of its operated 
assets in 2011 was 760 million gigajoules 
(or 720 trillion Btu), at a cost of $7.0 billion. 

  4 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are derived 
primarily from fugitive emissions from equip-
ment (such as valves, pumps and compressors), 
flaring, venting, and flashing gas. Nitrogen 
oxides (NOX) and sulfur oxides (SOX) are com-
bustion byproducts.

  5 2009 and 2010 VOC air emissions are restated 
in this report. Kazakhstan VOCs are revised 
to include additional compounds that are not 
required to be included by regulations.

 “Other” includes Chevron Mining Inc.

 Due to rounding, individual numbers may not 
sum to the total numbers.

  6 Numbers shown on chart for Upstream are for 

Upstream and Gas operations.

  7 Secondary containment volume — which is not 
released to the environment — is included in 
the total volume listed at the end of each bar. 

  8 Spills to land, water and secondary containment 
that are greater than or equal to one barrel 
are included.

  9 Environmental expenditures were $2.7 billion 

($1.0 billion capital, $1.7 billion noncapital). Health 
and safety fines and settlements were 0.4 percent 
of total fines and settlements ($0.32 million).

 10 American Petroleum Institute’s Benchmarking 
Survey of Occupational Injuries, Illnesses, 
and Fatalities in the Petroleum Industry data are 
used as industry benchmarks. Occupational 
safety data include both injuries and illnesses. 
2011 benchmark data were not available at 
the time of publication.

 11 Data include catastrophic and major incidents only.

 12 Loss-of-containment incidents are unplanned or 
uncontrolled releases resulting in consequences 
equivalent to those specified by the American 
National Standards Institute/American Petroleum 
Institute (ANSI/API) Recommended Practice 754.

 Data from the former Atlas Energy, Inc., are 
included in Chevron’s employment, Total 
Recordable Incident Rate, Lost-Time Incident

Assurance Statement

Terms of Engagement
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Chevron 
U.S.A. Inc.

•  Reviewing the documented reporting requirements to validate 
consistency of scope, definition and reporting for each of 
the HES performance indicators.

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, Inc. (LRQA) was 
commissioned by Chevron U.S.A. Inc., on behalf of Chevron 
Corporation (Chevron), to assure its processes used to produce 
the Corporate Responsibility Report (CRR) for the calendar 
year 2011 (hereafter referred to as “the CRR”). Our terms 
of engagement were to review the processes for reporting 
health, environmental, and safety (HES) performance indica-
tors. Verifying the accuracy of data and information was 
not included in the assurance.

LRQA has reviewed Chevron’s CRR reporting processes since 
2008 (for the 2007 CRR).

Management Responsibility
Chevron’s management was responsible for preparing the 
CRR and for maintaining effective internal controls over the 
data and information disclosed. LRQA’s responsibility was 
to carry out an assurance engagement on the CRR in accord-
ance with our contract with Chevron.

Ultimately, the CRR has been approved by, and remains the 
responsibility of, Chevron.

LRQA’s Approach
Our verification has been conducted against the requirements 
of LRQA’s Report Verification procedure. The objectives of 
the assurance engagement were to validate the integrity 
of Chevron’s reporting processes and to evaluate consistency 
with the IPIECA/API/OGP Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on 
Voluntary Sustainability Reporting (2010). 

To form our conclusions, the assurance was undertaken as 
a sampling exercise and covered the following activities:

•  Visiting 18 entities, including 16 operating units on five conti-
nents, and addressing Chevron’s principal functional oil and 
gas, chemical and mining operations throughout 2011 to assess 
local understanding and implementation of Chevron’s HES 
reporting requirements.

•  Visiting Chevron Upstream and Gas headquarters in Houston, 
Texas, and Chevron Downstream and Chemicals headquarters in 
San Ramon, California, to assess business-unit understanding 
and implementation of Chevron’s HES reporting requirements.

•  Interviewing key personnel to identify and gain an understand-
ing of Chevron’s reporting requirements.

•  Reviewing the processes used at the corporate level to aggre-
gate data and information for inclusion in the final report.

Level of Assurance
The opinion expressed in this Assurance Statement has been 
formed on the basis of a reasonable level of assurance.

LRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach, it is our opinion that Chevron’s 
reporting process was effective in delivering HES indicators that 
are useful for assessing corporate performance and reporting 
information consistent with the IPIECA/API/OGP Oil and Gas 
Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting (2010). 

  It should be noted that:

•  Processes were in place that ensure that sites contributing 
to core HES metrics understood corporate reporting procedures 
and requirements.

•  Methods used for calculating each HES performance metric 
were clearly defined and communicated. 

•  Chevron’s reporting requirements for HES metrics were 
understood and carried out. Data collected at the site/local and 
business-unit levels were checked and aggregated into cor-
porationwide metrics.

•  Responsibility for annually reviewing and updating reporting 
guidelines was clear, with improvement in methodology 
regularly undertaken.

LRQA’s Recommendations
   Observations and areas for potential improvement are provided 
in a report to Chevron management. These observations do 
not affect our conclusions.

This document is subject to the provisions below: 
This Assurance Statement is only valid when published with the Report to which it refers.

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited, its affiliates and subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees or agents are, individually and collectively, referred to 
in this clause as the “Lloyd’s Register Group.” The Lloyd’s Register Group assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense 
caused by reliance on the information or advice in this document or howsoever provided, unless that person has signed a contract with the relevant Lloyd’s Register 
Group entity for the provision of this information or advice, and in that case, any responsibility or liability is exclusively on the terms and conditions set out in that contract.

Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control, it is possible that fraud, error, or noncompliance with laws and regulations may occur and not be detected. 
Further, the verification was not designed to detect all weakness or errors in internal controls so far as they relate to the requirements set out above, as the verification 
has not been performed continuously throughout the period and the verification carried out on the relevant internal controls was on a test basis. Any projection of the 
evaluation of control to future periods is subject to the risk that the processes may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with them may deteriorate.

The English version of this statement is the only valid version. The Lloyd’s Register Group assumes no responsibility for versions translated into other languages.
