A Message From Our CEO

Shared Progress  
Energy is essential to human progress — it creates jobs, fuels 
innovation and powers virtually every element of the global 
economy. Providing that energy safely, reliably and economi-
cally is a great responsibility that we take seriously. We are 
proud that 2010 was the safest year in our company’s history, 
giving us one of the best records for safety in our industry.

We recognize that business success is deeply linked to 
society’s progress. Our investments in communities — 
developed in partnership with those communities — also 
are investments in the long-term success of our company. 
This approach delivers mutual benefit and shared progress. 
In 2010, we invested $197 million in our communities, more 
than twice the amount we invested in 2006.

Over the past few decades, our industry has changed 
dramatically. New technology and advanced skills have 
combined to unlock new production and growth in geologic 
areas once beyond our reach. 

One of these frontiers, deepwater production, experienced 
a tragedy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, resulting in loss of 
precious life. It also took a toll on the economy and the 
ecology of the Gulf Coast. Following the BP Macondo 
incident, Chevron led the joint-industry task force to raise 
even higher standards for deepwater operations across the 
industry. The incident reinforced our own safety imperative 
to reach our goal of zero incidents wherever we operate. 
Toward that goal, all of our projects are guided by our 
strong safety culture. We leave nothing to chance because 
we have a deep, personal stake in operating safely — to 
sustain the public’s trust in our operations, to bring our 
employees safely home and to deliver value to those who 
invest in us. Our success rests on a culture true to our 
Chevron Way values — getting results the right way.

Corporate responsibility at Chevron begins with safe opera-
tions, but it doesn’t end there.

We make community investments in the three areas that 
we believe are the foundation of working societies the 
world over — health, education and economic development. 
Our investments in health focus on training, testing and 
treatment for such diseases as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and 
malaria, which are critical economic and public health chal-
lenges in some of our largest operating areas. 

Business and community partnerships that emphasize 
economic progress can help set countries on a better 
course. One such investment is the Niger Delta Partnership 
Initiative, launched in 2010 — an innovative, multipartner 
effort to promote economic development, conflict resolution 
and capacity building. Our initial commitment is $50 million.

Our investments in education can strengthen communities. 
As part of our California Partnership initiative, for example, 
we’ve teamed up with leading educational nonprofits to 
create opportunities in critical STEM subjects — science, 
technology, engineering and math — for underserved 
students. In 2010, we reached more than 245,000 students 
and 3,900 teachers in California.

Through multistakeholder collaboration, such as the 
Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, we 
are promoting respect for global human rights. To empha-
size the importance of our own commitment, in 2010 we 
developed plans and provided resources to implement our 
global Human Rights Policy.

As you’ll read in this report, our community investments 
have increased, our partnerships are stronger and our 
impact is greater. These successes demonstrate shared 
progress for business and communities.

Australia:
A Natural 
Partnership

A nature reserve is an unlikely site for  
a major new energy plant, but Chevron  
is showing how it can work.

Barrow Island, offshore Western Australia, is the site of the Gorgon natural gas project. 
Chevron has been safely producing oil for more than 45 years on Barrow.

$56 
billion

(AU$65 billion) will be 
contributed to Australia’s 
gross domestic product

10,000 
jobs 

will be created at peak 
construction

No. 1

in size, the Gorgon 
CO2-injection project 
is expected to be the 
world’s largest

Barrow Island, a Class A nature  
reserve off Australia’s west coast,  
will be home to the Gorgon Project, 
which will tap into vast natural gas 
resources 43.5 miles (70 km) north-
west of the island. The island’s rich  
and unique biodiversity has remained 
intact since naturalist John Thomas 
Tunney’s writings secured its designa-
tion as a wildlife refuge a century ago. 
Its conservation is a national priority.

Chevron is no stranger here, having 
successfully operated on Barrow for 
more than 45 years while minimizing 
our footprint on the island. Building 
on this environmental stewardship 
involves a mix of advanced technology 
and a commitment to detail, addressing 
everything from greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions to local concerns over light 
levels from our operations on Barrow’s 
nearby beaches where turtles lay 
their eggs. Our strong environmental 
performance has allowed us to expand 
operations, resulting in a benefit to our 
business and the Australian economy. 

Strengthening the Economy
At $37 billion (AU$43 billion), the 
Gorgon Project will be Chevron’s larg-
est investment, targeting 40 trillion 
cubic feet of gas. Gorgon represents 
the single biggest resource project 
in Australia’s history. Independent 
consulting firm ACIL Tasman estimates 
that Gorgon will contribute $56 billion 
(AU$65 billion) to Australia’s gross 
domestic product. More than $8 billion 
(AU$9 billion) has already been com-
mitted to companies in Australia — and 
total spending in Australia is targeted 
at $17 billion (AU$20 billion) over 
five years.

“Many people don’t realize that 
through Gorgon, Chevron is providing 
opportunities and benefits on a scale 
never seen before in this country,” said 
Chevron Australia managing director 
Roy Krzywosinski.

70%

of construction con-
tracts for workforce 
housing will go to firms 
in Western Australia

Above: Environmental scientist 
Daniel Joyce is at the site of the 
Wheatstone gas processing plant 
in Western Australia.

Natural gas will be offloaded from 
Barrow Island as liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) and transported mostly to 
Asian markets, while gas for Western 
Australia’s consumption will be 
piped ashore. Gorgon precedes our 
Wheatstone Project, a second offshore 
natural gas project currently in the 
planning stages.

Australia’s prime minister, Julia Gillard, 
toured the project site in March 2010 
and said, “Having been here and seen 
Barrow Island and [the] Gorgon Project, 
it’s given me a real sense of the size 
and scale of this project and what it is 
going to mean to the nation’s future. . . . 
This is a great project for employment 
in this country.” 

Reducing Emissions
Natural gas is the cleanest-burning 
 fossil fuel. Gorgon will include the 
world’s largest carbon dioxide– (CO2-) 
injection project, which will inject 
40 percent of the project’s GHG 
 emissions underground. This will make 
Gorgon one of the world’s least GHG-
intensive LNG facilities. The injection 
project will separate the CO2, a natural 
component of produced gas, and inject 
it 1.6 miles (2.6 km) beneath the island 
into a deep sandstone reservoir. The 
Australian government is a partner 
here,  having contributed $51 mil-
lion (AU$59 million) to the injection 
project as part of its Low Emissions 
Technology Demonstration Fund. 

The plan was recognized internation-
ally by the Carbon Sequestration 
Leadership Forum, a group of 
24 national governments and the 
European Commission. We will 
share data from the project, which 
will accelerate and enhance scien-
tific understanding of a technology 
some scientists believe could play 
an important role in reducing global 
GHG emissions.

Partnering With Residents of 
Western Australia
We are taking steps to make sure 
Gorgon benefits the residents of 
Australia, both economically and 
socially. Thus far, Gorgon has created 
4,000 jobs in Australia. At peak con-
struction, it will employ 10,000 people. 

A $394 million (AU$458 million) 
construction village is being designed 
and built by a joint venture between 
companies in Australia — Thiess, Decmil 
and Kentz. Thiess managing director 
David Saxelby said a significant aspect 
of the contract was that it offered 
enormous potential for local jobs, 
and up to 70 percent of the contract 
requirements would be sourced in 
Western Australia. 

Climate Change

Gorgon’s CO2–injection project is one of 
the many ways we are working to address 
concerns about climate change.

Now in its 10th year of implemen-
tation, our Action Plan on Climate 
Change continues to guide our 
efforts in greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions reduction, improved 
energy efficiency, and research 
and development in innovative, 
low-carbon energy technologies.

•  Since 1992, we have reduced the 

total energy consumption required 
to perform all our business opera-
tions by 33 percent compared with 
the energy we would have used to 
complete the same functions.

•  We advise customers on energy 
efficiency improvements and 
renewable power, reducing their 
energy use by an average of 
nearly 30 percent. 

•  In 2010, the Carbon Disclosure 

Project’s Leadership Index recog-
nized Chevron as a leader among 

energy companies for transpar-
ency in monitoring and disclosure 
of our GHG emissions and carbon 
management practices.

•  As a member of the Global Gas 

Flaring Reduction Partnership, we 
are working to minimize gas flar-
ing and venting. As of late 2009  
in Kazakhstan, Tengizchevroil —  
in which Chevron is a 50 percent 
partner — eliminated routine 
flaring. In Nigeria, Angola and 
elsewhere, we continue projects 
to recover gas that would have 
been flared.

•  We deployed a new enterprise-
wide system for reporting GHG 
emissions and energy efficiency, 
implemented a strategy to man-
age future carbon-market activity 
growth, and conducted third-party 
verification of our GHG emissions. 

For additional information on how we are addressing this issue, please

In 2009, Australia’s Ausco Modular 
was laying off workers. In 2010, it 
hired 200 people to build offices, labs 
and control rooms worth $51 million 
(AU$59 million) for Gorgon. Already 
some 80 vessels, employing hundreds 
of workers, are supporting Gorgon’s 
dredging and the delivery of supplies 
and materials. 

Other Australian companies have  
benefited through hundreds of  
jobs created in freight, construction, 
general utilities, accommodation,  
telecommunications and site prepara-
tion. Howard Porter, a local company, 
had 70 employees building 300 trail-
ers for Gorgon under a $17 million 
(AU$20 million) contract that Porter 
called the single biggest transport 
manufacturing order ever in West-
ern Australia. 

Gorgon also is a magnet for talent. 
A recent Chevron employee meeting  
in Perth included many people who  
had been on the job less than a week, 
but that’s business as usual as the 
company fills a new 13-story office 
tower with about 800 Gorgon workers. 

Our collaborative approach played a 
significant role in developing the native 
title agreements with the Kuruma 
Marthudunera people in June 2010 
and the Yaburara Mardudhunera peo-
ple in November 2010 for the Gorgon 
Project’s domestic gas pipeline. 

Under the Chevron-operated Gorgon 
Project Cultural Heritage Management 
Plan, Australian Aboriginal people  
are involved to help the project avoid

heritage sites. “When we were 
 surveying our country with the 
company [Chevron], we came across 
several important sites in the desig-
nated construction area,” Kuruma 
Marthudunera spokesperson Cyril 
Lockyer said. “And after talking with 
Chevron, the result is that the com-
pany will build the pipeline around 
these areas and not destroy these 
sites. This type of working relationship 
will help us preserve our heritage for 
future generations.”

With our commitment to Aboriginal 
employment, construction contrac-
tors and others are encouraged to  
hire Aboriginal people. Additionally, 
we are working to identify longer-term 
career opportunities. Peter Eggleston, 
Chevron Australia’s External Affairs 
manager, said, “We’re now very much 
a part of and are engaged extensively 
with Aboriginal communities in the 
areas near our operations.” 

Business and Nature Coexist
Barrow Island, once attached to the 
continent of Australia, now lies about 
43.5 miles (70 km) offshore, having 
been separated from the mainland 
and becoming a sort of living ark. It 
is home to more than 350 species of 
native plants, 14 species of mammals, 
100 species of birds and 54 species of 
reptiles. Some of them are found no 
other place on Earth. 

We have been working with Harry 
Butler, Ph.D., one of Australia’s pre-
mier conservationists, throughout  
oil production and Gorgon develop-
ment to minimize any impact to the 
island ecology. 

“Today, all the species I experienced 
when I first visited Barrow Island in 
1963 remain,” he said. “When you have 
a world-class quarantine process sup-
ported by a workforce that truly cares 
for the environment, this is what you 
can achieve.” 

8

To prevent invasive species and 
other pests from being brought onto 
the island, we have a rigorous and 
 expansive quarantine plan, which 
Western Australia’s Environmental 
Protection Authority said “likely 
represents the best practice in 
the quarantine management of a 
large operation.” 

Our quarantine management proce-
dure, in place for more than 45 years, 
has improved over time. Goods being 
shipped through the Dampier sup-
ply base are tagged with one of three 
colors to make sure the required 
procedures are taken. Nothing is 
shipped to Barrow without a green 
tag. At the Australian Marine Complex 
in Henderson is a quarantine wash-
down area resembling a huge parking 
lot and a giant shed big enough to 
cover a football field. There’s also a 
larger-than-life hair dryer that cleans 
vehicles and goods bound for the 
island. And the process doesn’t end 
when the freight is put on ships. At the 
island, inspectors can stop goods and 
return them to the mainland on the 
next barge. Today, Barrow is the only 
island in the region free from intro-
duced species such as cats, rabbits, 
rats and mice.

Yet another environmental con-
sideration is the nighttime lighting 
necessary for the new LNG plant. Four 
species of sea turtles nest on Barrow, 
and light can cause them and their 
hatchlings stress. 

Daniela Ratcheva, a senior envi-
ronmental engineer with Chevron 
Australia, delivered a detailed presen-
tation to a conference in Queensland 
in September 2010. She demonstrated 
how we engineered the plant’s lighting 
systems to not disturb turtles and to 
comply with the stringent environmen-
tal approval conditions and applicable 
safety laws and standards while not 
compromising safe  operability.

Thalanyji group, accompanies Chevron 
contract botanist Jerome Bull on a

survey at the Wheatstone site. Bottom: 
Equipment headed for Barrow Island is 
shrink-wrapped during quarantining.

We minimized the project’s footprint 
on the island itself. The seismic survey 
of the underground geology where 
CO2 will be injected was also modified. 
A conventional survey, consisting of 
clearing paths to accommodate heavy 
trucks that haul necessary equipment, 
would have disturbed about 700 acres 
(283 ha). Instead, a freight helicopter 
did most of the heavy lifting — approxi-
mately 15,000 separate lifts — while 
lighter equipment was carried by foot. 
By the end, fewer than 47 acres (19 ha) 
were disturbed. 

Donna Parker, CO2-injection project 
manager, is one of those who are proud 
of the achievement. “This extraordi-
nary effort by all involved was vital to 
delivering baseline survey results and 
maintaining our reputation as an envi-
ronmental champion of Barrow Island,” 
she said. 

Executive Interview

What

How

When

What is the biggest  
challenge that you face?

How are you addressing 
that challenge?

When will the Gorgon Project 
become a reality?

By 2030, world demand for energy 
is expected to grow by approximately 
33 percent — with Australia’s neigh-
bor, Asia, predicted to account for 
60 percent of that growth. Chevron is 
fortunate to find itself in Australia, sur-
rounded by natural gas resources on 
the doorstep of the growing demand 
in the region. The Gorgon Project alone 
is set to increase the supply of domes-
tic gas to Western Australia by about 
30 percent. We must link energy supply 
to energy demand while addressing 
the risks posed by climate change.

Benefits already are being realized. 
Though production of natural gas 
is not planned until 2014, billions of 
 dollars in contracts have been awarded, 
putting people to work. Approximately 
1,500 are employed on location on 
Barrow Island, and 4,000 across 
Australia are employed as a result of 
Gorgon. Those numbers will grow as 
the project  gathers pace.

The Greater Gorgon Area gas fields 
contain enough energy to power a  
city of 1 million people for 800 years. 
The Gorgon Project is long term and 
will benefit generations to come.

The development of Chevron’s  
world-class gas resources will provide 
Australia and the countries receiving 
the project’s LNG with opportunities  
to affect their greenhouse gas emis-
sions. Compared with the use of coal 
to generate electricity, natural gas 
from the Gorgon Project will have the 
same effect on global emissions as 
removing two-thirds of the vehicles 
from Australian roads.

Most supply-demand forecasts predict 
that natural gas will play an integral 
role in the energy mix as the world 
transitions to a lower-carbon future. 
The Gorgon Project and Australia are 
set to be global leaders in the appli-
cation of underground CO2-injection 
technology. We are committed to shar-
ing information from the monitoring 
program at Gorgon to assist in building 
a greater understanding around this 
emerging and important technology.

Roy Krzywosinski became managing 
director of Chevron Australia in 
January 2008 and helped steer the 
Gorgon Project to a final investment 
decision about 18 months later.

Angola:
Partnerships  
and Possibilities

Angola’s South Atlantic coast, a land of rainforests, savannas 
and agricultural highlands, is rich in natural resources and 
possibility. Our business operations and community partnerships 
there offer support to a population trying to improve its 
infrastructure and grow its economy. 

The Peace Agreement of April 2002 
marked the end of a nearly 27-year  
civil war that devastated the economy 
and increased Angola’s dependence on 
the oil industry. As the country recov-
ers, Chevron has been responding to 
community needs. Our investments in 
health, education and economic devel-
opment in Angola improve livelihoods 
and foster stable operating environ-
ments that contribute to our ability to 
conduct business. 

Following the Angola Partnership 
Initiative model, we are working to 
promote robust micro, small and 
medium-size businesses outside the 
oil industry. For example, we support 
the Luanda Business Incubator, a pro-
gram to strengthen the operational 
and technical capabilities of service 
providers. The program has trained 
more than 200 entrepreneurs in 
 business planning and helped create 
143 new jobs in 2010. 

Partnering for Sustainable  
Economic Growth
In 2002, we launched the Angola 
Partnership Initiative, with $25 million 
and a commitment to address needs 
beyond those near the vicinity of our 
operations, focusing particularly on 
regions most damaged by the war. 

“To many Angolans, the concept  
of entrepreneurship is new and  
needs nurturing,” said Eunice de 
Carvalho, Policy, Government and 
Public Affairs general manager for 
Chevron in Angola. 

We are also pioneering business 
programs for high school students. 
Working with the National Institute  
for Educational Research and Develop-
ment and the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization, our $1 mil-
lion contribution in 2010 is helping 
launch an entrepreneurship curriculum 
for more than 2,000 students in nine 
provinces. The Ministry of  Education 
plans to roll out the curriculum nation-
wide, reaching 500,000 students 
by 2013. 

In 2010, with support from the Euro-
pean Union, UNESCO and UNICEF, 
we partnered with the Ministry of 
Education and donated $1.5 million to 
implement a teacher training program. 
Nearly 400 teachers and administra-
tors attended.

Partnership  
With the Global Fund

Chevron’s partnership  
with the Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria has helped 
improve the health and 
well-being of millions of 
people in Africa and Asia. 
We made an initial $30 mil-
lion investment in the 
Global Fund between 2008 
and 2010. The Global Fund’s 
performance-based funding 
model and rigorous meas-
urement and evaluation 
system have demonstrated 
that our investment has 
yielded high-impact results, 

saving lives and improving 
health care in countries 
where we operate.

•  About 380,000 people com-
pleted voluntary HIV/AIDS 
counseling and testing.

Through our first three 
years of investment in 
Global Fund grants in 
Angola, Nigeria, South 
Africa, Thailand, Indonesia 
and the Philippines, we 
contributed to significant 
results, including the 
following:

•  As many as 3.4 million 
people were directly 
reached through HIV/AIDS 
prevention programs.

•  About 1 million malaria nets 

were distributed.

•  More than 1 million rapid-

diagnostic tests for malaria 
were distributed.

In 2010, we announced a 
commitment of an addi-
tional $25 million to the 
Global Fund, raising our 
six-year investment in the 
Global Fund to $55 million.

Promoting Economic Diversity
In 2007, Chevron became a minor-
ity partner in Banco Africano de 
Investimentos Micro Finanças (BMF), 
formerly called NovoBanco. Since  
then, BMF has made approximately 
$54 million in loans to Angolan entre-
preneurs. From 2006 to 2010, BMF 
opened 10 branches in five Angolan 
provinces, and in 2010, BMF provided 
$9.9 million in loans to Angolan micro 
and small entrepreneurs. Also in 2010, 
we contributed $500,000 to expand 
BMF’s operations in Cabinda. 

Joaquina Manuel, an entrepreneur  
who exemplifies the country’s opti-
mism, established a wholesale and 
retail business in the 1980s, but a 
national currency crisis drove it into 
bankruptcy. She started over with a 
$3,000 loan. Success bred success,  
and additional loans allowed her to 
expand her business. 

“These loans were like a rebirth for  
my business,” said Manuel.

Chevron is the largest  
foreign oil-industry 
employer in Angola;

88%

of Chevron’s employees 
in the country are 
Angolans

Cultivating Angola’s Fertile Land
While the country was once a recipi-
ent of global food assistance, Angola’s 
fertile soil, plentiful water, conducive 
climate and hardworking farmers led 
many donors to end support for food aid 
programs. But despite more of Angola’s 
farmers cultivating the land, most are 
producing at a subsistence level. Still, 
they have enormous potential to trans-
form their operations into businesses.

The ProAgro project, funded jointly 
by Chevron and the U.S. Agency for 
International Development from 2006 
through 2010, facilitated sustainable 
business relationships between produc-
ers, banks, processors and distributors 
of cash crops. The project provided 
technical assistance to more than 
5,500 farmers, who almost doubled 
their yields between 2007 and 2009.

Fighting Disease
Since 2008, when we funded a 
$350,000 vaccination campaign 
in Uige and Cabinda provinces, we 
have partnered with Angolan health 
authorities and UNICEF to provide vac-
cinations against the wild poliovirus.

Through these campaigns and the 
country’s other efforts, polio was 
thought to have been eradicated in 
Angola and neighboring Republic of 
the Congo for a decade. But in Novem-
ber 2010, an outbreak erupted in 
Brazzaville, Congo. By December, it 
had killed an estimated 220 people.

We responded by sending people  
and financial resources to prevent the 
disease from spreading into Angola, 
supporting an emergency campaign 
that vaccinated 624,000 people 
in Cabinda in December 2010 and 
donating $950,000 to the national 
campaign to fight polio, specifically 
for the provinces of Cabinda, Lunda-
Norte, and Lunda-Sul. More than 
15,000 Chevron employees, family 
members and contractors based in 
Cabinda province were vaccinated as 
part of the campaign. 

Polio is just one of the diseases that 
our programs address.

“In the past 20 years, Chevron and 
partners have invested more than 
$29 million in medical training and 
treatment for and education about 
infectious diseases and in support for 

Social  
Investments

Our success as a business is inextricably  
linked to the well-being of our employees and 
our  communities.

Social investments at Chevron 
aim to foster economic stability 
and improve quality of life. They 
are delivered through partici-
patory partnerships that build 
foundations for positive, last-
ing results. We invest in health, 
education and economic devel-

blood banks and the construction of 
health facilities all over the country,” 
said Dr. Ana Ruth Luis, Chevron’s medi-
cal director in Angola. 

We remain committed to helping  
stop the spread of disease through 
unsafe blood. With our partners — the 
Angola Ministry of Health, the Safe 
Blood for Africa Foundation, and the 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention — we established a safe 
blood program in Cabinda province. 
Our nearly 20 years of support for this 
blood bank has allowed for more than 
200,000 safe transfusions. 

Fighting malaria remains an important 
battle in Angola. In 2010, we sponsored 
the first entomological course on 
malaria in the country. Organized by the 
Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria and by the 
Corporate Alliance on Malaria in Africa, 
the course brought 41 health specialists 
from all 18 provinces to learn mosquito 
control techniques. In 2010, Cabinda’s 
program treated 25,317 children under 
age 5 and 5,408 pregnant women. 

“It takes community action and effec-
tive partnerships to fight a disease 
like malaria,” said Alan Kleier, manag-
ing director of Chevron’s Southern 
Africa operations in 2010. “We intend 
to continue working with the Ministry 
of Health and other partners toward 
prevention and treatment.”

The century-old relationship between Chevron 
and the city of Richmond is on a new path to 
strengthen the company and the community.

California, United States:
Finding Common 
Ground in Richmond

Chevron and the city of Richmond, 
California, share a rich history that 
stretches back more than a century. 
The refinery sits on about 2,900 acres 
(1,174 ha) 15 miles (24 km) north-
east of San Francisco and was built 
before Richmond was incorporated 
in 1905. Richmond then was a small 
but growing industrial area of about 
2,000 people. Today, it’s a city with  
a diverse economy of industrial, tech-
nological and maritime businesses  
and 103,000 residents. 

Together — through booms and reces-
sions, 19 U.S. presidents, and economic 
and social changes — the relationship 
between the refinery and the people 
of Richmond has evolved. Over the 
past two decades, there has been a 
growing interest in refinery activities. 
Some  citizens have expressed concerns 
about insufficient communication on 
issues such as community support, 
emissions and flaring.

“We listened to those concerns,” said 
Mike Coyle, refinery general manager, 
“and in 2008, we began efforts to 
strengthen local relationships. This is 
helping us overcome challenges that 
affect our business and the community.” 

We commissioned an independent 
nonprofit organization to interview 
community leaders. Coyle said the 
results proved enlightening. Among the 
findings: Citizen groups and nonprofit 
leaders felt that our community inter-
actions had decreased and that people 
were unaware of our long history of 
involvement. Many wanted us to be 
more active in helping the city address 
social and economic problems.

As a result, we are in the midst of an 
effort to renew and strengthen our 
relationships. We meet regularly with 
residents and leaders, and based on  
their input, we’ve invested in job crea-
tion, public safety and K–12 education.

Contra Costa Unified School District. 
“There’s a deep connection between 
Chevron and our students. Working 
together on science, math, engineering 
and other programs, we’re changing 
the student culture to raise expecta-
tions so that our students see college 
as the next step after high school.” 

Harter said program support instills a 
sense of optimism that can start with 
something as simple as new micro-
scopes. Science teacher Catherine 
Vanier needed lab materials to teach 
cellular biology to her seventh grade 
students at Richmond’s Lovonya 
DeJean Middle School. With the help 
of Chevron’s Fuel Your School program 
and DonorsChoose.org, Vanier was 
able to buy the sorely needed sup-
plies. In addition, the school received 
a $25,000 Chevron classroom grant. 
As a result, Chevron “has made a 
significant difference in the education 
of our students for years to come,” 
Vanier said. 

Our focus on supporting STEM (science, 
technology, engineering and math) 
education in California has resulted in 
more than 245,000 students and 3,900 
teachers benefiting from our commu-
nity programs in 2010. 

Another priority that residents voiced 
was economic opportunity. Chevron 
responded by supporting nonprofit 
organizations that increase local 
employment.

For example, we awarded the non-
profit Stride Center a $211,000 grant 
in 2009 to create a job-training 
program. David Benjamin, once an 
unemployed high school dropout, now 
has a promising future in technology 
after receiving computer training from 
the center. “I wasn’t doing too much 
with my life and was in and out of trou-
ble,” he explained. Now, he said, he’ll be 
qualified for jobs in computer technical 
support and software installation. 

Chevron Humankind

Our employees are active in 
nonprofits that strengthen 
communities where we live 
and work. In Richmond, for 
example, we mentor high 
school students interested 
in science, engineering, 
math and other technical 
careers; serve meals at 
local homeless shelters;  
and participate in commu-
nity improvement projects. 

Throughout our opera-
tions in the United States, 
employees participate in 
Chevron Humankind, the 
company’s U.S.  employee 
and retiree giving and 
volunteer program. Contri-
butions made to nonprofits 
through the program are 
generally matched dollar 
for dollar by the company. 
Since  Chevron Humankind 

began in 2008, 19,000 
participants plus com-
pany matches contributed 
more than $74 million 
to support more than 
12,000 nonprofits.

Above: Chevron employee 
Brent Tippen volunteers

as a second language in 
Richmond.

We also increased transparency. We 
responded to the call for information 
by creating public communications 
platforms, and for the first time in 
30 years, we held an open house and 
tour to allow the community to see our 
operations for themselves. The com-
munity had the opportunity to engage 
with us directly, and we could clarify 
misconceptions about our operations.

Investing in Our Community
In West Contra Costa County, unem-
ployment is more than 18 percent. 
Twenty-two percent of families in 
Richmond have incomes below the 
U.S. federal poverty level, and 40 per-
cent of adults did not graduate from 
high school.

To help the community address these 
challenges, we granted $3.7 million 

70%
reduction 
in regulated air 
 emissions has been 
achieved at the refinery 

in 2010 to nonprofits in Richmond and 
the county for education, youth leader-
ship programs, economic development 
and job training. But our investment in 
the community goes beyond financial 
contributions.

“Support from Chevron and its volun-
teers comes with accountability and 
an expectation of mutual benefit,” said 
Bruce Harter, superintendent of West

the animals that make it their home. 

Improving Operations
We continually strive to minimize air 
emissions and waste, use resources 
and energy efficiently, and minimize 
environmental impact.

The Richmond Advanced Recycled 
Expansion (RARE) Water Project is 
one example of our collabo rative 
approach. In drought-prone California, 
fresh water has always been a valu-
able commodity. Population growth 
and stringent environmental regula-
tions have increased its value. Water 
is also an essential component in oil 
refining, with each gallon of oil refined 
requiring one gallon of high-quality 
water. We are the San Francisco 
Bay Area’s largest refinery and thus 
the largest water customer for the 
East Bay Municipal Utility District 
(EBMUD), requiring about 11 million 
gallons a day. 

To reduce water use, the refinery and 
EBMUD completed a plant in 2010 to 
treat municipal wastewater for our 
steam-producing boilers. Each day, 
RARE sends 3.5 million gallons of 
treated wastewater to the refinery, 
in addition to the 4 million gallons 
of reclaimed water already used in 
the refining process. RARE saves 

enough drinking water to serve about 
a quarter of Richmond’s population 
and could reduce severe rationing 
in future droughts. “This coopera-
tive effort,” said Lesa McIntosh, an 
elected board director of EBMUD,  
“will benefit water customers well  
into the future.” 

Refinery air emissions have been a 
source of concern for the community. 
By installing new technologies and run-
ning plants more efficiently, we have 
reduced regulated air emissions by 
70 percent since the 1970s. A refinery-
wide flare-minimization program that 
began in 2007 has helped decrease 
flaring by more than 97 percent. As the 
region’s largest refinery, the Richmond 
Refinery represents approximately 
38 percent of oil refining capacity in 
the Bay Area but less than 1 percent 
of the volume of vented gas flared 
in 2009. 

While we have made progress, there is 
still work to be done. “Reestablishing 
a strong relationship and trust won’t 
happen overnight, and we are deeply 
committed to fulfilling that goal,” Coyle 
said. “We’ve recently taken some sig-
nificant steps, but this commitment is a 
marathon, not a sprint.” 

The 
Environment

Our efforts to reduce 
flaring and increase 
water efficiency in 
Richmond illustrate our 
continued commitment 
to minimize pollution 
and waste, conserve 
natural resources, and 
reduce the environ-
mental impact of our 
operations.

Across the company, we devel-
oped a corporate environmental 
stewardship process that pro-
vides a consistent, systematic, 
risk-based approach to manag-
ing aspects of the environment, 
including air, water, biodiversity 
and waste.

For example, in 2010, we devel-
oped an integrated, corporatewide 
freshwater management plan 
to enhance current activities on 
water stewardship.

mental stewardship, please visit

Kazakhstan:
Sea of Opportunity

In 1979, geologists discovered a 1-mile-thick (1.6-km) oil field  
near the windswept Caspian Sea. They named it “Tengiz,” 
Kazakh for “sea,” a fitting description considering its location 
and potential.

Today, Chevron is Kazakhstan’s 
largest private oil producer, holding 
stakes in the nation’s two biggest 
oil-producing projects — the Tengiz 
and Karachaganak fields. We hold a 
50 percent interest in Tengizchevroil 
(TCO), which operates the supergiant 
Tengiz Field. 

Our commitment to the region began 
in 1993 with the formation of TCO and 
the five-year, $50 million Atyrau Bonus 
Fund that developed infrastructure 
projects. Since then, we have continued 
to cultivate opportunities that result 
in economic and social change for 
many Kazakhstanis. Our business is 
enhanced by strong local suppliers and 
a skilled workforce.

“If you want to do business here, or 
anywhere else, you have two respon-
sibilities — business and community,” 
said Jay Johnson, president of 
Chevron Europe, Eurasia and Middle 
East Exploration and Production Ltd. 
“We satisfy both by encouraging our 
Kazakhstani employees to continue 
to develop their skills. That is why we 
work closely with local schools and uni-
versities. As the community benefits, 
so does our business.” 

At year-end 2010, 85 percent of TCO’s 
workforce was Kazakhstani. TCO spent 
nearly $1.35 billion on Kazakhstani 
services and materials. Ongoing train-
ing and education programs contribute 
to the high number of Kazakhstan 
citizens among TCO’s workforce and 
in leadership positions. 

A Commitment  
to Human Potential
Longtime Kazakhstani employees still 
talk about adapting to Chevron’s busi-
ness and engineering standards. Berik 
Dyussenov, TCO’s Health, Environment 
and Safety coordinator, said stand-
ards today are more stringent than 
what he saw during Tengiz’s infancy. 
Chevron’s decision “to partner with 
Kazakhstan on the Tengiz project was 
made shortly after Kazakhstan’s inde-
pendence,” he said. “The partnership 
brought new opportunities to us work-
ing in Tengiz and contributed greatly to 
our country’s economy.”

injection performance for disposing  
of the field’s wastewater. 

“My internship helped me apply  
the theoretical knowledge I obtained 
in college and expand my under-
standing of petroleum engineering,” 
said Texas A&M graduate Merey 
Shinikulova, now a TCO production 
engineer. “I worked on interest-
ing and challenging projects, and 
I was impressed that my projects 
were actually used after I left the 
internship.” 

Of the 12 new reservoir manage-
ment employees in 2010, 11 came 
from the program. Three of them 
completed master’s degrees at 
the Colorado School of Mines with 
funding from Chevron’s University 
Partnership Program. 

Supporting Business  
Development
Fostering emerging small businesses 
and suppliers is an important goal 
that we and our government and 
nongovernment partners share. 
Since 1997, TCO has provided more 
than $7.8 million to small business 
development loan programs that 
have helped entrepreneurs in agri-
culture, catering, and medical and 
community services.

Jay Johnson cited Byelkamit, a local 
company that has been working 
with TCO since 1997. In addition to 
numerous other projects in 2009, 
Byelkamit was the prime contractor 
on a large fixed-roof crude-oil storage 
tank and employed 600 local workers 
at peak construction. Prior to this 
project, a Kazakhstani contractor had 
never built a tank this large, a new 
capability for the country’s industry, 
developed with TCO’s help.

“We prefer to buy locally whenever 
we can,” said Johnson. “Byelkamit 

University Partnership Program

Chevron’s University 
Partnership Program 
engages with key universi-
ties throughout the world 
by providing scholarships, 
grants and employee 
involvement. Through these 
efforts, we have provided 
approximately $18 million in 
funding per year, support-
ing research and academic 
excellence to help develop 
the professionals needed 
in the energy industry. We 
consider these educational 
partnerships also to be 
 strategic investments in 
local communities.

In the United States, 
we support more than 
75 schools in areas critical 
to our energy future, such 
as engineering, earth 
science, finance, infor-
mation technology and 
environmental science. 
These programs include 
efforts to increase minority 
participation.

Internationally, we focus 
our involvement in locations 
of our strategic operations,  
including Indonesia, West-
ern Australia, Kazakhstan, 
Thai land, Brazil and the 

United  Kingdom. Further 
efforts are under way to 
finalize partnerships with 
universities in Angola and 
to explore partnerships in 
Poland and Bangladesh.  
We also pair programs at 
world-class institutions with  
less developed ones in order  
to strengthen the faculty 
and curriculum of the less 
developed programs.

of the KazNTU Society of 
Petroleum Engineers plans

and Gas Youth Forum in 2011.

During his career, Dyussenov visited 
Chevron facilities across the United 
States and Canada and credits Chevron 
programs for offering Kazakhstani 
specialists an opportunity to receive 
state-of-the-art training and learn best 
practices in environmental safety. 

Our program at the Kazakh National 
Technical University (KazNTU) 
started in 2007 and has provided 
scholarships for 150 graduate and 
undergraduate students. Working with 
the university and international and 
local environmental nongovernmental 
organizations, we introduced a major 
addition to the country’s curriculum: 
Energy Efficiency and Sustainable 

Development. This new course was 
introduced to all 23 technical univer-
sities in Kazakhstan. 

In 2010, TCO began working with 
Kazakhstan’s Bolashak (“future” 
in Kazakh) program, which allows 
talented students to study abroad 
with full government scholarships. 
Mike Sullivan, a reservoir surveillance 
coordinator, began an aggressive 
program to recruit Bolashak students 
for internships.

Students were paired with senior 
 mentors at TCO and were given  
a problem that required original  
research to solve. For example, one

Fueling Social Programs
Since 1993, TCO has invested more 
than $645 million in social programs 
in the Atyrau Oblast. In 2010, TCO 
spent $20 million on its Egilik (Kazakh 
for “benefit”) social infrastructure 
program, and Karachaganak Petroleum 
Operating, in which Chevron holds a 
20 percent interest, also contributed 
$20 million to social programs in the 
Western Kazakhstan Oblast. 

We and our affiliates have continually 
supported health programs, including 
current efforts to combat high rates  
of cardiovascular disease, a leading 
cause of death in Kazakhstan.

The Kazakhstan Association of  
Family Physicians and TCO are part-
nering to educate the local medical 
community and public about how to 
prevent cardiovascular disease. In 
one program, more than 100 doctors 
are being trained to diagnose and 
improve treatment. Another program, 
for doctors at the Atyrau Cardiovas-
cular Hospital, provided mentoring 
by surgeons from the Astana Cardio-
vascular Center.

Diversity

We need the diverse talents and full 
potential of every individual employee in 
order for Chevron to excel as a leader in 
the global marketplace. We recognize the 
benefits of maintaining a workforce that 
reflects the composition of the communities 
where we operate.

Our commitment to diversity and 
inclusion is more than words, more 
than a set of goals. Our actions 
speak for themselves.

•  We encourage managers and 
selection teams to hire from a 
diverse slate of candidates who 
represent a range of backgrounds.

•  Approximately 22,500 Chevron

U.S. Gulf of Mexico: 

Oceans  
of Promise

Chevron is a recognized leader in deepwater drilling. Our success in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico began more than 10 years ago when we tapped the Genesis Field 2,600 feet (792 m) below the water’s surface. Throughout that time, we have continued to drill safely by combining our technological know-how with a proven organizational culture of safety that begins with management and extends to employees and contractors.2010

Transocean’s Discoverer Clear Leader is on lease to Chevron in the Gulf of Mexico. Workers are seen here on the drillship’s helipad.Below the earth’s surface under  
more than 2,000 feet (610 m) of  
water rests a vast promise of global 
energy. Below this depth, the global  
oil industry tripled its offshore capacity 
to 5 million barrels a day in the past 
decade and ultimately could double 
that number by 2015. In the United 
States, production in the outer conti-
nental shelf, almost all of which is in 
the Gulf of Mexico, currently accounts 
for 27 percent of the nation’s oil and 
15 percent of its natural gas.

While offshore resources hold the 
promise of energy and profit, there are 
risks that have to be addressed.

“We know we can only operate with  
the public’s confidence that the energy 
we need will be produced safely and 
reliably,” said Chevron Chairman and 
CEO John Watson. “We have a very 
personal stake in operating safely 
because it is our home, too.”

One Team, One Goal
Our commitment to safe drilling  
begins with a corporatewide dedica-
tion to operational excellence. This 
emphasis translates into specific 
programs and standards, such as 
empowering  workers to stop work 
whenever they sense potentially 
unsafe operations, thus creating lay-
ers of protection in drilling practices, 
well design and construction.

David Payne, Chevron’s vice president 
of Drilling and Completions, said, “We 
address anticipated risks before we 
start, and we’re prepared to handle any 
others that come up during drilling.”

This approach was crucial at the  
Tahiti Field. Discovered in 2002, 
Tahiti, which is estimated to contain 
400 million to 500 million barrels of 
oil-equivalent recoverable reserves, 
represented a complex and dramatic 
challenge because it lies in more 
than 4,000 feet (1,219 m) of water,

375

deepwater wells have 
been drilled safely by 
Chevron around the 
world since 1987

while the reservoir itself is more than 
23,000 feet (7,010 m) below the water’s 
surface. Our team had to upgrade eight 
separate technologies just to finish 
its test well.

In 2010, we helped lead the joint- 
industry task force that made recom-
mendations to the U.S. Department of 
the Interior to raise industry stand-
ards on offshore equipment, operating 
procedures and subsea well control to 
even higher levels.

“A majority of these standards are 
already embedded in Chevron’s opera-
tions,” Watson told the U.S. Congress 

in 2010 after the BP Macondo well 
incident in the Gulf of Mexico. “ Chevron 
will adopt any new standards it doesn’t 
already apply.” He also stressed our 
commitment “to advancing safe opera-
tions through enhanced prevention, 
better well containment and interven-
tion, and improved spill response.”

Practicing Safety
In 2010, the company had a record-low 
injury and illness rate.

“At Chevron, one goal overrides all 
 others: making sure everyone goes 
home safe every day,” Watson said.

One example of our safety culture 
is our regularly held “safety stand-
downs” with drilling personnel  
and rig crews to reinforce safety  
practices. We share these exten-
sive reviews of drilling processes, 
well-control contingency plans and 
risk management plans across our 
global operations.

Since 1987, we have safely drilled 
375 deepwater wells around the 
world. Deepwater drilling is par-
ticularly challenging because of the 
pressures involved, but our expertise 
with blowout prevention was evident 
during the task force work. A blowout 
preventer (BOP) is a series of valves 
that prevent a well’s fluids from escap-
ing from the well. We have an in-house 
team of employees dedicated solely to 
understanding BOPs and subsea well 
interventions. We also operate our 
own well-control school, have drilling 
specialists overseeing every major well 
and constantly partner with suppliers 
on equipment quality. And we have the 
only operator-owned cement lab in 
North America.

Operating a deepwater rig costs more 
than $1 million a day, and activat-
ing the BOP causes delays. “But 
we’d rather activate a BOP even 
when it isn’t necessary than risk a 

blowout,” said Payne. He sees BOPs 
like seat belts: It’s important that they 
exist and are used, but it’s always 
 better if they’re not needed.

Rick Graff, who spent the past 13 years 
on Chevron’s Gulf of Mexico rigs as a 
deepwater drilling engineer, said his 
first boss taught him constant respect 
for high-pressure reservoirs in deep 
water. “We take great care as we drill 
to keep them safely contained with cas-
ing, cement, drilling mud and constant 
monitoring,” Graff said. “In my view, 
the human element is just as important 
as the mechanical.”

‘ At Chevron,  
one goal overrides  
all others: making 
sure everyone  
goes home safe  
every day.’ 

John Watson
Chairman and CEO

At our Covington, Louisiana, operations 
center, offshore installation managers 
such as Mark Davis train on a simula-
tor that is unique to our industry. The 
simulator mirrors high-tech control 
rooms on production platforms in the 
Gulf of Mexico.

The training creates scenarios as 
diverse as fluctuating pressures on 
equipment, changing flow rates, and 
loss of communications between com-
puter and equipment.

Operating 
With Excellence

Our industry-leading performance is due to 
our commitment to excellence, from project 
design through operation.

Chevron’s Operational Excellence 
Management System (OEMS) was 
developed to systematically man-
age all aspects of safety, health, 
the environment, reliability and 
efficiency to achieve industry-
leading performance. The system 
provides specific expectations for 
all employees and contractors to 
participate in promoting safety, 
caring for the environment, and 
making sure the company’s opera-
tions run reliably and efficiently.

Chuck Taylor, vice president of 
Corporate Health, Environment 
and Safety in 2010, said protecting 
people and the environment is a 
company priority and a core value. 
“Many companies say this and 

know what it means conceptually. 
We are incredibly fortunate to work 
in an enterprise where protecting 
people and the environment is both 
a practice and a heartfelt value,” 
he said.

Over the past decade, our safety 
record has gone from trailing 
the industry to leading it. Our 
Days Away From Work Rate has 
dropped 90 percent, and nearly 
800 fewer workers were injured in 
2010 than were injured a decade 
ago. Since 2001, we’ve reduced 
the number of spills by 50 percent 
and reduced our spill volume by 
nearly 80 percent. And since 1992, 
we’ve improved our own energy 
efficiency by 33 percent.

Gulf Relief

We provided $10 million to 
five Gulf Coast community 
organizations that par-
ticipated in environmental 
and economic relief, spill 
response and cleanup after 
the BP Macondo well inci-
dent in the Gulf of Mexico.

One group was the 
National Audubon Society. 
Our Pascagoula, Missis-
sippi, refinery helped the 
group establish the Gulf 
Coast Audubon Volunteer 
Response Center to man-
age more than 35,000 
inquiries by volunteers 
wanting to assist in Loui-
siana, Mississippi, Florida 
and Alabama.

“Our collaboration with 
Chevron allowed us to 
inform and mobilize volun-
teers across the country,” 
said Audubon President 
David Yarnold. “We provided 
much needed relief efforts 
and built a corps of citizen 
scientists committed to the 
long-term conservation of 
coastal bird populations and 
habitats across the Gulf.” 

Other groups we funded 
were The Nature Con-
servancy and America’s 
WETLAND Foundation,  
which used funding to 
address coastal restora-
tion; the Committee for 
Plaquemines Recovery, 

which supported hard-
hit commercial fishing 
communities along the 
Louisiana coast, where 
we have major facilities; 
and Greater New Orleans, 
Inc., which applied funding 
to economic recovery in 
concert with the Louisiana 
Economic Development 
Department.

“These community part-
ners had immediate needs 
to mobilize and respond 
to impacts on local 
residents,” said Warner 
Williams, vice president of 
Chevron’s Gulf of Mexico 
operations, “and we con-
tinue to work with them.” 

Every employee and contractor  
has the authority and responsibility 
to stop work when he or she sees  
an unsafe act or condition.

Above: Offshore installation managers John Naquin (left) and Mark Davis train 
on simulators at Chevron’s Covington, Louisiana, operations center. The simula-
tors replicate the control room on the Blind Faith production platform.

“The simulator hones our skills to  
operate safely and is a unique tool  
to improve response through practice 
during the training,” said Davis. “The 
simulator is not just about reading a 
procedure, it’s about doing it.”

Stop-Work Authority
The authority to stop work on a 
project is another critical factor in 
keeping workers safe, and this author-
ity extends to every employee and 
contractor. It includes five steps: Stop 
the unsafe or at-risk act with those 
potentially at risk, notify a supervisor  
if he or she is present, address the 
issue, resume work after the issue 
has been resolved, and share what 
is learned with others.

Barry Smith, who was the offshore 
installation manager for Chevron’s 
Tahiti project in 2010, said the team 
reviews stop-work cases before every 
shift. “We discuss the incident to learn 
from it and to positively recognize 
those who used stop-work author-
ity,” Smith said. “We want everyone 
to understand there are no negative 
repercussions for taking the time to do 
things right.”

During the Tahiti hookup and com-
missioning phase, which lasted eight 
months, the Tahiti workforce logged 
stop-work authority more than 1,400 
times, about five a day, for issues as 
diverse as hurricane-force weather  
and a shipping container that had 
arrived without a proper seal. Smith 
said there were almost 120 work stop-
pages onboard Tahiti in 2010.

“On Tahiti, I estimate that 60 percent 
to 70 percent of our work stoppages 
are called by our contractors,” Smith 
said. “This is a testament to our safety 
culture and to our business partners’ 
understanding that when we say it, we 
mean it. Our contractors notice that 
we ‘walk the talk.‘” 

Executive Interview

Gary Luquette
President, Chevron North America  
Exploration and Production Co.

Gary Luquette became president of Chevron North America Exploration  
and Production Co. in April 2006. He chaired the governing board that 
oversaw four joint-industry task forces formed after the BP Macondo well 
incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Why

Why is it important that  
we return to work now 
in the Gulf of Mexico?

Oil and natural gas will be primary 
energy sources for decades to come. 
Production in the outer  continental 
shelf — almost all of which is in the 
Gulf of Mexico — accounts for 27 per-
cent of U.S. oil and 15 percent of U.S. 
natural gas supplies. Chevron alone 
has more than 13,000  employees 
living and working in Gulf States. We 
provide jobs, economic growth and 
government revenue.

What

What was the biggest  
challenge you faced in  
the aftermath of the BP  
Macondo well incident?

While this incident was the responsi-
bility of a single operator, the entire 
industry felt the impact. We needed 
an immediate and unified industry 
response to learn from this tragedy 
and make sure it would never be 
repeated. That’s why the industry 
called together hundreds of experts 
to form four joint-industry task forces 
to identify tangible improvements that 
could be made in blowout prevention, 
well intervention and oil spill response. 
I was asked to chair the governing 
board that oversaw their work, and 
I assumed this role because I felt 
strongly that the industry needed to 
take quick and decisive action in order 
to earn the right to return to drilling in 
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

When

When will the results of these 
task forces become a reality?

We have made significant progress. 
In addition to submitting numerous 
reports on  lessons learned to the 
U.S. Department of the Interior, we 
made recommendations in such key 
areas as well design, cementing and 
safety. Many of these recommenda-
tions evolved into regulations that 
are helping companies operate at a 
higher standard.

And even after we submit our final 
reports from the task forces, the 
industry will continue to work together 
to improve operations and incident 
response. We committed to a number 
of initiatives that will show sustained 
improvements through technology, 
research and development, and train-
ing. We are safer today than we ever 
have been, and we will continue to 
improve in the years ahead.

Nigeria:
Healthy Employees,  
Healthy Community

Chevron’s business interests and community interests  
are linked, so our efforts to fight disease benefit all.

Chevron Nigeria Ltd. reaches out  
each day to people in Nigeria’s bus-
tling cities and small towns to improve 
health through workplace and com-
munity-based HIV/AIDS, malaria and 
tuberculosis programs. While combat-
ing disease, we encounter prevailing 
myths and misconceptions, a social 
fabric that leaves women and children 
especially vulnerable, and a geography 
that makes it difficult to reach people.

“We believe we can make a difference 
through our health programs, that  
we can save lives and give back hope,” 
said Femi Odumabo, Policy, Govern-
ment and Public Affairs general 
manager for Chevron Nigeria Ltd. 

Many of the programs Chevron  
Nigeria Ltd. supports are part of 
our global strategies to help com-
bat  disease. In Nigeria, Chevron’s 
partnerships and programs target 
employees, contractors, suppliers 
and communities. We work together 
with local leaders, governments and 

nongovernmental organizations,  
youth groups, congregations, shop-
keepers, and others active in the 
diverse communities of Nigeria.

A fundamental element to operating 
successfully is a healthy workforce. 
“The threat of HIV/AIDS to our 
 employees is inseparable from the 
threat it presents to communities 
around our operations. Taking a lead 
position in the fight against AIDS  
is the right thing to do, and it is good 
business,” said Andrew Fawthrop, 
chairman and managing director of 
Chevron’s Nigeria and mid-Africa 
operations. 

Information, Creating Hope
As medical protocols for HIV/AIDS 
have evolved, communication, educa-
tion and access remain hurdles. “While 
many people in urban centers are 
informed, you still meet people in rural 
areas who don’t know anything about 
the  disease,” said Dr. Chinwe Okala, a 
Chevron public health physician.

Reducing the stigma associated  
with the HIV infection is important to 
battling it, according to Okala. “A few 
months ago,” she said, “a colleague 
said he had overcome his fears and  
had an HIV test. He tested positive, 
but in the same breath added that he 
wasn’t worried because he knew he 
and his family would be fine, thanks  
to the training on HIV he’d received 
from us. When I saw his smile, I knew  
in his case we had made progress.” 

Reaching Women and Children
In Africa, HIV/AIDS disproportionally 
affects women, increasing the risk of 
mother-to-child transmission. Most  
of the 57,000 babies born HIV-positive 
in Nigeria each year become infected 
by their mothers. Through our invest-
ment in a Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria grant in 
Nigeria, we have helped 50,213 HIV-
infected pregnant women receive  
a complete course of antiretroviral  
treatment to prevent mother-to-child  
transmission. And to empower women

who have HIV/AIDS, we provide 
microcredit to help them develop 
employment opportunities. 

Promoting Wellness
We partner with the National Agency 
for the Control of AIDS to deliver a 
workplace wellness program to small 
and medium-size businesses in Lagos. 
One of these organizations is the Lady 
Mechanics Foundation, an auto-repair 
training program that empowers young 
women. Along with learning a skill, the 
women learn about disease prevention 
and treatment. Peer educators, includ-
ing employee volunteers from Chevron, 
provide disease- awareness training 
to the staff, who in turn help educate 
the community.

Efforts include distributing mosquito 
nets to fight malaria. During a visit 
to Ejigbo (a Lagos suburb) to demon-
strate net installation, Chevron and 
Lady Mechanics volunteers visited 
a mother in her home. “Today she is 
showing others how to install the net, 
and this is creating a multiplier effect 
in awareness and good health care 
practices,” said Sunday Okegbemiro, 
Chevron Corporate Responsibility 
coordinator. “Knowing that these 
relatively inexpensive nets could very 
well save someone’s life is remarkable 
and unforgettable.”

Different Roads to Treatment
The Chevron-sponsored Riverboat 
Clinic, now a decade old, has become 
crucial in delivering primary health 

Empowering Communities  
for Their Own Progress

Since 2005, we’ve engaged 
various communities near 
our operations through 
Global Memorandums of 
Understanding (GMOUs). 
The GMOUs are multiyear 
agreements between the 
communities, Chevron and 
state governments. 

Local participation in the 
company’s social invest-
ment decisions is vital. “It’s 
how we’re giving greater 
ownership of development 
activities to local communi-
ties,” said Dennis Flemming, 
community engagement 
advisor for Chevron Nigeria 
Ltd. in 2010.

The eight GMOUs cover 
projects in five states 
of the Niger Delta. Each 
agreement has a Regional 
Development Committee 

(RDC) that advocates for 
community interests and 
leads spending decisions. 
Each RDC’s subcommittees 
monitor accounting, con-
flict resolution and project 
management. 

The participatory, capacity-
building approach is visibly 
changing these communi-
ties. Since 2005, Chevron 
Nigeria Ltd. has disbursed 
more than $56.7 million to 
the RDCs for a wide range 
of projects, including build-
ing bridges, constructing 
solar-powered water facili-
ties, equipping hospitals 
with medical supplies and 
leading youth workshops. 

To further improve the 
RDCs’ effectiveness, in 
2010, we ran a series of 
workshops on subjects such 
as financial management, 

government budgeting, 
lobbying processes and 
community relations. In 
2010, 849 people had 
been trained. 

The benefits from the 
GMOUs now reach more 
than 400 communities, 
villages and chiefdoms, 
involving 600,000 people 
in economic, health, educa-
tion and environmental 
projects. In 2010 alone, 
we contributed more than 
$10 million to eight new 
GMOU projects.

Also in 2010, we launched 
the Niger Delta Partnership 
Initiative, with an initial 
investment of $50 million 
for economic develop-
ment, conflict resolution 
and capacity building in 
the region.

Supporting Women and Children

“Chevron operates in some 
of the most challenging, 
complex and dynamic 
places in the world. We 
believe that empowering 
women and children with 
the resources, knowledge 
and tools they need to be 
successful members of 
their communities creates 
healthier communities.  
And healthy communities 
enable us to form long- 
term relationships in the 
geographies in which we 
conduct business,” said 
Rhonda Zygocki, Chevron 

executive vice president  
for Policy and Planning.

The United Nations 
Millennium Development 
Goals 3, 4 and 5 were 
established to empower 
women and children 
through gender equality 
and maternal and child 
health. Our efforts align 
with these goals.

Internationally, our initia-
tives to promote gender 
equity have focused on train-
ing, economic  development  

and health. In coun-
tries such as Brazil and 
Kazakhstan, training 
programs resulted in 
job placements, and in 
Bangladesh, programs led 
to handmade goods being 
sold in markets around the 
world. We contribute to the 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria, 
whose grants have created 
anchor programs that 
produce results in AIDS 
education, treatment and 
reducing mother-to-child 
transmission rates.

care and disease intervention to 
thousands of people in 33 towns along 
the Escravos and Benin rivers in the 
Niger Delta. The floating clinic carries 
doctors and nurses, who bring medi-
cines and perform surgeries. Services 
include prevention education, malaria 
programs for pregnant women and 
children under 5, and free immuniza-
tions for approximately 1,000 women 
and children yearly. 

We annually give $1.5 million for  
the boat and medical supplies, and the 
Delta State government provides the 
medical staff. Without the riverboat 
docked in these communities, the near-
est facility would be a hospital more 
than 62 miles (100 km) away, accessible 
only through serpentine delta creeks. 

Education: A Disease-Fighting 
Investment
To address Nigeria’s need for skilled 
health professionals, we and our 
Agbami deepwater partners created 
the merit-based Agbami Medical 
Professionals Scholarship. Over the 
past two years, Chevron gave $5 mil-
lion to students of medicine, dentistry, 
nursing and laboratory sciences from 
the Delta, Ondo, Bayelsa, Rivers, Lagos, 
Imo, Akwa Ibom, Abia, Cross River and 
Edo states. The deepwater partners 
also spent $6 million to build and 
equip 20 laboratories across Nigeria, 
in institutions from grammar schools 
to universities.

Human Rights 

Our commitment to respecting human rights 
is embodied in The Chevron Way. To further 
this commitment, we adopted a Human Rights 
Policy in 2009. 

The policy, which replaced our 
2006 Human Rights Statement, is 
now a standing corporate policy in 
our Business Conduct and Ethics 
Code. All employees are required 
to comply with the policy. In 2010, 
we developed tools and processes 
associated with implementing the 
policy, and full implementation is 
expected by 2013. These efforts 
are governed by an executive lead-
ership body and guided by a global 
cross- functional team.

The policy addresses four  
human rights areas relevant to 
our business: employees, secu-
rity providers, the community 
and suppliers. Our corporate 
policies, management processes, 

community investment programs 
and participation in voluntary 
initiatives are complementary and 
help reinforce our commitment to 
respecting human rights in each 
of these areas. 

For example, human rights con-
siderations are embedded in our 
Operational Excellence Manage-
ment System; our Environmental, 
Social and Health Impact Assess-
ment; our leadership in industry 
collaboration; and our participa-
tion in the Voluntary Principles 
on Security and Human Rights. 
Ongoing engagement with our 
stakeholders provides us with 
 valuable input on the implemen-
tation of our policy.

in exploration and production in Asia. So, too, began our 
journey of shared progress in the region.

and employees in

32

In Indonesia, two simple words,  
gotong royong, convey the complex 
idea of cooperation, of offering assis-
tance, sharing burdens and working 
with others. For decades, we have 
embraced gotong royong, working with 
Indonesians to strengthen economic 
opportunities that benefit operations 
and local communities. 

“Helping improve social and economic 
conditions beyond our operations 
promotes a better standard of living 
and expands our ability to conduct 
business,” said Steve Green, manag- 
ing director of Chevron’s Indo Asia 
operations in 2010. “In addition to  
providing opportunities to businesses 

that supply our operations, we help 
support a diversity of ventures, such 
as agriculture, fisheries and home-
based businesses.”

Chevron’s operations range from 
crude oil and natural gas to geo-
thermal projects in West Java. Our 
Salak and Darajat projects, together 
with our geothermal projects in the 
Philippines, make us the world’s larg-
est producer of geothermal energy, 
a renewable resource that turns the 
earth’s steam to electricity while 
producing almost no greenhouse 
gas emissions.

Supporting Local Businesses
Our investments in Indonesia create 
a diversity of jobs. About 97 percent 
of our employees and managers are 
Indonesian nationals, while many other 
nationals are employed by our local 
suppliers. These businesses play an 
important role in providing the services 
and supplies we need to operate. 

Through education, training and fund-
ing, we work with businesspeople such 
as Erinawati, a maintenance contractor 
in Minas who wanted to become part 
of our supply chain. She said, “At first 
I knew nothing about projects like this. 
Then I attended a workshop organized 
by Chevron. We were shown how to 
prepare proposals and bids.” 

33

Erinawati learned that to work with 
Chevron, businesses must meet certain 
standards of production, technology 
and safety. She earned a Chevron Local 
Business Development (LBD) certifi-
cate, qualifying her to bid on contracts 
for fence painting and drainage. “I’m 
now able to empower not only myself 
but also the many people on my team —  
my neighbors and young people from 
around here,” Erinawati said.

The LBD program has helped more 
than 4,600 small companies and 
cooperatives in Riau, East Kalimantan 
and West Java. Workshops provide 
training in health and safety, environ-
mental management, procurement, 
business ethics, project management, 
technology and financial management. 
LBD participants grew their businesses 

from $1.3 million in 2001 to more than 
$123 million in 2010. 

Since LBD began, more than 815 small 
suppliers have been certified, 3,600 
contracts have been awarded and 7,200 
jobs have been created. In all, we have 
purchased $52 million in local goods 
and services. The Indonesian Ministry 
of Energy and Mineral Resources recog-
nized the success of the program with 
its Padma Community Development 
Award, the second time Chevron has 
received this award.

Microfinancing Grows Businesses
Microfinancing provides Indonesians 
with business opportunities. The pro-
grams we support, through the delivery 
of low-cost loans, reach a variety of 
enterprises outside of our operations. 

Educating Professionals

Since 2001, Chevron has 
sponsored Politeknik Caltex 
Riau, the province’s first 
polytechnic university. 
More than 880 students 
have graduated, and 
about 85 percent found 
jobs within three months 
of graduation.

Following the 2004 tsunami, 
more than 300 students 
from Aceh completed a 
three-month program at 

the polytechnic, studying 
construction, electrical 
installation and comput-
ers — obtaining skills that 
would help them rebuild 
their communities. About 
80 percent of these gradu-
ates are now employed in 
Aceh, and several started 
their own businesses, 
employing others.

In September 2008 — 
through a partnership 

between Chevron, the 
governments of Aceh 
and Nias, and the U.S. 
Agency for International 
Development — a second 
polytechnic opened its 
doors, offering courses 
in disciplines essential to 
industry, such as electron-
ics engineering, robotics 
and information technology. 
Currently, Politeknik Aceh 
has 580 students. The first 
class will graduate in 2011.

“Microfinancing is about enabling 
people to build businesses and employ 
others, resulting in stronger com-
munities,” said Ted Etchison, Chevron 
senior vice president for operations in 
Kalimantan. “Microfinance is not char-
ity. It’s about building capability and 
empowerment, and it places the respon-
sibility for success on the participants. 
We help plant the seed. The people then 
develop their own livelihoods.” 

In East Kalimantan and West Java, we 
partnered with government-owned 
financial institutions Permodalan 
Nasional Madani and Baitulmaal 
Muamalat to form the Community 
Enterprise Development program, 
offering access to low-cost loans and 
management training to community-
based business groups and small 
businesses.

“Before [microfinancing], it was dif-
ficult just to keep my small business 
running, but now I can make a tidy 
profit,” said Wistiningsih, a vegetable 
seller at Petukan Market in Balikpapan. 
“The money we earn every day can be 
used as capital to buy vegetables to 
sell. Thanks to the help we’ve received, 
my children have been able to go 
to school.” 

In Salak and Darajat, home to our geo-
thermal operations, we helped establish 
farmers’ networks, where farmers 
turn idle land into fields of abundant 
crops. We provide training, and the

farmers support and share knowledge 
with each other. In Pasirwangi, Garut 
Regency, we initiated the pioneering, 
mosque-based Muamalat Community 
Micro Enterprise program. Currently, 
four mosques participate, providing 
entrepreneurs with low-cost loans.

Promoting Entrepreneurship
We are committed to helping  create sus-
tainable livelihoods and self- sufficiency. 
Those livelihoods come in many forms.

In Dumai, known for its exquisite Malay 
textiles, we support a program to pre-
serve the traditional art of weaving. We 
provided training, hand looms, and the 
construction of a center and gallery. 

In Garut Regency, we support goat 
breeding; farmers earn money not only 
by selling goats but by selling goat 
manure as fertilizer to organic farmers. 

In our efforts to preserve the Mount 
Halimun Salak National Park, we and 
our community partners helped launch 
ventures such as organic gardening 
and rabbit breeding to help people 
develop more sustainable livelihoods. 
Traders and craftspeople, for example, 
are encouraged to switch from making 
furniture from park timber to cultivat-
ing vegetables and fruits.

Each day in Indonesia, we embrace 
gotong royong — a chance for business 
and communities to work together 
and thrive. 

Renewable  
Energy

To meet the need for affordable and  
reliable energy, the world will have to rely 
on all sources.

While applying new technologies to develop oil and natural gas 
resources, we also are investing in renewables.

We are the world’s largest producer of geothermal energy, and we 
continue to explore for more geothermal resources in Indonesia and 
the Philippines.

Our investments in renewables focus on technology that can operate at  
industrial scale without subsidies. For example, Catchlight Energy LLC,  
our joint venture with Weyerhaeuser Co., is working to commercialize 
advanced biofuels made from forest-based resources. 

In California, we are developing and demonstrating solar  technology 
that will produce steam needed for production operations at our 
Coalinga oil field.

GHG Emissions

In 2010, our total emissions were 59.2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, exceeding our goal 
of 59.0 million metric tons.1 In 2010, the reporting basis for total GHG emissions Chevron used 
was revised to exclude power generation grid credits to align with industry best practices. If the 
grid credits of 0.9 had been included, the net emissions of 58.3 would have achieved the goal. 
Our GHG emissions intensity in 2010 was approximately 33 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per 
1,000 barrels of net oil-equivalent production from our Upstream operations, up from 32 metric 
tons in 2009. Our Downstream intensity was approximately 34 metric tons of CO2 equivalent 
per 1,000 barrels of crude oil that was input into our refineries, down from 36 in 2009.

Our preliminary goal for 2011 is 60.0 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. We expect to achieve 
further emissions reductions through energy efficiency improvements and reduced flaring 
and venting. We also expect normal production levels and emissions to resume in areas where 
 disruptions occurred in 2010; and we expect emissions from new facilities that will begin opera-
tion in 2011.

We estimate that combustion of our products resulted in emissions of approximately 418 million 
metric tons of CO2 in 2010, approximately 2 percent more than the 410 million metric tons in 2009.  
We calculate product emissions based on total 2010 Upstream liquids, gas and coal production.  
The emissions factors used are from the American Petroleum Institute’s Compendium of 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry,2 published 
in 2004 and revised in 2009. When compared with the International Energy Agency’s Key World 
Energy Statistics (2010 edition), these emissions represent approximately 1.4 percent of global 
CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, which is lower than the 1.7 percent of global CO2 emissions when 
we first began estimating the GHG emissions from our products in 2002. 

Waste

In 2009, we began reporting a total waste metric to track the amount of total hazardous and 
nonhazardous waste that is recycled (which includes reused and recovered) from our operations. 
In 2010, total recycling was 59 percent of generated hazardous waste and 42 percent of generated  
nonhazardous waste.

 Notes to pages 38 and 39

  1 In 2010, Chevron deployed a new greenhouse 
gas (GHG) and energy reporting system. The 
new system incorporates the reorganization of 
Global Downstream and emissions estimation 
methodologies from mandatory GHG report-
ing requirements imposed in the U.S. state 
of California and nationally in Australia, the 
European Union and the United States. Going 
forward, these systematic changes will make 
comparing emissions with years prior to 2010 
difficult. Nevertheless, the 2009 to 2010 net 
increase of approximately 2.2 million metric tons 
of CO2-equivalent emissions can be attributed  
to several factors. Beginning in 2010, in conform-
ance with industry best practices, Chevron no 
longer accounts for grid credits in its power 
generation emissions, which increased emissions 
by more than 0.9 million metric tons. Azerbaijan 
International Operating Co. is now included in 
the corporate inventory, resulting in an emis-
sions increase of more than 0.4 million metric 
tons. Operationally, flaring emissions in Angola 
increased due to turnaround activity, and emis-
sions in U.S. Midcontinent operations increased 
due to new gas processing. Improved data col-
lection and accounting also account for the 
increased emissions from the Canadian Upstream 
operations as well as from Shipping operations, 
which now account for time- chartered vessels. 
Emissions increases were offset largely by flare 
reductions in Nigeria and at Tengiz in Kazakhstan 
and by decreased emissions at the Pascagoula 
Refinery, which experienced high turnaround 
activity in 2010. Other emissions offsets resulted 
from the shutdown of a mine in New Mexico and 
the sale of marketing assets.

 The 2010 flaring and venting emissions number 
is based on flare gas volume of approximately 
846 million cubic feet per day plus any venting 
of gas in terms of CO2 equivalents.

 Chevron’s GHG emissions data are reported 
on an equity basis for all businesses in which 
Chevron has an interest, except as noted 
below. The following entities are not currently 
included in the Chevron corporate GHG inven-
tory: Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., the Caspian 
Pipeline Consortium, the Chad/Cameroon 
pipeline joint venture, Caltex Australia Ltd.’s 
Lytton and Kurnell refineries, and other refiner-
ies in which Chevron has an equity interest of 
16 percent or less. These are entities over which 
Chevron does not have full operational control 
or which do not generally follow Chevron’s 
 corporate GHG inventory protocol or a compat-
ible protocol.

 Chevron’s 2007–2009 emissions have been 
restated, primarily due to a data revision by one 
business unit, resulting in an annual emissions 
reduction of nearly 0.3 million metric tons.

 Due to rounding, individual numbers may not 
sum to the total numbers.

  2 Direct emissions come from sources within a 

facility. Indirect emissions come from electricity 
and steam Chevron imports, less the emissions 
credits from electricity and steam Chevron 
exports. Grid credits account for the  electricity 
Chevron exports that is produced more effi-
ciently than electricity from the regional or 
national grid.

  3 In 2010, Chevron’s total energy consumption for 
Chevron’s operated assets was 747 trillion Btu 
(approximately 788 million gigajoules), based 
upon a lower heating value. This performance 
is an improvement over 2009’s consumption 
of 770 trillion Btu (approximately 812 million 
 gigajoules). 2009 numbers have been restated. 
In 2010, Chevron changed its reporting of energy 
consumption from including nonoperated joint-
venture refineries to reporting on operated 
refineries only.

  4 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derive 

primarily from fugitive emissions from equip-
ment (such as valves, pumps and compressors), 
flaring and venting, and flashing gas. Nitrogen 
oxides (NOX) and sulfur oxides (SOX) occur during 
 combustion.

  5 In 2010, Chevron improved its estimation meth-
odology and updated the emission factors in 
its guidance documents and tools. The updated 
methodologies resulted in variances in reporting 
compared with 2009.

 2010 reported VOC emissions were lower than 
in 2009. The VOC emissions from Nigeria/Mid-
Africa operations decreased due to the use of 
updated methodologies, and International and 
Americas Products emissions decreased due to 
divestitures of our transportation fleet and facili-
ties. This decrease was somewhat offset by Asia 
South operations, which reported an increase 
due to a change in flaring operations.

 2010 NOX and SOX emissions were each reported 
to be higher than 2009. In each case, a signifi-
cant portion of the increase can be attributed to 
Shipping operations, which updated its emission 
factors to better account for the fuel and engine 
types specifically used by ships.

 Other increases resulted from power operations 
in the IndoAsia region, which began reporting 
NOX emissions in 2010. Saudi Arabia/ Partitioned 
Zone reported an increase in SOX emissions due 
to an improved method for  tracking gas sent 
to flares.

 Global Gas, previously reported as “other,” 
was included with Upstream in 2009 and 2010. 
“Other” includes Chemicals, Chevron Business 
and Real Estate Services, Chevron Mining Inc., 
Chevron  Environmental Management Co., and 
Corporate Aviation.

 Due to rounding, individual numbers may not 
sum to the total numbers.

  6 Global Upstream average oil concentration  
in discharges to water increased in 2010  
mainly due to pit maintenance and a new  
procedure driven by regulatory requirements  
for testing oil-in-water concentration in  
IndoAsia operations.

 Manufacturing and Chemicals average oil con-
centration in discharges to water decreased 
mainly due to the construction of a new efflu-
ent treatment plant that came fully on line in 
November 2009 at the Pascagoula Refinery.

  7 Secondary containment volume — which is  

not released to the environment — is included  
in the total volume listed at the end of each  
bar. Approximately 21 percent, or 2,529 barrels, 
of the total volume was spilled to secondary  
containment in 2010. 

  8 All spills to water are included. Spills to land  
and secondary containment that are greater 
than or equal to one barrel are included.

  9 Environmental fines and settlements  

were $93.9 million in 2010 and accounted  
for 3.24 percent of our total environmental  
expenditures. Total environmental expendi-
tures were $2.9 billion, of which capital 
expenditures were $1.4 billion and non capital 
expenditures were $1.5 billion. 

 Health and safety fines and settlements 
accounted for approximately 0.2 percent of 
the total fines and settlements, representing 
$0.19 million.

Assurance Statement

Scope of the Assurance
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, Inc. (LRQA) was engaged 
by Chevron U.S.A. Inc. to assure the reporting processes used 
in the creation of Chevron’s 2010 Corporate Responsibility 
Report (“the Report”). The objectives of the review were to 
validate the integrity of Chevron’s reporting  proc esses and to 
evaluate consistency with the IPIECA/API Oil and Gas Industry 
Guidance on  Voluntary  Sustainability Reporting (2010). LRQA 
has reviewed Chevron’s Corporate Responsibility Report 
reporting processes since 2008 (for the 2007 Corporate 
Responsibility Report).

The LRQA scope of assurance was limited to processes for 
the reporting of health, environmental and safety (HES) 
performance indicators. Verification of the accuracy of data 
and information was not included in the assurance scope. 
The Report has been prepared and approved by Chevron 
management, who are solely responsible for the collection, 
presentation, and accuracy of all data and information con-
tained within it.

Approach
LRQA’s assurance approach was risk-based and undertaken  
as a sampling exercise. It covered the following activities:

•  Visiting Chevron’s Global Upstream and Gas facility in Midland, 
Texas, and Chevron’s  Downstream refinery in Pascagoula, Mis-
sissippi, to assess local understanding and implementation of 
 Chevron’s HES reporting requirements.

•  Visiting Chevron’s Downstream and Chemicals headquarters in 
San Ramon, California, to assess  business unit understanding 
and implementation of Chevron’s HES reporting requirements.

•  Interviewing key personnel to identify and gain an understand-
ing of Chevron’s reporting requirements.

•  Reviewing the documented reporting requirements to  validate 
consistency of scope, definition and reporting for each of the 
HES performance indicators.

•  Reviewing the processes used at the corporate level to  aggregate 
data and information for inclusion in the final report.

Conclusions and Findings
To form our conclusions, LRQA obtained sufficient evidence 
considered necessary for us to give limited assurance of 
Chevron’s HES reporting processes. Based on the scope of the 
assurance and the data and information presented for review, 
nothing has come to our attention that would cause LRQA 
not to believe that Chevron’s reporting process is effective in 
delivering HES indicators for the purpose of evaluating and 
communicating corporate performance in these areas. 

Our other conclusions:

•  Processes are in place that ensure that sites contributing to 
core HES metrics understand corporate reporting procedures 
and requirements.

•  The methods to be used for calculating each HES performance 
metric are clearly defined and communicated. 

•  Chevron’s reporting requirements for HES metrics are under-
stood and carried out. Data collected at the site/local and 
business unit levels are checked and aggregated into corpora-
tionwide metrics.

•  Responsibility for annually reviewing and updating reporting 
guidelines is clear, with improvement in methodology  regularly 
undertaken.

•  Chevron’s reporting process is effective in delivering HES 
indicators that are useful for assessing corporate performance 
and reporting information consistent with IPIECA/API/OGP  
Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary  Sustainability 
Reporting (2010).

Observations and areas for potential improvement are provided 
in a report to Chevron management. These  observations do not 
affect our conclusions.

Third-Party Liability   LRQA, its affiliates and subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees or agents are, individually and collectively, referred to in this clause  
as the “Lloyd’s Register Group.” The Lloyd’s Register Group assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense caused by 
reliance on the information or advice in this document or howsoever provided unless that person has signed a contract with the relevant Lloyd’s Register Group entity for 
the provision of this information or advice, and, in that case, any responsibility or liability is exclusively on the terms and conditions set out in that contract.

LRQA’s Competence and Independence   LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on a rigorous appraisal of their training, qualifications 
and experi ence. The team conducting the assurance of the Report was multidisciplinary and has been involved in assurance assessments from the outset of external 
verification of nonfinancial performance reports. LRQA’s internal systems have been designed to manage and review assurance and certification assessments. This involves 
independent review by senior management of the outcome derived from the process applied to the assurance of corporate reports.

Independence of LRQA From Chevron   LRQA and Chevron operate as discrete and independent legal entities. LRQA provides Chevron with third-party attestation assess-
ment services to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 as well as certi fication assessment services to other ISO standards. The assurance, attestation and certification assessment 
services are the only work undertaken by LRQA for Chevron. 

Conflict of Interest   LRQA is part of the Lloyd’s Register Group. Lloyd’s Register Group entities recognize that potential conflicts of interest may exist that could have  
an impact on its independent assurance and certification activities. Lloyd’s Register Group entities are committed to identifying and managing such conflicts so that they 
do not adversely affect its independence and impartiality. To protect the integrity, neither LRQA nor any other Lloyd’s Register Group entity will provide services that 
create a conflict and compromise the independence and impartiality of third-party assurance and certification. The Lloyd’s Register Group entities will never verify their 
own solutions to a customer’s problem.
