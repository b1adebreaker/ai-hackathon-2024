Energy portfolio

We are one of the only energy companies pur-

suing an “all of the above” energy strategy. 

We believe developing and maintaining a 

diversified energy portfolio is essential to 

successfully reducing carbon emissions while 

maintaining reliability and affordability. 

Over the past decade, we have significantly 

transformed our electricity generation mix.

Since 2010, we have invested $20 billion in 

developing low-carbon and carbon-free 

resources, and we have added more than

Recruitment 

Southern Company’s Talent Acquisition 

organization uses a variety of strategies 

to attract top talent. We join forces with 

high schools, technical schools and uni-

versities to recruit and prepare students 

to pursue careers across the energy value 

chain – including power generation, 

power delivery and nuclear energy.

Our military recruitment efforts have had 

a significant impact on our hiring. Veterans, 

National Guard and reserve members cur-

rently comprise approximately 10 percent 

of our systemwide workforce and com-

prised 16 percent of our new hires in 2018.

Responsibly transitioning our generating fleet

Southern Company will continue to 

pursue a diverse portfolio that includes 

low-carbon and carbon-free resources 

and energy efficiency resources. We 

will continue our industry-leading R&D 

with a particular focus on technologies 

that lower GHG emissions, and con-

structively engage with policymakers, 

regulators, investors and customers to 

support outcomes leading to a low-

carbon future. 

We will ensure the transition of our gen-

erating fleet is in a manner responsible 

to our customers and meets the needs 

of the communities we serve.

Achieving our goals depends on many 

factors, including natural gas prices and 

the pace and extent of advancements in 

low- to no-carbon energy technologies.
