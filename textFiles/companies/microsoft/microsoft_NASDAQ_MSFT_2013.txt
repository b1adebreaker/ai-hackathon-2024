About This Report

Back to Contents

To our stakeholders,

This past year, we took the first big, bold steps forward in our 
transformation to a devices and services company. In fact,  
in July 2013, we announced we are rallying behind a single 
strategy as One Microsoft. We declared that Microsoft’s focus 
going forward will be to create a family of devices and services 
for individuals and businesses that empower people around 
the globe at home, at work, and on the go for the activities 
they value most. 

Fiscal year 2013 was a pivotal year for Microsoft in every 
sense of the word — and that was reflected in our citizenship 
work. This report describes that work and shares our vision 
for what lies ahead. Published at the same time as our annual 
financial report, it provides a full accounting of our citizenship 
priorities and performance. Our commitment to citizenship 
is brought to life by the work we do in serving communities, 
championing the growth of our people, and meeting our 
commitment to responsible business policies and practices. 

Through our Technology for Good program, we provided 
more than 70,000 nonprofits in more than 100 countries with 
affordable access to technology. We also developed a program 
to donate Office 365 to nonprofits in 41 countries to help 
them better serve their communities. 

We made strong strides in helping our company and industry 
address climate change. This year, we met our goal of carbon 
neutrality by establishing an internal carbon fee to guide 
responsible choices and practices that help us minimize our 
environmental footprint. 

We also enhanced our transparency practices by releasing 
our first report of law enforcement requests for Microsoft 
account user data. This report detailed the number of data 
requests we received from official legal entities, the number 
of requests we granted, and the rigor of our review process 
for each request. 

This year we celebrated our employees’ commitment to making 
a difference with our 30th employee giving campaign, in which 
the company matches employee financial and volunteer con-
tributions. In FY13, Microsoft and our employees gave more 
than $100 million to more than 18,000 nonprofits worldwide, 
helping us surpass the $1 billion milestone of total contributions 
since our first campaign in 1983.

I believe our citizenship commitments and actions will con-
tinue to make significant contributions to business and 
society as we advance our strategy of providing a family of 
devices and services for the activities people value most. 

Thank you for your interest in Microsoft. We welcome your 
thoughts and suggestions.

FY13 also saw the launch of Microsoft YouthSpark, a global 
initiative to connect hundreds of millions of youth with oppor-
tunities for education, employment, and entrepreneurship. 
In its first year, YouthSpark empowered more than 100 million 
youth to imagine and build a better future for themselves 
and their communities.

Sincerely, 

Steven A. Ballmer 
CEO, Microsoft Corp.

Working responsibly

Good corporate citizenship starts at home. To meet 
our responsibilities as a global company, we’re con-
tinually working to create a respectful and rewarding 
work environment for our nearly 100,000 employees.

We’re also pioneering new ways of reducing our 
environmental impact. This year, we introduced  
an internal carbon fee that helped us meet our  
FY13 goal of carbon neutrality. In addition, we’re 
continually strengthening expectations for our 
hardware production suppliers to improve the 
working conditions and environmental perfor-
mance of electronics factories around the world. 

We recognize the important responsibility we have 
to respect human rights, and we work to bring the 
power of technology to bear to promote respect for 
human rights throughout the world. Through the 
Microsoft Technology and Human Rights Center, 
we’re working internally to promote the integration 
of human rights into the company’s culture, business 
operations, and strategies. Externally, we’re seeking 
to advance public understanding of the role busi-
ness can play in driving respect for human rights. 

“ Good corporate citizenship plays 
a vital role in our mission to help 
people and businesses realize their 
full potential. We’re inspired every 
day by our employees’ passion for 
their communities, and we honor 
their commitment by driving social 
change with hundreds of nonprofit 
partners around the world.”

Lori Forte Harnick, General Manager,  
Citizenship & Public Affairs

Since the release of our first product in 1975, we’ve 
demonstrated the promise of computing to change 
the world. But as we’ve grown as a company, so 
have the world’s social and economic challenges. 
We’re responding by applying our technology, 
ingenuity, and collaborative spirit to help solve 
these critical challenges and create fulfilling and 
exciting opportunities for people everywhere.

We focus our commitment to corporate citizenship 
in two ways: working responsibly in our own business 
and serving our communities around the world. 

Microsoft was once  
again recognized as a 
corporate citizenship 
leader with its inclusion 
in the 2013 Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices 
and the FTSE4Good Index.

Serving communities

Citizenship governance

We’re active members of the communities every-
where we do business.

At the heart of our efforts is the passion of our 
employees, who generously donate their time and 
money to causes around the world. This year, the 
30th year of our employee giving campaign, we 
met an exciting milestone — $1 billion in employee 
contributions and Microsoft matching gifts to more 
than 31,000 nonprofits since 1983. 

Launched in September 2012, our Microsoft 
YouthSpark initiative is also a major focus of our 
community work. Through partnerships with  
governments, nonprofits, and businesses, we are 
working to empower young people to imagine  
and realize their full potential by connecting them 
with greater education, employment, and entre-
preneurship opportunities. 

Furthermore, we donate, on average, $2 million a 
day in software to more than 70,000 nonprofits 
around the world — one of many ways our technol-
ogy and resources help nonprofit organizations 
serve individuals and communities in need. 

The Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of our 
board of directors oversees the company’s policies 
and programs that relate to public policy and  
corporate citizenship. The committee’s oversight 
includes public issues of significance to Microsoft 
and our stakeholders that may affect Microsoft’s 
operations, performance, or reputation.

Our Citizenship and Public Affairs team has day-to-
day responsibility for all citizenship-related work, 
including stakeholder engagement. As part of our 
Legal and Corporate Affairs Group, the 30-plus-
person team develops and coordinates our global 
strategy, supports our local citizenship teams 
worldwide, and partners with external stakeholders 
to fulfill our citizenship mission. 

More broadly, citizenship at Microsoft relies on the 
combined efforts of all our employees, including 
colleagues in dozens of other leadership roles, 
business and operational groups, and global sub-
sidiaries. Together, they help us identify the societal 
challenges where Microsoft can add the greatest 
value, develop and implement new strategies and 
programs, and monitor our progress.

Setting priorities and  
stakeholder engagement

We regularly communicate with thousands of 
stakeholders, including global human rights 
experts, environmental nongovernmental organi-
zations (NGOs), and parents concerned about  
their children’s safety and education. Those con-
versations help inform and guide our citizenship 
strategies and programs.

External frameworks

Our work is informed by international frameworks 
such as the Global Reporting Initiative’s 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, the United 
Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business  
and Human Rights, and the UN Global Compact. 
This report serves as the annual Communication  
on Progress of our commitment to the UN Global 
Compact (see index on page 103). 

Our stakeholder engagement takes several forms. 
Employees from our business and operational 
groups regularly identify and engage with stakehold-
ers in the course of their daily work activities. Our 
Citizenship and Public Affairs team also manages a 
number of stakeholder engagements and external 
relationships to help guide our strategies.

Our business

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) was 
founded in 1975. Our mission is to enable people 
and businesses throughout the world to realize 
their full potential by creating technology that 
transforms the way people work, play, and commu-
nicate. We develop and market software, services, 
and hardware devices that deliver new opportuni-
ties, greater convenience, and enhanced value to 
people’s lives. We do business worldwide and have 
offices in more than 100 countries.

Where we are

Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft 
employed approximately 99,000 people on a full-
time basis in more than 100 countries/regions and 
territories in FY13. Approximately 58,000 employees 
were based in the United States, and 41,000 were 
based in other countries.

Engaging our customers  
and partners

Our success depends on creating new and compel-
ling products and services, while also building strong 
relationships with our customers and partners. 
Listening and responding to customers is core to 
our business. We keep in touch through online 
feedback forms, support communities, product 
satisfaction surveys, usability studies, research 
forums, and our customer service Twitter account, 
@MicrosoftHelps. The insights we gain help us 
understand and respond to our customers’ and 
partners’ experiences. We also use information 
drawn from global customer and partner satisfac-
tion surveys as a measurement for employee, 
executive, and regional performance. 

Our partner ecosystem — approximately 640,000 
mostly small to medium-size local businesses around 
the world — develop, market, sell, and service 
Microsoft products, supporting millions of jobs and 
contributing to local and global economic growth.

Investing in innovation

In FY13, we invested $10.4 billion in research and 
development — equal to 13 percent of revenue —  
focused primarily on product development. To stay 
competitive, we make strategic, long-term invest-
ments in research and development across a broad 
array of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning 
communication and collaboration, entertainment, 
business and e-commerce, advertising, and devices. 

To drive future growth, we focus our efforts on:

•  Initiating and embracing disruptive  

technology trends

•  Entering new product and geographic markets

•  Inspiring broad adoption of our products  

and services

The people who power our innovations drive our 
success. We compete for talented employees from 
universities and private companies by offering 
broad customer reach, a wealth of resources, and 
competitive compensation.

We also collaborate with top universities through 
Microsoft Research — one of the world’s largest 
computer science research organizations — to

Innovating for good

Computing innovations continue to yield dramatic 
benefits to individuals, organizations, and societies, 
and nowhere is this more evident than in the 
potential of computing to tackle complex social 
challenges. In addition to pushing boundaries in 
the design of Microsoft products, services, and 
technologies, we pioneer solutions to help improve 
the health of millions worldwide, preserve endan-
gered cultures, and strengthen communities. 

Here’s a sampling of our social innovations in FY13.

•  The team at Microsoft Research Cambridge is 
working to develop software that helps physi-
cians more accurately and rapidly identify the 
anatomy of aggressive brain tumors, a feat that 
will enable better-targeted therapy. 

•  Microsoft Research and Microsoft Mexico, 

together with the Universidad Intercultural Maya 
of Quintana Roo and the government of the state 
of Quintana Roo, presented a preview of the 
Project Mayan-Microsoft Translator Hub to help 
preserve and personalize the Mayan language.

•  Microsoft Research helped launch the Queensland 
University of Technology’s Open Source Software 
Group and Virtual Lab, giving students the 
resources to create software solutions for real-
world problems and encouraging them to 
participate in projects to better their community.

•  Microsoft Research committed to sponsor four 
more years of partnership with the National 
Center for Women & Information Technology, 
which aims to advance diversity and innovation 
in computing.

Our researchers also apply their talent, technology, 
and insights to develop solutions that reduce envi-
ronmental impact and mitigate the effects of climate 
change. Read more in our Environment section.

Physicians in New Delhi, India, and around the world are using 
technology developed by Microsoft to deliver better health care.

Serving Communities / Microsoft YouthSpark

“ Young people are taking the lead in 
driving change in their lives and 
their communities. We’re inspired 
by their smarts and their passion, 
and we’re committed to helping 
them pursue their dreams every 
step of the way — not just because 
it’s the right thing to do, but 
because the future of the global 
economy depends on it.”

Lori Forte Harnick, General Manager,  
Citizenship & Public Affairs

Young people face a world that’s rapidly changing. 
As economies shift, industries emerge, and tech-
nology sets the pace, the gap between those who 
have access, skills, and opportunities and those 
who don’t is glaring.

We believe technology can help bridge this oppor-
tunity divide and secure the future of young people 
and the global economy. That’s why we’re empow-
ering youth by increasing access to technology and 
equipping them with the tools and skills they need to 
succeed. Through our partnerships, programs, and 
initiatives, we’re inspiring youth to imagine and build 
a better future for themselves and their communities. 

We’re empowering youth with the technologies and skills  
they need to build a better future.

Empowering youth through  
technology and education

For young people to succeed in today’s economy —  
and help build the economy of the future — they 
need direct access to both technology and relevant 
skills, along with support from teachers, leaders, 
governments, and nonprofits. We’re connecting 
youth with the resources they need to make a real 
impact for a better tomorrow.

•  Helped youth gain new skills, education, and 

training by providing YouthSpark grants to non-
profits worldwide. As part of our commitment  
to create opportunities for 300 million youth 
globally over the next three years, we launched 
partnerships with the European Youth Forum; the 
China Foundation for Youth Employment and 
Entrepreneurship; Trust for the Americas; and the 
African Centre for Women and ICT, among many 
other youth-focused nonprofits. In FY13, we 
awarded grants to a total of 186 nonprofit orga-
nizations in 62 countries. 

•  Accelerated learning and collaboration among 

students and teachers worldwide through Office 
365 for Education, which provides access to 
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, and a range of 
communications tools, including email, instant 
messaging, group video, and voice chat. 

•  Fostered shared learning experiences around the 
world while building global communities for  
students to meet new people, speak to experts, 
and share ideas through Skype in the Classroom. 
Nearly 2 million students worldwide have  
benefited from the program.

Microsoft is helping transform education by  
equipping teachers and preparing youth with  
the technology skills they need to succeed.

•  Empowered educators with technology to 

enhance learning in their classrooms through 
Partners in Learning. The Partners in Learning 
Network added 788,000 educators from  
134 countries and reached 10 million students  
in FY13.

•  Addressed the urgent need to improve com-
puter science education during K–12 years by 
placing Microsoft employees into high schools 
across the United States as part of our Technology 
Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS) 
program. In the 2012–2013 school year, 1,500  
students from 35 schools in seven states gained 
access to computer science courses to help 
inspire and prepare them for university study.

•  Gave educators resources, training, and software 
to help them teach computing and technical 
classes through the Faculty Connection program, 
which reached 5.4 million students in FY13.

possible for their futures through programs that 
develop new skills, engage leaders, and ignite 
imaginations.

•  Provided a platform for young innovators to gen-
erate groundbreaking ideas and create powerful 
business solutions through Imagine Cup, the 
world’s premier youth technology competition. 
More students competed in Imagine Cup world-
wide in FY13 than ever before, with an increase of 
more than 70 percent compared with 2012. 

•  Created the global Innovate for Good online 
community, which encourages and enables 
youth to collaborate, inspire, and support each 
other’s groundbreaking ideas for social change. 
Launched in 2012, the program brought together 

more than 2,200 members in 76 countries in  
its first year through local events and online 
engagement tools. 

•  Championed technology and technology-focused 

careers for high school girls as part of our 
DigiGirlz program, which fosters connections with 
Microsoft employees through hands-on computer 
and technology workshops. 

•  Advanced the teaching and learning of technical 
skills during the critical high school and college 
years through DreamSpark, which offered more 
than 12 million students and educators free 
access to Microsoft designer and developer tools.

•  Developed kids’ interests in computer program-
ming at an early age with Kodu Game Lab, which 
teaches youth how to design and build their own 
video games for free.

A group of students from the United Kingdom won $50,000 
as the first-place winners of the Microsoft Imagine Cup 
Innovation Competition with their mobile phone application 
“soundSYNK.” The app creates impromptu social networks 
that allow people to stream music simultaneously through a 
group of phones, effectively creating a symphony of speakers.

Turning opportunity into action

Bill Reese, President and CEO
International Youth Foundation (IYF)

IYF prepares young people to be healthy, 
productive, and engaged citizens. Its  
programs are catalysts for change that 
help youth learn, work, and lead.

In September 2013, we released “Opportunity for Action,” a report 
commissioned by Microsoft to commemorate the one-year anniver-
sary of the company’s YouthSpark initiative. In the report, we 
analyzed the potential of recent trends in youth entrepreneurship, 
second-chance education and training, and advanced skills related  
to information and communications technology, including coding 
and programming, to turn the global “youth bulge” into an economic 
and social asset. 

The report comes at a critical time, as voices around the globe are 
echoing an urgent call for action on youth employment. Far too 
many lack the resources, skills, and opportunities to stay in school, 
obtain and keep a decent job, and become constructively engaged 
in their community. 

The benefits of youth entrepreneurship and employment are clear.  
A “youth bonus” could pay out dividends for decades by making  
people’s lives more productive; contributing to thriving families,  
communities, and local economies; and building a more peaceful  
and equitable society.

In “Opportunity for Action,” we emphasize the need for concerted, 
organized action that will lift us beyond today’s array of pilot youth 
development programs to a place where significant investments are 
made in proven practices and programs. Fortunately, corporations 
like Microsoft are increasingly stepping to the fore, taking the lead in 
forging public-private partnerships with other corporate, govern-
ment, and civic leaders to support youth development worldwide. 

We’re proud to work with Microsoft on building these multi-stake-
holder alliances. Together, we can mobilize the resources to confront 
poverty and close the opportunity gap for the world’s largest-ever 
youth cohort.

Helping youth realize  
their potential 

We’re helping young people realize their  
opportunity in the world by providing access to 
firsthand work experiences and encouraging 
entrepreneurship.

•  Strengthened fundraising opportunities for youth 
by launching Give for Youth, a micro-giving site 
that allows donors to fund and follow the dreams 
of young people worldwide. Give for Youth has 
raised more than $1.4 million for over 600 projects 
through nearly 4,000 donors since its launch  
in 2012. 

•  Helped tech-savvy students launch their careers 

and pursue their dreams by connecting them with 
internships and employment opportunities 
through the Microsoft Students to Business (S2B) 
program. Students in the program benefit from 
access to Microsoft’s global network of partners, 
while participating Microsoft partners can find the 
next generation of young, talented professionals.

•  Assisted young, visionary entrepreneurs in start-
ing their new businesses by providing software, 
support, visibility, and connections to industry 
players and investors through the BizSpark 
program. To date, more than 30,000 startups in 
over 100 countries have graduated from the 
three-year program. The startups have created 
thousands of job opportunities for young people 
and are supported by more than 1,500 BizSpark 
Network Partners.

•  Showcased students on the rise and helped 

them pursue careers in technology through the 
Microsoft Student Partners program. Participants 
conduct demos, build apps, host events, and 
connect with other students, faculty, and industry 
experts, helping them gain valuable experience 
and create networks to improve their job pros-
pects upon graduation.

•  Fostered innovation, entrepreneurship, and 

employability by bringing together students, IT 
professionals, developers, researchers, and 
entrepreneurs at our 100+ Microsoft Innovation 
Centers. The state-of-the-art facilities in 37 
countries are designed to accelerate advances  
in technology and stimulate local software econ-
omies through skills and professional training, 
industry partnerships, and innovation.

Sparking interest in a brighter future 

Jeremy Moore never thought he would go to 
college. The struggling economy in his rural 
Kentucky hometown provided Jeremy with few 
opportunities. But he always loved technology, 
even without formal instruction. “He learned  
what he could on his own, but didn’t really know 
where to go from there,” says Tammy Moore, 
Jeremy’s mother. 

Microsoft founded Technology Education and 
Literacy in Schools (TEALS) to give high school  
students like Jeremy the opportunity to succeed  
in the field of technology. The TEALS program 
trains and mentors high-tech professionals from 
Microsoft and other companies and places them  
in schools as volunteer computer science teachers. 
The program’s team-teaching model also trains 
existing school faculty, so they can continue  
teaching the courses on their own. 

Jeremy now learns about computers and computer 
programming every day. “TEALS has been a 
godsend to us,” says William Owens, Lee County 
Board of Education chairman. “We couldn’t afford 
the teachers and the program, so Microsoft stepped 
in — and we are very grateful.”

The program has been a huge success so far. What 
started as a one-school, single-volunteer program 
with 12 students now reaches 1,500 students from 
35 schools in seven states. “We wanted to see if  
we could take the successes we had locally and make 

a national impact,” says Microsoft Software Engineer 
Isaac Wilson, who teaches Jeremy remotely from 
Redmond, Washington. 

More important, Jeremy made the honor roll for 
the first time ever in the 2012–2013 school year,  
and hopes to attend college and fulfill his dream  
of becoming a software engineer. “TEALS helped 
him all around,” says Tammy. “The sky’s the limit  
for him now.”

“ Office 365 is vital to the work we 
do, which by its nature is cross-
organizational and spans the 
globe. Our Malaria Vaccine 
Initiative is a perfect example, as 
the software lets us collaborate 
across geographies and access 
files no matter where we are in 
the world.”

Erik Arnold, CIO, PATH

Technology helps nonprofits deliver critical services, 
engage new supporters, and raise money faster 
than ever before. We give nonprofits around the 
world access to software and services, providing 
them new opportunities to advance their missions 
and extend their impact.

Donating software and services 
to nonprofits worldwide 

With the right software, nonprofits can provide 
faster, better service and operate more efficiently. 
We donate hundreds of millions of dollars in  
software each year through our Technology for 
Good program. 

•  Increased software donations to 13 percent more 
nonprofits in FY13, empowering 70,286 organi-
zations globally. We now have software donation 
programs in 117 countries around the world.

•  Provided $795 million worth of software to non-
profits around the world — including matched 
donations through our employee giving program. 

•  Launched new software donation programs in 
Austria, Indonesia, and Vietnam through our 
partnership with TechSoup Global.

•  Developed a pilot program to help nonprofits 

implement Microsoft Office 365, a cloud-based 
software solution that provides email, productivity, 
and collaboration tools in the familiar Microsoft 
Office format. We will launch the full Office 365 for 
Nonprofits program in FY14.

Technology in the new nonprofit environment

The environment in which nonprofits work has changed dramatically. 
Online networks have become central to our lives and work, and 
stakeholders want more involvement in our operations. Seeing tan-
gible results from a nonprofit organization’s efforts now requires two 
things: leading with a network mindset and using measurements to 
learn and continuously improve.

Getting there isn’t easy. On the one hand, nonprofits must operate 
with an awareness of the organization’s networks — both online and 
off — and listen to and cultivate those networks to achieve impact. 
Technology can play an important role in helping nonprofits achieve 
this network mindset by helping them accurately measure data and 
apply it to their decision-making processes. 

At the same time, nonprofits must avoid “shiny object” syndrome, in 
which they embrace the newest cool technology tool without consid-
ering strategy, adoption, and transformative use.

Microsoft is well aware of this potential dilemma. In addition to 
donating software and hardware to nonprofits around the world, 
Microsoft provides training and information resources to help non-
profits leverage the transformative power of technology for good. 
Armed with the right tools and knowledge, nonprofits can better 
engage with internal and external stakeholders and create an organi-
zational environment that embraces openness, transparency, and 
collective decision making. 

Helping nonprofits take incremental steps to absorb new technolo-
gies is core to Microsoft’s capacity-building efforts — and is playing a 
major role in helping nonprofits advance their missions and extend 
their impact worldwide.

We provide ways for nonprofits and individuals to 
use technology to tackle the world’s most pressing 
social problems. 

•  Made it easier for people to connect to friends 

and family during disasters through our 
HelpBridge mobile app. Supported by Windows 
Azure, the app also helps people quickly identify 
disaster relief organizations that need financial 
and volunteer support. 

•  Launched the Windows 8 Apps for Social Good 
contest, which encourages developers to create 
apps that have a positive impact on the world 
around them. FY13 winners included an app that 
helps users locate medicine at a reduced cost, and 
an app that combats obesity by informing users 
how to prepare nutritious, healthy meals at home. 

•  Encouraged students to develop solutions to 
real social issues with the Imagine Cup Grant 
program — a three-year, $3 million competitive 
program that awards cash, software, and access 
to resources to a select number of Imagine Cup 
worldwide finalists. Team Graphmasters, one of 
this year’s winners, created a traffic navigation 
system that reduces vehicle carbon emissions, 
fuel costs, and traffic jams by intelligently routing 
vehicles based on traffic and weather conditions.

Help made simple

Reaching out to family and friends is typically the 
first instinct during a crisis. The second is figuring 
out how to help. But in the chaotic aftermath of a 
natural disaster, it’s hard to know where to start. 

James Rooney stripped away the frustration and 
made it simple to do both — all from a single mobile 
app. James, Microsoft’s Technology for Good 
program manager, led the team that developed 
HelpBridge, an app that allows disaster victims to 
communicate quickly and easily with loved ones 
while also connecting citizens with opportunities  
to help. “Microsoft has a long history with disaster 
response and relief efforts,” says James. “We 
wanted to come up with a new solution to easily 
help those in need by leveraging the technologies 
people use every day.” 

While designing HelpBridge, James and his team 
focused on how people like to communicate today. 
The app allows users to alert family and friends  
to their location and condition by sending a pre-
populated message via SMS, Facebook, and email. 
The app makes it just as easy to contribute to relief 
efforts. “People can choose to give money, volun-
teer time, or donate goods from a list of needed 
supplies,” says James. “We try to make it simple.”

HelpBridge has made an impression throughout 
Microsoft. Ben Rudolph, director of Windows Phone 
evangelism at Microsoft, says HelpBridge skillfully 

marries mobile technology with real-world needs. 
“The app gives people the ability to get up and get 
involved in whatever way is best for them,” says  
Ben. “Anyone with a smartphone can download this 
app and easily get involved or get help when they 
need it most.”

Employee giving is a cornerstone of our citizenship 
efforts and an integral part of Microsoft culture.  
In 2013, we celebrated our 30th annual giving cam-
paign and surpassed $1 billion in contributions to 
more than 31,000 nonprofits around the world. The 
success of our employee giving campaign reflects

Partnering for disaster relief

For more than 130 years, the Red Cross has been alleviating human 
suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volun-
teers and the generosity of donors. Innovation and new technologies 
have made communication and disaster response faster — bolstering 
our efforts to ensure people are safe, informed, and connected.  
Our partnership with Microsoft shows how technology combined with 
compassion helps save lives.

When Hurricane Sandy struck in October 2012, Microsoft’s employee 
giving campaign helped us provide immediate relief and assist local 
families in rebuilding their lives. When tornadoes hit the Oklahoma City 
area in May 2013, Microsoft’s donations of electronic equipment to  
our evacuation centers — along with Skype access — helped displaced 
residents register for assistance and reconnect with loved ones. 

Microsoft continues to support our disaster relief activities across the 
country, and we’ve worked together to create an efficient disaster 
volunteer force through the Ready When the Time Comes program. 
Beginning in Redmond, Washington, and now offered nationwide, 
the program trains employees on disaster response and mobilizes 
them as a local skilled-volunteer force when disaster strikes. 

Microsoft and its employees are remarkable examples of how the 
power of partnerships has strengthened the Red Cross and supported 
the people we serve. Their commitment to our humanitarian mission 
helps ensure the Red Cross will be there to deliver care, shelter, and 
hope to people in their times of need.

Gail J. McGovern, CEO
American Red Cross

The American Red Cross exists to provide 
compassionate care to those in need.  
It focuses on several key service areas 
including disaster response and health  
and safety services.

FY13 performance highlights 

FY14 commitments

• Continuing to expand and enhance our employee programs 

to excite and encourage record levels of employee and 
alumni giving and volunteering

• Sharing our technology with other corporations, and  

working with leaders to help scale giving and skills-based 
volunteering

Goal: Make it easier for employees and Microsoft  
alumni to contribute their skills and expertise to local 
communities. 
We registered more than 5,000 new employees on Volunteer 
Manager and extended the program to Microsoft alumni, 
helping them find volunteer opportunities that match their 
skill set. We also encouraged alumni to participate in the 
Puget Sound Day of Caring by offering to match their volun-
teer hours for the day with a donation of $25,000. 

Goal: Support our employees’ giving and volunteerism 
activities worldwide.
We raised awareness and funds for charities worldwide through 
the 24-Hour Global Give and Go, a fundraising activity in which 
Microsoft employees raise funds for an hour before passing  
the torch to employees in a different time zone. We also shared 
tools and best practices for donating time or money from our 
U.S.-based offices to help international giving initiatives.

Goal: Champion volunteerism and assist the industry  
to advance and better adopt skills-based volunteering.
We supported the Taproot Foundation, which brings 
together industry leaders to define a common language  
for skills-based volunteerism. We also created a program  
to tie specific employee skills to related opportunities in  
community organizations.

Humanitarian response
When disaster strikes, every minute counts. Relief agencies rely on quick, 
accurate communications to help people and businesses get back to 
normal as quickly as possible. Our technology helps organizations keep 
vital information flowing during emergencies.

When Hurricane Sandy hit the U.S. mainland in 
October 2012 — destroying thousands of homes 
and leaving millions without power — the Microsoft 
Disaster Response team was ready. 

As the hurricane was still gathering momentum over 
the Atlantic Ocean, the team deployed Microsoft 
ReadyReach, a cloud-based information portal that 
uses Windows Azure to help emergency-manage-
ment agencies and relief workers rapidly coordinate 
response efforts. 

In addition to offering cloud-based maps that show 
the impact of a disaster in real time, the portal makes 
use of social media to communicate information to 
disaster victims about shelters, aid, and safe driving 
routes. It also makes it easier for people to connect 
with humanitarian relief agencies in the area in need 
of money, food, or volunteers. The portal received a 
record 32,766 views during Hurricane Sandy.

The ReadyReach response portal is one of many 
ways the Microsoft Disaster Response team uses 
technology to keep vital information flowing during

emergencies — both individually and in tandem 
with leading humanitarian response organizations 
and technology partners. 

Microsoft also provided a safe location for people 
to store their family emergency response plans or 
insurance policies through SkyDrive for Windows 
or Mac — accessible from any PC or smartphone. 

In addition, in partnership with Aidmatrix, the team 
launched the Notes from the Ground program in late 
2012. This web portal delivers eyewitness responder 
stories to readers via photos, videos, and messages, 
helping increase awareness of conditions on the 
ground and rally community support.

“ Technology is rapidly changing 
the way we respond to disas-
ters — allowing us to shift from a 
top-down driven response to a 
survivor-centric response. 
Microsoft has played a leading 
role in helping response organi-
zations like ours and survivors 
navigate this shift through tech-
nology solutions like HelpBridge 
and SharePoint. Their expertise 
and experience working with 
large organizations have made 
them an ideal partner.”

“ We envision a future where  
technology serves people of all 
abilities — no matter how 
different their needs. The goal of 
creating equal access to tech-
nology lies at the heart of 
Microsoft innovations.”

Rob Sinclair, Chief Accessibility Officer

Technology empowers people — including seniors, 
people with disabilities, and youth — to participate 
at the centers of social and political life. We embed 
accessibility features into our web services, soft-
ware, and hardware, and we partner with others to 
advance important causes, helping our customers 
do more with their talents and interests.

Expanding opportunity for 
people with disabilities

For people with disabilities or hearing and vision 
impairments, accessible technologies can eliminate 
obstacles and broaden opportunities. We strive  
to build accessibility into many of our products and 
services, provide resources that open new doors, 
and partner with others to discover ways of using 
technology to improve lives. 

•  Took a leadership role on accessibility by support-
ing the formation of the International Association 
of Accessibility Professionals. This group will 
provide the strategic leadership, international 
perspective, and operational focus needed to 
globally elevate the accessibility profession and 
build a worldwide infrastructure for accessible 
technology development.

•  Worked with UN Human Rights to strengthen 

provisions in the International Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Supported by  
a study conducted in collaboration with Middlesex 
University and others, the new provisions also 
suggest ways that the United Nations could 
improve its own accessibility.

•  Helped address the needs of people with autism 
by sponsoring and hosting Hack Autism in March 
2013. Supported by the Bing Fund, the hackathon 
brought people together — thinkers, hackers, 
designers — to develop scenario-specific proto-
types to help advance knowledge and develop 
solutions.

•  Provided assistance to customers with disabilities

•  Explored how Kinect for Xbox 360 could unlock 

ways for people who use sign language to interact

Sounds that unlock the world

Amos Miller was thrilled. As a managing architect 
for Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) in the 
United Kingdom, Miller — who is blind — had just 
confirmed that his proof-of-concept innovations 
for people with visual impairments had succeeded. 
He had conceived a whole new way to interact with 
his surroundings.

“It’s easy to overlook the level of anxiety blind 
people face each time they start thinking about  
a trip outside,” Miller noted. “Has the bus stop 
moved? Is there construction along the way?”

Miller’s 3-D Soundscape helps people with visual 
impairments overcome their anxiety and move 
about on their own by emitting audio beacons 
from destinations around town. Rather than  
a voice saying “Starbucks 20 steps ahead on the 
left,” the 3-D Soundscape sends an audio cue from 
the actual location to create a more meaningful  
360-degree world.

“If you have someone talking in your head, then 
your focus is on the voice, not the environment,” 
Miller says. “We tried to create a solution that puts 
users in control of the experience and helps them 
focus on their environment.”

Miller’s team also designed the Windows 8 UX  
app, which allows people to use voice and natural 
gestures such as swiping, tapping, and scrolling to 
understand and interact with information appear-
ing on their screen — without using their eyes. 

Jarnail Chudge, user experience architect with MCS, 
said Miller was the guide and inspiration for the 
project, which also brought in collaborators from 
Bing, Microsoft Research, and the Developer and 
Platform Evangelism Division. “The sheer delight on 
his face when he tested the products was enough 
for everyone on the team to understand we had 
made a real difference.”

Improving wellness for seniors

Older adults can live more independent and produc-
tive lives with the help of innovative technologies. 
We partner with community groups and local  
governments to promote the use of technologies 
that reduce social isolation, increase wellness, and 
enhance the quality of life for seniors.

•  Broadened our effort to help seniors get fit, 
socialize, and manage their personal health 
online with the Exergamers Wellness Club.  
The program — which employs Microsoft Kinect 
for Xbox 360, Xbox LIVE, and Microsoft 
HealthVault — is now offered to senior centers 
throughout Los Angeles. Participants can take 
part in friendly video-game competitions while 
also uploading and tracking important health 
data, such as blood pressure and glucose  
readings, through their online profiles. 

•  Launched a new Exergamers program in New 
York City in collaboration with New York City’s 
Department for the Aging and Department of 
Information Technology & Telecommunications. 
The fitness program is part of the city’s Innovative 
Senior Centers project, a citywide effort to 
encourage better fitness and wellness among 
New York City’s older adults. 

•  Received an innovation award for senior pro-

gramming from the National Association of Area 
Agencies on Aging (n4a), the leading voice on 
aging issues. The award recognized our success 
with the Exergamers Wellness Club, which  
we developed in collaboration with the City  
of Los Angeles Department of Aging.

Working Responsibly / Our people

“ A great company starts with great 
people. Our priority is to leverage 
the diverse perspectives of our 
people to deliver the inventions 
that the world needs, to create 
the devices that the world wants, 
and to offer the services that the 
world requires.” 

Lisa Brummel, Executive Vice President,  
Human Resources

Our employees are innovators from every corner of 
the globe. They bring talent, commitment, and 
diverse life experiences that help us better under-
stand customer needs and deliver exceptional 
products. We invest in each individual by creating 
opportunities for them to grow professionally, and 
we reward their results. We also ask for — and act 
on — employee feedback in search of new ways to 
continually advance our status as one of the best 
places to work in the world.

Compensation and benefits

We attract the world’s best talent through competi-
tive compensation, benefits, and rewards, all of 
which contribute to a world-class work environment 
that motivates great people to do great work. Many 
of our benefits programs are managed at a local 
level to ensure they are competitive locally and meet 
the varying interests and needs of our employees 
around the world.

•  Continued to provide U.S. health care benefits 
that rank among the best in the industry —  
furthering our long-standing commitment of 
providing the highest-quality care for our 
employees and their families.

 - Contributed up to $3,750 per employee (based 
on dependents) to health savings accounts, 
which provide employees with tax-advantaged 
savings for current or future health care needs.

Diversity and inclusion

Our collaborative energy is fueled by diverse talent 
working together in an inclusive way. We foster a 
culture where leaders use the diverse perspectives 
and backgrounds of our employees to pioneer 
inventions, products, and services for our customers.

Representation: Building a diverse pipeline  
of leaders 

•  Added important new voices to Microsoft’s high-

level decision making by increasing the number of 
senior executive women who report to the CEO 
from one to four.

•  Raised the percentage of women and U.S. 

minorities on the Microsoft board of directors 
from 27 percent to 33 percent. 

•  Grew the percentage of minorities in our overall 
U.S. workforce from 36 percent to 38 percent. 

Inclusion: Creating and maximizing  
employee engagement 

•  Completed a maturity model assessment across 
approximately 95 percent of our business groups 
to help us evaluate current diversity and inclusion 
engagement, measure successes, and define 
steps for future growth. Nearly 500 key stake-
holders from 44 organizations have completed 
the model since January 2012. 

•  Incorporated a Global Diversity and Inclusion 

Leader Commitment in the business objectives for 
more than 2,300 Microsoft leaders — making it the 
first CEO-led action of its kind. The commitment 

helps ensure that people and talent development 
processes are prioritized and integrated into our 
business approach. 

•  Trained 16,908 employees on diversity  

and inclusion globally, including more than  
2,400 managers.

•  Ranked number 44 out of nearly 900 companies 
surveyed on DiversityInc magazine’s Top 50 U.S. 
companies list for 2013. Microsoft ranked number 
4 as the top company for Asian-Americans  
and number 9 as the top company for people 
with disabilities.

•  Scored 100% on the Human Rights Campaign 
Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for the 
ninth consecutive year. The CEI provides an in-
depth analysis and rating of corporate policies 
and practices related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
and transgender employees.

Market innovation: Delivering greater business 
value to our customers

We also incorporate diversity and inclusion into our 
business strategy by developing innovative prod-
ucts and services to better serve the needs of a 
broad range of customers. For example, our Native 
American Employee Network and a Cherokee 
Nation team joined forces to add the Cherokee 
language to Microsoft Office 2013 and the 
Language Interface Pack for Windows 8.

•  Arranged 1,656 employee enrollments in FY13  

in 36 safety training courses. 

•  Logged an overall recordable incident rate (RIR) 
of 0.11 per 100 employees — compared with the 
national average of 0.3 for software companies. 
The RIR reflects the number of injury cases 
requiring medical treatment beyond basic first 
aid in a calendar year.

•  Promoted better safety practices and strength-

ened our internal safety culture by adding three 
health and safety programs to our existing 
Employee Safety and Health Manual.

•  Scored a 0.01 rating for occupational injury cases 
that resulted in employee days lost, restricted,  
or transferred, compared with the U.S. software 
industry average of 0.1. The rate is based on the 
number of injury cases per 100 employees in a 
calendar year.

•  Completed baseline health and safety risk 

assessment immediately upon acquiring our new 
Perceptive Pixel manufacturing facility, helping 
ensure compliance with Microsoft health and

Employees around the world creating 
opportunities for others

Approximately 80 percent of Kenyans don’t have 
access to the Internet. The majority don’t even have 
electricity. Fortunately, the potential to transform 
lives in Africa — home to six of the 10 fastest- 
growing economies in the world — has never been 
more promising. 

“We are helping millions of people improve their 
quality of life by giving them opportunities they 
wouldn’t have had before,” says Peter Henderson, 
chairman of Kenyan Internet service provider 
Indigo Telecom.

Peter is a key player in the Mawingu White Spaces 
Broadband Project — an initiative to deliver low-cost, 
high-speed wireless broadband to Kenya. A part-
nership between Microsoft, the Kenyan Ministry of 
Information Communications and Technology, and 
Indigo Telecom, the pilot project services areas 
previously lacking even basic electricity through 
the deployment of combined solar-powered  
stations and TV “white space” frequencies. The 
technology —  partially developed by Microsoft 
Research — relies on unused channels in the 
analog TV spectrum to provide broadband access 
and power to the communities.

The Mawingu project is part of Microsoft’s 4Afrika 
Initiative, an ambitious program developed by  
the Microsoft Africa team and U.S.-based African 
Microsoft employees to boost Africa’s global com-
petitiveness. 4Afrika also helps Microsoft realize its 
global commitment to empowering youth —  
known as YouthSpark — through initiatives like a 

scholarship program for promising African stu-
dents and “AppFactories” in South Africa and Egypt 
that hire paid student interns to develop locally 
relevant apps.

Participants like Bitange Ndemo say Mawingu and 
4Afrika will help create new opportunities for  
commerce, education, health care, and delivery  
of government services across the country.

“We’re beginning to partner with the rest of the 
world simply by accessing knowledge,” says 
Bitange, permanent secretary of the Ministry  
of Information Communications and Technology  
in the Republic of Kenya.

Making our operations  
carbon neutral

Climate change presents serious global challenges 
that require bold responses. With our commitment 
to carbon neutrality, we’re taking accountability  
for the impact of our operations by embedding 
sustainability into all of our business decisions.

Our approach to carbon neutrality  
has three pillars.

“ We instituted a carbon fee last year 
because it had the potential to ignite 
a culture change, and that’s exactly 
what’s starting to happen. A carbon 
price means that we now have a 
common language for how to drive 
awareness around and begin to 
reduce emissions. It’s made environ-
mental sustainability an increasingly 
important part of how Microsoft 
does business.” 

Rob Bernard, Chief Environmental Strategist

Be lean 

Be green

Be accountable

We’re setting targets to improve 
energy efficiency in our data 
centers, labs, and offices, as well 
as reduce our use of air travel.

We’re purchasing more renew-
able energy and establishing 
goals to reduce our waste and 
water use.

We’re measuring the carbon 
impact of our operations and 
charging our business groups a 
fee for their associated carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Be lean: Driving energy savings internally

Being efficient in our operations is fundamental to 
our sustainability goals. We’re implementing new 
technologies to reduce energy and water use 
throughout Microsoft, while encouraging employ-
ees to choose more sustainable behaviors.

•  Reduced resource use with data centers that use 
half the energy and between 1 to 3 percent of 
the water required to cool traditional data 
centers. We’re also tightly integrating resilient 
software across our cloud services to better 
manage the data centers, networks, and services 
hosted within them — helping reduce energy 
consumption and making them increasingly flex-
ible and reliable.

•  Realized energy savings for our data center in 
Dublin, Ireland, by implementing adiabatic 
cooling, which reduces our energy costs per 
megawatt by up to 30 percent. We’re also retro-
fitting existing data centers to be more efficient 
with harder-working, lower-energy servers, com-
pressor energy reduction, custom light-emitting 
diode (LED) lighting, and more. 

•  Dramatically increased insight into our energy use 
at our 125-building, 500-acre Redmond campus 
as part of our Energy-Smart Buildings (ESB) initia-
tive, helping us cut energy costs by an estimated 6 
to 10 percent. An interconnected energy-man-
agement system identifies savings opportunities 
by collecting 500 million data transactions from 
30,000 pieces of equipment per day.

•  Reduced our carbon footprint by increasing our 
use of Microsoft collaboration technology as an 
alternative to travel. We have tools within our 
corporate travel reservation site that encourage 
employees to carefully evaluate the business 
benefit and environmental impact of travel. Since 
2007, we’ve reduced our carbon footprint from 
air travel by 30,000 metric tons.

•  Expanded The Connector, Microsoft’s free com-
muter bus service for employees at our global 
headquarters in Washington state’s Puget Sound 
region to 22 routes, 74 buses, and 700,000 
annual rides. The service has helped eliminate 
46.3 million miles of travel and reduced carbon 
emissions by 19,936 metric tons since its debut 
five years ago.

Learn how we achieved our carbon neutrality goals  
through our Be Lean + Be Green + Be Accountable strategy.

Becoming more efficient

At Microsoft, we’re taking it one step further. By committing to carbon neutrality  
and putting a price on carbon, we are holding ourselves accountable,  
changing our behaviors, and managing the resources we use. By implementing  
our Be Lean + Be Green + Be Accountable = Carbon Neutral strategy, we’re  
changing how we make choices throughout the company.

Be green: More renewable energy, less waste 

Using resources efficiently requires both commit-
ment and investment. We’ve increased our 
purchase of green energy while making respon-
sible choices with our energy, waste, and water.

•  More than doubled our investment in renewable 
energy in FY13 by purchasing 2.3 billion kWh of 
green power globally.

•  Recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) as the second largest purchaser of 
green energy in the United States. Our totals 
increased nearly 70 percent from last year, and 
were equivalent to the energy consumed by 
204,000 average American homes. 

•  Offset more than 300,000 metric tons of CO2 
emissions through a growing portfolio of  
innovative carbon-offset projects.

•  Invested $5.5 million in a demonstration project 
to power a data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, 
using biogas from a wastewater treatment facility, 
providing ultra-clean, carbon-neutral electricity. 
Known as the Data Plant, it will be completely 
independent of the grid and will sustainably 
power cloud services.

•  Helped Turkey put nearly 465,000 megawatt 

hours of clean electricity back into its national 
power grid by investing in the 119 wind turbines 
of the Soma Wind Farm in the Manisa and 
Balikesir provinces. 

•  Reduced, reused, or recycled 99 percent of the 
waste from our Redmond dining facilities by 
switching to compostable tableware, administer-
ing aggressive recycling programs, and adapting 
our menu to get the most from each item of 
food served.

Sustainable water use

Our latest air-cooled data centers in Iowa, 
Ireland, Virginia, and Washington use  
only 1 to 3 percent of the water required  
for a traditional data center, and produce  
no wastewater.

Be accountable: Holding ourselves  

to a new standard

A critical aspect of addressing climate change is 
holding ourselves accountable. For the first time 
ever, we’ve integrated carbon use into the financial 
decision making of the company. Our internal 
carbon fee builds a more responsible corporate 
culture while giving us a new perspective on the 
external costs of our emissions. 

•  Held every business group at Microsoft respon-
sible for their emissions with our internal carbon 
fee — the cornerstone of our commitment to 
carbon neutrality. Using technologies to measure 
the impact of our operations, we charge our 
business groups according to their actual carbon 
impact, from electricity use to air travel. This 
adds discipline to our business decisions and 
helps guide the resource choices made both at 
our corporate headquarters and through our 
local subsidiaries. 

•  Created an internal investment fund for our 

carbon fee payments. The fund will be used to 
support a variety of energy-efficiency and car-
bon-offset projects, helping us reduce net 
emissions and meet our carbon neutrality goal.

•  Improved transparency by measuring emissions 
with advanced tracking software. We rolled out 
the cloud-based CarbonSystems Enterprise 
Sustainability Platform — based on Microsoft 
technology — to more than 600 facilities  
in 100 countries, providing visibility into our 
energy use and emissions.

Inside the Microsoft carbon fee

How our carbon fee gives business groups an incentive to  
reduce their emissions and helps us achieve carbon neutrality.

A business division 
uses carbon-based 
energy or air travel.

The carbon fee is paid by the 
division based on the amount 
of carbon emissions.

Microsoft invests the 
carbon fund in projects 
to reduce our footprint.

That money goes into 
Microsoft’s carbon fund.

+ Be Green + Be Accountable = Carbon Neutral strategy 
helped us achieve full carbon neutrality in FY13.

Goal: Implement an internal carbon fee that will place  
a price on carbon, based on current market pricing for 
renewable energy and carbon offsets, and make the  
company’s business divisions financially responsible for 
the cost of their carbon emissions.
Our carbon fee established a price for carbon at Microsoft, 
encouraging business groups to account for energy and 
travel consumption in business decisions. 

Goal: Source more renewable power and continue to 
implement our more sustainable data center designs.
We purchased 2.3 billion kWh of renewable energy in FY13 —  
more than double last year’s number — while continuing 
research investments in sustainable energy solutions for our 
data centers and tightly integrating resilient software across 
our cloud. 

Goal: Roll out an energy-management program to decrease 
energy use in the buildings on our Redmond campus.

Developing technologies to  
reduce environmental impact

Information technology accounts for up to 4 percent 
of electricity consumed globally. To keep such power 
use in line, we’re building new efficiencies into our 
products and services to help our customers reduce 
their environmental impact. And as our customers 
and collaborators put their energies into using our 
products, we’re advancing the conversation about 
conservation and climate change mitigation. 

Improving energy efficiency  
in products and services

Much like the cloud has revolutionized business 
efficiency, we’ve transformed how efficient cloud 
storage can be. Through our online products and 
solutions, we’re helping Microsoft users worldwide 
reduce their own energy consumption.

•  Reduced our customers’ environmental impact 
by hosting Microsoft cloud services in our 
advanced, highly efficient data centers. Small 
and medium-size businesses that use Microsoft 
cloud services can reduce their energy use and 
associated carbon emissions by up to 90 percent 
compared with on-premises delivery.

•  Cut PC energy consumption while driving better 
performance through power management fea-
tures built into our hardware and Windows 8.

•  Equipped IT managers to better discover, track, 
and implement potential energy efficiencies  
with centrally managed tools such as Microsoft’s 
System Center Configuration Manager.

•  Helped customers avoid emissions from shipping 
and packaging through our Digital by Choice 
program, which offers digital software distribution 
and dematerializes CD and DVD production.

Power management features in Windows 8  
help cut PC energy consumption.

•  Reduced standby power use for the Xbox 360 by a 
factor of 10 since its launch in 2005. Now using less 
than three-tenths of a watt, the efficiencies have 
resulted in a 60 percent reduction in energy use. 

•  Created a public website and hosted events and 
programs to foster community knowledge in life 
cycle sustainability, particularly the environmental 
choices related to buying, using, and disposing 
of electronics.

•  Enabled our sales teams and encouraged partners 
to highlight green product offerings by flagging 
more efficient products and holding EPEAT® 
training courses in Central and Eastern Europe. 
EPEAT is a comprehensive environmental rating 
system that helps identify environmentally pref-
erable electronics.

Reducing life cycle impact

Environmental sustainability is core to our hardware 
design and manufacturing. As part of our Design 
for Green (DfG) initiative, we’re rethinking how we 
build hardware from the ground up, incorporating 
such environmental criteria as energy efficiency, 
recyclability, materials selection, and power type.

•  Redesigned our products for improved environ-
mental performance. Windows 8, for example, 
makes power management seamless and efficient 
across multiple devices, including laptops, net-
books, desktops, or tablets. We also expanded on 
the significant battery-life improvements made  
in Windows 7 and further developed them in 
Windows 8, such as giving PCs and laptops the 
ability to instantly switch between low- and high-
power modes. 

•  Introduced an environmental scorecard into our 
DfG initiative to evaluate energy efficiency,  
use of recycled or alternate materials, and mini-
mization of packaging earlier in the product 
inception process.

Informing discussions of climate change 

Climate change mitigation requires action and 
understanding. We’re helping collect, study, and 
manage research into the impact of climate  
change to support conservation strategies and 
inform public policy.

•  Advocated for large-scale ecosystem modeling 
through a partnership with the United Nations 
Environment Programme World Conservation 
Monitoring Centre. Microsoft’s Computational 
Ecology and Environmental Science (CEES) group 
and Microsoft Research took on the challenge  
of creating a vast, data-driven General Ecosystem 
Model in hopes of enhancing environmental 
understanding and promoting conservation  
and biodiversity.

•  Worked to restore large aquatic ecosystems — 

particularly in the Puget Sound region — through 
a cooperative project with the U.S. EPA. The 
Microsoft Research Connections team explored 
how available data and technology can help 
build relationships between community 
members, land holders, and decision makers at 
the county and city level.

•  Mapped out threats to endangered wildlife in 
partnership with the International Union for 
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resource’s 
Red List of Threatened Species. Our dedicated 
team of CEES environmental scientists developed 
software built on SQL Server 2012 and Bing Maps 
to strengthen research and create a repository  
of evidence for threats to species.

•  Helped preserve threatened plant and animal 
species in Latin America through LiveANDES, a 
data collection and processing tool developed 
by Microsoft Research in collaboration with the 
Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the 
Latin American and Caribbean Collaborative ICT 
Research Virtual Institute.

Developing technologies to reduce environmental impact

FY13 performance highlights 

FY14 commitments

Goal: Provide guidance to help our industry develop 
more efficient software. 
Many new Windows applications are designed to work in 
concert with Windows Power Management. We also part-
nered with cloud developers to make their code as efficient 
as possible, helping increase data center efficiency.

• Working with cities around the world to leverage IT and 
cloud computing to manage resources such as energy  
and water more efficiently

• Educating customers on how to dispose of old computers 
and devices sustainably through industry partnerships,  
collection programs, and outreach efforts

Goal: Work with partners on customer solutions in five 
key areas: greener IT, buildings, power and energy infra-
structure, transportation, and resource management. 
We launched a smart buildings pilot program in Seattle, 
Washington, modeled after our Redmond Energy-Smart 
Buildings project. The pilot is expected to produce energy 
and management savings between 10 to 25 percent in large 
commercial buildings across Seattle’s downtown corridor. 

Goal: Collaborate with industry peers to develop new 
metrics like Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) and Water 
Usage Effectiveness (WUE) that will help make data  
centers as efficient as possible.
The Green Grid’s proposed CUE and WUE metrics enable 
operators to quickly assess the relative sustainability of  
their data centers and determine if energy-efficiency and/or 
sustainable-energy improvements need to be made.

Goal: Educate customers on how to dispose of old  
computers and devices sustainably through industry 
partnerships, collection programs, and outreach efforts.
Through our Environment website, we help customers find 
Microsoft-supported recycling opportunities in their area. 
We’ve also created the Greener IT Challenge, which is 
designed to help both customers and companies make 
more environmentally responsible choices and better 
understand the impact associated with the purchasing,  
use, and disposal of PCs.

“ We understand the critical interplay 
between technology and human 
rights and our Technology and 
Human Rights Center will focus on 
bringing the power of technology to 
bear in advancing respect for human 
rights while working across Microsoft 
to ensure compliance with our 
Global Human Rights Statement.”

Brad Smith, Executive Vice President and General 
Counsel, Legal and Corporate Affairs

New technologies create new opportunities for 
people to promote and express their human rights. 
Accessing information, supporting worthy causes, 
and organizing protests — to name just a few — are 
now possible on a worldwide scale with the touch 
of a few buttons. But technology can also expose 
people to unwanted privacy risks, exploitation, and 
online safety threats. 

While technology itself doesn’t take sides, technol-
ogy providers can play a powerful role in promoting 
human rights and helping people understand the 
risks and rewards of using technology. We believe 
companies such as Microsoft have a responsibility 
to uphold universally accepted standards of human 
rights and protect people’s privacy — starting with 
the design and manufacturing of our products. 

Our Global Human Rights Statement is a powerful 
beacon for our business — a foundational influence 
for relevant policies and practices. The statement 
lays out a common set of human rights principles 
and helps guide key business decisions in critical 
areas, such as privacy, security, freedom of expres-
sion, labor rights, equality, diversity, and access  
to education.

Working Responsibly / Human rights

Our Global Human Rights Statement focuses on 
four key priorities. 

•  Creating opportunity: Our products, services, 
and devices bring the power of technology to 
promote respect for human rights and help 
shape the human rights agendas of governments 
and business.

•  Acting globally: Our commitment is based on 

internationally recognized standards and respect 
for all human rights, including civil, political,  
economic, social, and cultural rights. 

•  Engaging strategically: We believe our business 
can most effectively respect human rights 
through our presence in, rather than absence 
from, countries that present significant human 
rights risks.

•  Promoting good governance: We will continue 

to model and promote the rule of law and good 
governance around the world.

We’re also committed to meeting our human rights 
responsibilities across our global supply chain and 
employee community. Read more in Responsible 
sourcing and Our people.

The power of technology  
to promote human rights

We believe technology should help people achieve 
their full potential in accordance with fundamental 
human rights. In January 2013, we launched the 
Microsoft Technology and Human Rights Center at 
the World Economic Forum 2013 Annual Meeting in 
Davos, Switzerland. A cornerstone of our human 
rights activities, the center will help us further inte-
grate human rights into our culture and throughout 
our operations. We’ll also work through the center 
to advance public understanding of the human 
rights impacts of information and communications 
technology (ICT). 

Our FY13 actions in this area encompassed two main 
categories: anti-human trafficking and online safety.

Our Global Human Rights 
Statement aligns with:
•   United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles 

on Business and Human Rights

•   UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights

•   UN International Covenant on Civil and 

Political Rights

•   UN International Covenant on Economic, 

Social, and Cultural Rights

Anti-human trafficking 

•  Supported the global fight against human traf-
ficking and helped empower young women to 
become leaders in computer science by sponsor-
ing the International Women’s Hackathon. The 
crowdsourcing event, which involved 395 women 
on 11 university campuses worldwide, was aimed 
at developing technical solutions to advance the 
missions of three nonprofits: FAIR Girls, 
Rights4Girls, and The Hindsight Group. 

•  Advocated increased adoption of anti-child por-
nography tools like Microsoft PhotoDNA, an 
image-matching technology used by leading 
companies, nongovernmental agencies (NGOs), 
and law enforcement agencies to help stop the 
redistribution of the worst-known images of child 
sexual exploitation online.

•  Partnered with several organizations to combat 
human trafficking through the Internet, including 
the White House Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, the White House Council on Women and 
Girls, several U.S. state attorneys general, the UN 
Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, and 
local police agencies. 

 - Informed California’s report “The State of 

Human Trafficking in California 2012,” in part-
nership with the office of California Attorney 
General Kamala Harris. Released in November 
2012, the report includes information on how 
organizations can use technology to investigate 
and prosecute traffickers and assist victims.

 - Helped fight child exploitation by participating 
in the Thorn Foundation Technology Task 
Force, a cross-industry collaboration that 
focuses on the role technology plays in crimes 
involving child sex trafficking. This year, our 
contributions included helping establish 
industry best practices and guidance on how 
to address the problem of online predators.

Online safety

•  Championed the importance of online safety 

within the ICT industry by naming the industry’s 
first chief online safety officer in March 2013. 

•  Raised awareness of safer online practices and 

educated consumers and families about  
trustworthy online activities by leading or partici-
pating in online safety conferences, events, and 
activities in Australia, Cameroon, Egypt, Ireland, 
the United Kingdom, and several cities across  
the United States. 

•  Took steps to combat online bullying by con-
ducting a worldwide study of negative online 
behaviors among youth in 25 countries. The 
study, which revealed that 54 percent of youth 
are worried they will be bullied online, was 
released in the summer of 2012, in tandem with 
new anti-bullying educational materials for 
parents, educators, and young people. 

•  Promoted a safer online environment for children 
by participating in the European Union’s CEO 
Coalition for Child Online Safety.

Human rights

As a global company, we address important human rights issues every day.

Online  
privacy

Human trafficking

Child online 
safety

Conflict minerals 
and labor rights

Freedom of 
expression

Data 
security

We are guided by four principles to help us make sound business decisions.

The power of technology  
to promote human rights

Technology can empower 
individuals to achieve their 
full potential in accordance 
with fundamental human 
rights.

A global approach

Engagement worldwide

Businesses should be guided 
by internationally recognized 
standards of human rights, 
such as the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and 
Human Rights and the 
Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. 

Businesses can most 
effectively respect human 
rights through their 
presence in — rather than 
absence from — countries 
that pose human rights risks.

Good governance and the 
rule of law

Businesses should respect 
human rights by modeling 
and promoting good 
governance and the rule of 
law around the world.

How we demonstrated our commitment  
to respecting human rights in FY13 

•  Launched the Microsoft Technology and  

•  Continued membership in the Global Network Initiative  

Human Rights Center 

to foster freedom of expression around the world

•  Completed human rights impact assessments on key 
areas of our business and potential global markets

•  Built partnerships and led technology research  
supporting the fight against human trafficking 

•  Released our first-ever Law Enforcement Requests 

Report 

•  Continued advancement of the PhotoDNA software 
program used to combat child pornography online 

•  Created new tools and trainings to advance Microsoft’s 

•  Sponsored the International Women’s Hackathon  

internal integration of human rights policies

to support the fight against human trafficking

Working Responsibly / Human rights

A global approach

We seek to align all aspects of our business with 
internationally recognized human rights standards. 
As an adherent to the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, we join with other 
businesses in embracing universal principles that 
help shape our business strategy and operations. 

Global Network Initiative

The Global Network Initiative (GNI) is an interna-
tional coalition of technology companies, civil 
society organizations, investors, and academics 
dedicated to safeguarding human rights in the  
face of restrictive governments.

•  Demonstrated our ongoing commitment to the 

free exchange of ideas and information under the 
Freedom of Expression policy we adopted in FY11 
as a member of the GNI. The GNI allows us to 
participate in discussions about how to provide 
products and services in the ICT sector in ways 
that respect, protect, and advance freedom of 
expression and privacy — particularly in the face 
of government demands for censorship and dis-
closure of users’ personal information. 

•  Collaborated with the GNI to define the scope 

and method of the next phase of an independent 
assessment of GNI company members. The 
assessment will include third-party reviews of 
selected cases where the government asked 
companies to remove content or demanded user 
information or content, helping the GNI evaluate 
the extent to which company members followed 
its stated policies and procedures.

Impacts, assessments, and best practices

•  Increased internal Microsoft understanding of 
our human rights–related impacts and enabled 
better business decision making by conducting 
human rights impact assessments for Microsoft 
products, services, and potential global markets. 

•  Fostered understanding and adoption of the UN 

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
and shared best practices through proactive 
engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, 
including investors, human rights organizations, 
and other corporations. 

•  Engaged in several third-party forums related to 
human rights, including presentations at the first 
annual UN Forum on Business and Human 
Rights, held in Geneva in December 2012, and 
the Business and Human Rights: Best Practices in 
Supply Chain symposium hosted by the Council 
on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., in  
May 2013.

Engagement

One of the most challenging issues we face is how 
to most effectively advance our values in countries 
that do not share our commitment to human 
rights. We believe active engagement in these 
countries holds the greatest promise for promoting 
human rights in the long term. Read about our 
work with BSR on engaging in emerging markets 
on page 76.

Good governance  
and the rule of law

Responsible business can serve as a model for 
sound human rights practices. More than 10 years 
ago, Bill Gates launched the Trustworthy Computing 
Initiative, a company-wide effort to limit privacy and 
data security risks. This initiative continues to inform 
our internal policies. We also respect the rule of law 
around the world, helping us promote a criminal 
justice and security landscape that prioritizes trans-
parency and fairness for all.

•  Increased the transparency of Microsoft’s data-
handling practices by releasing our first-ever 
Law Enforcement Requests Report. The report 
details the number of data requests we received 
from official legal entities, categorizes them by 
type, and describes the rigor of our review 
process for each request. 

•  Continued embedding awareness of human rights 
issues into our company culture and organizations 
by including our Global Human Rights Statement 
in the business ethics and compliance materials we 
send to all employees globally. We also provided 
human rights training to key internal groups.

•  Worked to ensure Microsoft’s commitments to 

freedom of expression are met by requiring train-
ing for software developers, privacy managers, 
product group attorneys, and other field person-
nel who receive requests from governments to 
take down online content.

Human rights due diligence at Microsoft

Faris Natour,  
Director, Human Rights
BSR

Faris leads BSR’s human rights practice, 
advising companies on human rights  
strategy, policy development, human 
rights impact assessments, and other ele-
ments of human rights due diligence.

Over the last two years, BSR has worked with Microsoft to conduct 
human rights due diligence. Our work began with a corporate-wide 
mapping to identify relevant human rights issues, assess how 
Microsoft has been managing these issues, and prioritize Microsoft’s 
operations for more in-depth human rights impact assessments 
(HRIAs). Following this mapping, BSR has conducted HRIAs of various 
products, services, business relationships, and markets. 

BSR’s assessments are aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights and guided by Microsoft’s Global Human 
Rights Statement. Through independent research, internal interviews, 
and external engagement, BSR identified key human rights risks  
and opportunities, and provided conclusions and recommendations 
for Microsoft. 

Among our work in 2013, we conducted a country-level human rights 
impact assessment to inform Microsoft’s decision on whether and 
how to enter a new market. This assessment identified key risks, such 
as the need for more robust “know your customer” due diligence, 
and identified opportunities, such as using technology to strengthen 
civil society organizations in the country. Aligned with Microsoft’s 
belief that it can most effectively respect human rights through its 
presence in — rather than absence from — countries with significant 
human rights risks, the assessment provided Microsoft with a road 
map to engage in the country responsibly.

Throughout the due-diligence process, we collaborate closely with 
Microsoft to merge BSR’s human rights expertise and external per-
spective with Microsoft’s technology expertise and understanding of 
its products, services, and markets. We will continue to conduct 
human rights impact assessments on additional aspects of Microsoft’s 
business and assist Microsoft in addressing our findings.

Privacy and data security

Social networking sites, online communities, and 
other Internet innovations have made it easier than 
ever for people to share ideas and information, but 
they’ve also introduced unprecedented privacy and 
security risks. We continue to pioneer ways to 
protect our customers’ privacy and help keep their 
information secure in the design and development 
of our products. 

Privacy 

•  Upheld our ongoing commitment to customer 
privacy by enabling Do Not Track in Internet 
Explorer 10. Do Not Track gives customers more 
control over how their online activities are 
recorded and used.

•  Increased public awareness of potential online 

privacy risks and educated customers about how 
they can use Microsoft technologies to help  
mitigate these risks through an international 
education campaign. We also released the 
online tool Your Privacy Type to help customers 
better understand their privacy type and align  
it with their online behavior. 

•  Capped a series of worldwide privacy discus-

sions with the Microsoft Global Privacy Summit 
in Redmond in September 2012. Insights from 
the Microsoft Global Privacy Series — which also 
included events in Washington, D.C., Brussels, 
Singapore, Sydney, and Sao Paulo — were pub-
lished in the white paper “Notice and Consent in 
a World of Big Data” by Indiana University and 
the University of Oxford.

•  Delivered the keynote address at the 34th 

International Conference of Data Protection and 
Privacy Commissioners in Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
Brad Smith, executive vice president and general 
counsel, Legal and Corporate Affairs at Microsoft, 
spoke on “Privacy and Technology in Balance.”

•  Continued investing in our privacy governance 
program by employing individuals who have 
formal privacy responsibilities, including many 
certified information privacy professionals. All 
are tasked with helping ensure that privacy poli-
cies are applied across our products, devices, 
and services.

Data and systems security

•  Continued our ongoing commitment to cus-
tomer privacy by enabling Do Not Track in 
Internet Explorer 10. We believe that one day 
it will give consumers the increased control 
over their privacy they expect and deserve. 

•  Advanced public awareness of online risks by 
issuing volume 14 of the Microsoft Security 
Intelligence Report, a comprehensive, up-to- 
date, and geographically specific analysis of the  
cyber-threat landscape — including exploits,  
vulnerabilities, and malware — using data  
from Internet services and more than 600 million 
computers worldwide.

•  Hosted the second Security Development 

Conference in San Francisco, California. The event, 
which attracted more than 270 attendees from  
127 global organizations, showcased our ongoing 
support for the Security Development Lifecycle —  
Microsoft’s security assurance process for software 
development. 

•  Helped software developers and IT professionals 

better understand how installing new applications 
on Windows systems can alter the threat environ-
ment by releasing the Attack Surface Analyzer 1.0. 
The free tool builds awareness of security threats 
by highlighting potential weaknesses.

“ This year, we have focused on 
further integrating responsible 
sourcing into how we manage 
relationships across our broad 
base of suppliers, as part of our

spent with women- and minor-
ity-owned businesses in FY13, 
placing Microsoft in the top 20 
companies for spending with 
diverse suppliers.

Our supplier network is critical to our business. We 
require our suppliers to uphold the ethical business, 
employment, environmental, and worker safety 
practices outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct 
(SCC) — which aligns with the Electronic Industry 
Citizenship Coalition’s (EICC) responsible supply 
chain standards. This year, we enhanced our SCC 
with provisions related to freedom of association 
and human trafficking.

We have two internal teams devoted to administer-
ing our supply chain.

•  Our Global Procurement Group oversees our 
non-hardware suppliers, which number more 
than 60,000. This group runs such responsible 
sourcing initiatives as our supplier diversity 
program, ethics training, and anti-corruption 
screening programs. In FY13, the group created  
a new management function solely dedicated  
to responsible sourcing. 

•  Our Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and 

Information Services Group manages our hard-
ware and packaging supply chain. For the last 
eight years, this group has run a Social and 
Environmental Accountability (SEA) program  
to ensure that our hardware and packaging  
suppliers abide by our SCC and additional pro-
gram-specific requirements. The SEA program 
also helps hardware and packaging suppliers 
enhance their capabilities in areas such as  
waste management and worker-management 
communications.

Hardware and  
packaging production

Beginning with the introduction of the Microsoft 
Mouse in 1982, our hardware business has grown 
steadily — and has accelerated even more in the 
past several years. Our hardware and packaging 
production activities now span 16 countries around 
the world.

As we transition to a devices and services company, 
we have reaffirmed our expectations for hardware 
and packaging production suppliers on issues con-
cerning labor, health and safety, environmental 
controls, business ethics, and management systems. 
As we work with an increasingly large and complex 
set of hardware and packaging production 

suppliers, we are continuing to raise the bar with our 
existing suppliers while onboarding new suppliers to 
our requirements. 

We also recognize the increasing level of public 
interest in our supply chain management practices, 
and are therefore expanding the scope of informa-
tion in this report. Earlier this year, we disclosed  
our top 100 hardware production suppliers.

Our approach to supplier engagement

Our hardware and packaging suppliers are 
required by contract to follow Microsoft’s social 
and environmental specifications, which include 
our SCC and other criteria specific to hardware  
and packaging production. These requirements 
apply to the following two tiers of suppliers.

•  Tier 1 suppliers have a direct contractual  

relationship with Microsoft to manufacture  
our hardware components and products. 

•  Tier 2 suppliers are contracted by Microsoft  

to provide components and/or materials to our 
Tier 1 suppliers for inclusion in our products. 

We also require these suppliers to have systems in 
place to ensure that their own upstream suppli-
ers —  those that Microsoft does not contract with 
directly — conform to our SEA specifications. 

“As we pivot to a devices and 
services business, we aim to set a 
high bar for ourselves and our 
suppliers on ethics, labor rights, 
health and safety, and the 
environment.”

Working Responsibly / Responsible sourcing

All hardware and packaging suppliers contracting 
with Microsoft undergo qualification assessments to 
ensure they meet our standards. Before we start 
doing business together, all Tier 1 and high- and 
medium-risk Tier 2 suppliers face initial capability 
assessments and audits conducted by third-party 
auditors and/or Microsoft’s own SEA team. Once 
these suppliers are on board, we provide a score-
card that grades each factory on our social and 
environmental requirements for hardware and pack-
aging suppliers.

On an ongoing basis, third parties audit our Tier 1 
suppliers at least annually and audit Tier 2 suppliers 
based on their risk level. Microsoft’s SEA team  
supplements these third-party audits with onsite 
assessments of Tier 1 factories and high- and 
medium-risk Tier 2 component suppliers.

Our approach to supplier engagement

Third-party auditors and the Microsoft SEA team 
use protocols and tools developed by the EICC that 
we supplement with additional criteria. Audit criteria 
include labor, health and safety, environment,  
ethics, and management systems. During the review 
process, auditors examine documentation; visit pro-
duction lines, dorms, canteens, and waste storage 
facilities; and conduct face-to-face interviews of 
workers and factory management.

When auditors or our SEA team find non-confor-
mances with our standards, our SEA team works 
closely with suppliers on corrective action plans to 
resolve issues. We require suppliers to identify the 
root cause, the corrective course of action, and 
future preventive actions for all the issues found. 
Suppliers must correct issues within specific dead-
lines based on the severity of the non-conformance 
found to avoid restrictions on new Microsoft busi-
ness or the possibility that we’ll terminate our 
business with them.

We also conduct additional inspections of suppliers 
when audits have identified a considerable number 
of repeated non-conformances and/or critical/
serious non-conformances. These factory inspec-
tions include visits from Microsoft executives in 
conjunction with SEA team members, and require 
good faith efforts to address major findings. 
Suppliers that do not address our findings risk  
termination of business.

While we demand accountability, we seek to work 
collaboratively to help our contracted suppliers 
build their capabilities by sharing experiences and 
best practices, including detailed guidelines on 
how to improve factory workers’ living environments 
and communities.

Supplier Code  
of Conduct
The SCC sets our expectations for ethical 
business and employment practices 
among all companies doing business with 
Microsoft, including overseas suppliers and 
service providers. Our SCC requires, among 
other things:

•   Fair, legal wages under  
humane conditions

•   A safe and healthy work environment

•   A workplace free of harassment,  

discrimination, or abuse

•   Freedom of association

•   No forced or child labor and new  

protections against human trafficking

•   Environmental and  

regulatory compliance

•   Business, legal, and  

anti-corruption protections

Ensuring supplier accountability 

In FY13, we completed 278 third-party audits and 
Microsoft assessments of 149 Tier 1 and high- and 
medium-risk Tier 2 suppliers, up from 267 third-party 
audits and Microsoft assessments of 120 Tier 1 and 2 
suppliers in FY12.

Last year, we disclosed in our Citizenship Report 
the critical/serious non-conformances from labor-
related violations. In this year’s report, we are 
building on that disclosure by reporting on critical/
serious non-conformances for the broader range 
of labor, health and safety, environment, and ethics 
requirements covered in third-party audits and 
Microsoft assessments of suppliers. 

All of the identified critical/serious non-confor-
mances were escalated to Microsoft senior 
management, and the suppliers were placed on 
restricted status with no new Microsoft business 
awarded until they had resolved these issues. In all 
these instances, the supplier instituted a corrective 
action plan that was approved by Microsoft — with 
follow-up audits confirming that the supplier was 
implementing the corrective action. As we do each 
year, we analyzed patterns of these non-confor-
mances to improve our supplier capability-building 
and compliance-training efforts for the next year.

As the charts indicate, the number of audits and 
assessments conducted year over year increased 
primarily due to the onboarding of new suppliers; 
however, the total number of critical/serious labor 
non-conformances decreased. 

Microsoft 2013 Citizenship Report

Over the past two years, we’ve found four instances 
of underage workers in our suppliers’ factories due 
to vulnerabilities in the suppliers’ age-verification 
procedure. Suppliers did not detect the misuse of 
borrowed identification indicating the employee 
was older than he or she in fact was. To address this 
issue, we’ve worked to help suppliers implement 
facial-recognition software to screen new employees. 
This substantially reduces the risk of minors misus-
ing legitimate identification papers to get work. A 
number of our suppliers now take this additional 
step to validate potential employees’ ages. In the 
four instances over the past two years where we 
found an underage worker in a factory, we worked 
with the supplier to ensure they provided the indi-
vidual full compensation for their work and a safe 
journey back home.

Supporting women’s empowerment and health

Racheal Meiers, Director
HERproject

Racheal oversees the HERproject Factory 
and HERproject Farm programs, along 
with the global HERproject team. She also 
supervises relationships with participating 
companies, and manages program media 
relations, partnerships, and expansion.

Women working in factories face a number of personal health risks 
and challenges, which are often aggravated by gender inequities  
that impact their lives at home and in their communities. Not being 
able to practice preventive general and reproductive health —  
whether due to lack of awareness or reluctance to seek health  
services — negatively impacts the personal well-being of women,  
as well as their ability to thrive as employees.

BSR’s HERproject (Health Enables Returns) works to address this  
challenge through factory-based women’s health education, using  
a peer education methodology that also drives empowerment and 
leadership development. Across nine countries in Asia and Africa, 
HERproject motivates factory workers to become health ambassa-
dors to their coworkers, their families, and within their communities, 
training individuals on issues like safe sex and HIV/AIDS, nutrition, 
cervical cancer and breast cancer, and general health and hygiene. 
The HERproject also works to demonstrate the business benefits  
of these program activities to promote long-term factory investments 
in women’s health. 

Microsoft and two key suppliers have participated in the HERproject 
over the past three years. Our collaboration has helped reach more 
than 5,000 women working in southern China, as well as sensitizing 
6,000 male workers to these issues. Follow-up surveys indicate the 
program has raised awareness of important health issues, but more 
important, the program has promoted adoption of healthier behaviors. 

Microsoft is one of only two electronics companies participating in the 
HERproject (out of 24 company partners). The company’s involvement 
is an important factor in driving increased attention to and support  
for women’s health and well-being — and women’s empowerment 
more broadly — within the electronics industry.

Improving work and living conditions

In FY13, Microsoft’s SEA team and manufacturing 
and sourcing teams gathered input from workers 
and suppliers to create a “model factory” scorecard 
that we now use with all our Tier 1 suppliers. The 
scorecard has the following five categories:

•  Compliance: Scores based on third-party audits 

and Microsoft SEA team assessments

•  Living conditions: Scores from Microsoft’s com-
prehensive living condition checklist of required 
practices, such as food quality, dorm cleanliness, 
and recreational facilities and activities

•  Training and career development: Scores from 
suppliers’ rollout of required employee classes 
for life skills, ranging from IT training to financial 
planning and career development courses

•  Environmental, health and safety key perfor-

mance indicators: Scores of injury and illness rates 
and recordable incidences of fire, chemical spills, 
environmental violations, and greenhouse gases

•  Communication and transparency: Scores of 

suppliers’ transparency in publishing an annual 
corporate social responsibility report, and 
implementing worker-management communi-
cation programs and worker-grievance 
reporting programs

Our efforts to improve working and living conditions 
are guided by input from workers. For the third 
year in a row, we conducted anonymous worker 
surveys through the Fair Labor Association, helping 
to address worker concerns at our suppliers. This 
included interviews with more than 2,000 workers 
making Microsoft products. The findings reveal 
that we made progress in several areas. 

•  Improved worker awareness of factory rules and 
regulations among our hardware and packaging 
suppliers, with 92 percent reporting they under-
stood their respective factory rules in FY13, 
compared with 75 percent in FY11.

•  Increased average worker satisfaction with work 
conditions from 60 percent in the FY11 survey  
to 76 percent in FY13. Worker satisfaction with 
workplace health and safety increased from  
62 to 77 percent.

•  Improved satisfaction with working hours, with  

60 percent of workers stating their working hours 
are reasonable, and an average of 18 percent 
desiring to work even longer hours. Survey results 
in FY13 showed marked improvement from FY11, 
when less than half of survey participants stated 
their working hours were reasonable.

Although good progress has been made, the survey 
results also identified areas for improvement, includ-
ing compensation; dining conditions related to food 
variety, taste, and price; enhanced communications 
between factory management and workers; and 
more educational opportunities for career develop-
ment and personal improvement.

Promoting a safe working environment

Health and safety is a top priority for Microsoft. We 
believe that individuals should be able to work and 
return safely home each night with no negative 
impact to their health and well-being. Building on 
the strong foundation put in place in FY11 and FY12, 
we continued to work with suppliers to ensure that 
working environments are safe and healthy.

•  Conducted in-depth environmental health and 
safety assessments at all Tier 1 and some high-
risk Tier 2 suppliers, helping us proactively 
identify areas of high risk within our supplier 
facilities, such as electroplating and soldering 
operations and the handling of hazardous 
chemicals. We then helped our suppliers imple-
ment best practices to mitigate health and safety 
risks by providing safety guidelines, and suggested 
metrics for monitoring performance and training 
on recommended practices. 

Improving  
women’s health
11,041 women in our supplier workplaces 
were trained on reproduction, sexually 
transmitted diseases, and other health 
issues through our partnership with  
BSR’s HERproject.

•  Expanded our training and capability-building 
work with suppliers to foster safe working 
conditions.

 - Partnered with BSR on HERproject (Health 

Enables Returns) to educate women on such 
health issues as reproduction, sexually trans-
mitted diseases, and human immunodeficiency 
virus. This year, the project reached 11,041 
workers for a total of 22,082 training hours. 
The program increased health awareness by  
26 percent and adoption of healthier behaviors 
by 60 percent.

 - Promoted and raised awareness of safer 

working conditions at a key supplier site in 
China through our collaboration with the Hong 
Kong Workers’ Health Centre. Through this 
partnership, 1,831 workers received training, we 
established a new onsite safety committee, and 
the factory addressed 223 environmental 
health and safety suggestions from workers.

Conflict minerals

Strong collaboration is the key to establishing an 
industrywide, conflict minerals–free electronics 
supply chain — a broad effort we’ve been behind 
since 2007. We took a stand on this issue well 
before the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act established conflict 
mineral–reporting requirements in the United 
States, which will go into effect in May 2014. For 
instance, we helped pilot the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development’s con-
flict minerals due-diligence process.

As part of our commitment, we supported the 
launch of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative  
by the EICC and Global e-Sustainability Initiative 
in 2010, which aims to identify smelters that can 
objectively demonstrate that their raw materials 
do not originate from sources contributing to 
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
We also helped fund an early adopter program 
to make it easier for smelters to get certified.

•  Continued identifying each component used in 
our products containing tin, gold, tantalum, or 
tungsten, and the suppliers of these components. 
As of June 30, 2013, 84 percent of our suppliers 
had sent us information identifying their 
upstream sources for the minerals in question. 

•  From the supplier data we received, we identified 
156 smelters and refineries producing the types 
of minerals covered by the survey. The survey 
revealed that all of the identified tantalum smelt-
ers passed the conflict-free smelter audits, 
although we are still tracing sources for some 
additional suppliers.

We are active members of 
the Public-Private Alliance for 
Responsible Minerals Trade 
This leading multi-stakeholder group is devoted to 
finding supply chain solutions to conflict minerals 
challenges. Read more about the PPA.

for tin, gold, tantalum, and tungsten.

• Enhancing working and living conditions in our Tier 1 factories 
through such efforts as implementing our “model factory” 
program, which includes requirements for standardized  
living conditions, life skills classes, IT skills training, and 
enhanced worker-grievance reporting programs

• Reducing environment and health and safety risks by provid-
ing additional guidelines on common deficiencies identified 
in our audits

Working Responsibly / Governance

“ We’re unified in our intention to 
operate with integrity. Not only 
do we comply with all state and 
federal laws, but we go to great 
effort to be transparent in our 
actions as a company.”

John Seethoff, Vice President and  
Deputy General Counsel

Sound principles, practices, and leaders are critical 
to good business. Accountability at the highest 
levels and ethical conduct throughout the 
company are central to earning and maintaining 
the public’s trust.

Corporate governance 

Corporate governance at Microsoft is designed to 
promote the long-term interests of our sharehold-
ers, maintain internal checks and balances, 
strengthen management accountability, and foster 
responsible decision making. Microsoft continues 
to build on its strong foundation of existing gover-
nance practices through the establishment of new 
policies that further promote these interests.

Engaging proactively with stakeholders

•  Updated investors on developments in our cor-

porate governance framework in an annual letter 
from members of our board’s Governance and 
Nominating Committee.

•  Engaged on a semi-annual basis with investors —  
including public pension funds and socially 
responsible investors, which collectively held 
approximately 35 percent of our outstanding 
shares — about governance- and citizenship-
related topics, and delivered a summary of 
investor feedback to the board.

•  Released a new installment of our director inter-

view series, which we launched in 2009 to inform 
our shareholders about our directors, their back-
ground and experience, and their views about 
the board’s roles and responsibility in serving the 
best interests of our shareholders and other stake-
holders. The latest installment, which featured lead 
independent director John W. Thompson, is 
available on our Investor Relations board of 
directors page.

Managing risk at the board level

Board refreshment

•  Our board is responsible for overseeing risk man-
agement at the company. The board exercises 
direct oversight of strategic risks to the company 
and other risk areas not delegated to one of its 
committees. 

•  Microsoft has a practice of regularly adding new 
directors to its board to continuously infuse  
new ideas and fresh perspective in the boardroom. 
On average, our board appoints a new director 
each year. 

•  The Governance and Nominating Committee of 
the board focuses on the experience and skill  
set of each new director in an effort to create a 
board with diverse viewpoints and expertise 
while maintaining a strong technology-specific 
knowledge base. 

•  With two of our largest shareholders serving on 
the board — as well as members with deep finan-
cial and accounting expertise, proven business 
operations, marketing and strategy experience, 
and exceptional technology backgrounds — we 
continue to focus on maintaining a strong 
balance that will best perpetuate the success of 
the company’s business. 

•  The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the 
company’s processes to manage financial 
reporting risk and to manage investment, tax, 
and other financial risks. It also reviews the com-
pany’s policies for risk assessment and the steps 
management has taken to control significant 
risks, except those delegated by the board to 
other committees. 

•  The Compensation Committee oversees com-

pensation programs and policies and their effect 
on risk taking by management. 

•  The Regulatory and Public Policy Committee 
oversees operational risks, including those 
related to business continuity, security, privacy, 
and competition law.

•  In each case, management periodically reports to 
the board or relevant committee that provides 
guidance on risk assessment and mitigation. Each 
committee charged with risk oversight reports  
up to the board on those matters.

Adhering to strict principles and policies

Transparency in political spending 

•  Clear principles govern our engagement in the 

political process in the United States.

•  Political spending will reflect the company’s 

interests and be used to further its public policy 
agenda and not the personal agenda of individ-
ual officers, directors, or employees.

•  We do not make corporate contributions to any 
noncandidate or nonparty political committees 
organized under section 527 of the Internal 
Revenue Code, which are formed solely to  
influence elections.

•  No campaign contributions are given in  

anticipation of, in recognition of, or in return  
for an official act.

•  We reaffirmed our stance on not making indepen-
dent political expenditures or electioneering 
communications, as permitted under the U.S. 
Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling.

to the company and its stakeholders that may 
affect the company’s operations, performance, 
or reputation.

•  Management of our participation in the political 

process in the United States is the responsibility of 
the vice president for U.S. Government Affairs.  
This position reports directly to Microsoft’s general 
counsel, who reports to the company CEO.

•  The MSPAC Steering Committee, a bipartisan 
committee of Microsoft federal and state gov-
ernment affairs professionals, is responsible for 
oversight and day-to-day decision making related 
to political spending. The committee’s oversight 
spans corporate fund expenditures as well as 
employee and shareholder donations made via 
the MSPAC program.
