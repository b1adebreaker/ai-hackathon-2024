Letter from our CEO 

“Everywhere we operate, we focus on con-
tributing to local communities in positive 
ways—helping to spark growth, competi-
tiveness and economic opportunity for all.”

Dear shareholders, customers, partners, and employees:

Thank you for your support and investment in Microsoft. We’re proud of our prog-
ress this year, and we are eager to make even more progress in the year ahead.

We continue to be guided by our mission to empower every person and every or-
ganization on the planet to achieve more. The breadth and depth of our mission 
unlocks unprecedented opportunity as technology transforms every industry and 
has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone. We strive to create local 
opportunity, growth and impact in every community and country around the world. 
Our platforms and tools enable creativity in all of us, and help drive small-business 
productivity, large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency. They also 
support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower 
human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers’ success.

Now let me share more about what we delivered in fiscal 2017 for our shareholders, 
our customers and partners, and for the communities in which we operate through-
out the world.

PROGRESS AND OUR RESULTS
We delivered $90.0 billion in revenue and $22.3 billion in operating income this past 
fiscal year. Adjusting for Windows 10 revenue deferrals and restructuring expenses, 
revenue was $96.7 billion with $29.3 billion in operating income.

We continued to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while 
maintaining our commitment to shareholder return, which included total cash re-
turn of $22.3 billion this year. 

Microsoft 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report

Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate ended the year exceeding $18.9 
billion, up more than 56 percent year-over-year. Our cloud growth puts us squarely 
on track to reach the goal we set a little over two years ago of $20 billion in com-
mercial cloud annualized revenue run rate in fiscal 2018.

The strength of our results across our reporting segments reflects our accelerating 
innovation as well as increased customer usage and engagement across our busi-
nesses. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

More than 100 million people use Office 365 commercial.

More than 27 million consumers use Office 365 Home & Personal across devices.

More than 53 million members are active on Xbox Live. 

More than 500 million LinkedIn members use the LinkedIn network.

•  Windows 10 is active on more than 500 million devices around the world.

• 

• 

Dynamics 365 customers grew more than 40 percent year-over-year.

Azure compute usage more than doubled year-over-year.

We prioritized our investments to capture our expanding market opportunities. We 
are investing for the future with product innovation complemented by new acquisi-
tions and partnerships. We have completed our acquisition of LinkedIn to connect 
the world’s largest professional network with the world’s leading professional cloud. 
We are investing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity with our 
datacenter expansion, bringing Azure to 42 regions globally — more than any other 
cloud provider — and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the 
industry.

We broadened our offerings to reach new audiences, such as bringing Office 365 
to firstline workers from retail and hospitality to manufacturing. We took collabo-
ration to a new level with Microsoft Teams, which brings people, conversations and 
content together in a digital hub. We are in the forefront of innovating in mixed 
reality and how this new medium can radically change gaming, firstline and knowl-
edge work through immersive experiences. We are innovating in gaming with new 
services such as Mixer and Xbox Game Pass. We introduced hundreds of new Azure 
services, including new cognitive services APIs for vision, speech, text, translation, 
emotion and more. We have galvanized the company’s efforts around AI both to 
power each of our product categories with breakthrough capabilities and make the 
same capabilities available to our customers through Azure. We inspired new ways 
for students and teachers to create and learn with Windows 10 S. And we continued 
to create new device categories with Windows 10 and Surface, including the new 
Surface Studio and Laptop. 

And we’re continually transforming to better serve customers, evolving our sales 
and marketing approach to galvanize around five core customer solution areas.

Across every industry in every corner of the world, our customers are using Micro-
soft technologies to radically transform everything from agriculture to manufactur-
ing, and we are only at the beginning. Here are some examples.

BOEING
Boeing is using Microsoft HoloLens for 3-D visualization to transform employee 
training, and it is using Cortana Intelligence, Azure and Azure IoT to harness a 
wealth of aircraft data. This “digital twin” aircraft increases crew and maintenance 
efficiency, improves customer experience, and creates a new business model and 
services that Boeing can offer its airline customers.

THYSSENKRUPP
Thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens to transform the way it measures, visual-
izes and installs its products, streamlining the initial surveying process of a stair lift 
installation. Using spatial mapping, 3-D visualization and the natural inputs offered 
by mixed reality, the company has digitized its sales and manufacturing processes 
to reduce delivery times as much as 4x, transforming its customer experience and 
growing its business opportunity.

TETRA PAK
Tetra Pak, the world’s largest food packaging company and inventor of the 20th 
century’s most important innovation in that industry, aseptic packaging technology, 
employs Azure to enable its cloud-connected machines to predict exactly when 
equipment needs maintenance. Service engineers use HoloLens to access experts 
who remotely guide them through a repair, reducing time and cost. With the cloud 
and mixed reality, Tetra Pak is delivering new and existing value in a much more 
efficient way — in the most remote locations, on the most mobile devices.

LOOKING FORWARD: OUR EXPANSIVE OPPORTUNITY

A new technology paradigm
As you can begin to see in the examples above, a new technology paradigm is 
emerging, one with an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. Microsoft will lead 
this new era. There are three characteristics that define this shift. The first is that the 
experience layer is becoming multidevice and multisense, where a person’s expe-
rience with technology will span a multitude of devices and become increasingly 
more natural and multisensory with voice, ink, gestures and gaze interactions. Sec-
ond, artificial intelligence (AI) will be pervasive across devices, apps and infrastruc-
ture to drive insights and act on your behalf. Third, computing will be more distrib-
uted than ever before with compute power at the edge, whether it’s the connected 
car, the connected factory floor or any connected device. As developers write new 
applications for this paradigm, they need new mechanisms to manage the complex-
ity of distributed, event-driven computing.

With this new paradigm comes new opportunity. Every customer is looking for both 
innovative technology to drive new growth and a strategic partner that can help 
them build their own digital capability. Customers are looking to change how they 
use digital technology and to reimagine how they empower their employees, en-
gage customers, optimize their operations, and change the very core of their prod-
ucts and services. They are building their own digital systems of intelligence to drive 
growth. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity with the 
combination of our technology, partner ecosystem and culture of growth mindset.

As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we will focus on bringing our technol-
ogy and products together into experiences and solutions that deliver new value 
for our customers. Going forward, we will focus our innovation and investments in 
areas where we see the greatest opportunity for growth.

The modern workplace
The workplace itself is transforming — from changing employee expectations, a 
widening skills gap, more diverse and globally distributed teams, to an increasingly 
complex threat environment. The productivity experiences and tools we deliver will 
unlock the creator in all of us and enable seamless teamwork not just in the work-
place, but also at school and at home across all the devices people use — from 
the phone to the laptop to mixed-reality headsets to the whiteboard. Microsoft 
365 — which brings together Windows 10, Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility & 
Security — will be a key driver of value for our business customers of all sizes and 
for our business growth. The Microsoft Graph, which provides the underlying data 
model of the user’s experience, and the LinkedIn network, will make it possible for 
every professional in any business or functional role to be much more productive in 
getting things done. 

Business applications
Every process inside a business is being digitized. This rapid shift means customers 
are looking to move away from monolithic suites that perpetuate disconnected data 
siloes and expensive custom extensibility frameworks. Our approach with Dynam-
ics 365 and LinkedIn is to build modular business applications that are part of a 
connected data graph, enabling AI and extensibility that span a customer’s business 
process needs. We will enable organizations of all sizes to digitize business-critical 
functions across relationship sales, talent and people processes, operations, cus-
tomer service, field service, and more.

Applications and infrastructure 
Cloud computing is foundational to enabling digital transformation for any organi-
zation. Beyond being a trusted, global, hyper-scale cloud, what makes Azure unique 
is our hybrid consistency, developer productivity and SaaS application integration. 
Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans identity, data, compute, management 
and security, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory re-
quirements of commercial customers and enterprise-focused SaaS ISVs. Azure Stack 
is an extension of Azure that enables developers to build and deploy applications 
the same way whether they run on the intelligent cloud or the intelligent edge. With 
Visual Studio and Azure Services, we provide the toolchain and application platform 
for modern DevOps that helps organizations with their agility and productivity — 
and enable them to use the best of the Windows ecosystem and the best of the 
Linux ecosystem together. Azure enables SaaS ISV developers to reach 100 million 
plus enterprise users through the integration of Azure Active Directory and Office 
365, and by embedding Power BI, Power Apps and Flow as part of their applica-
tions, enables customers to have consistent identity, developer extensibility and 
security across their application portfolio spanning their own custom applications 
and SaaS applications. 

Data and AI
The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to reason over 
its data using AI to drive competitive advantage. Microsoft Research continues to 
make significant advances in AI technologies, infusing them into product experienc-
es like Bing, Cortana, LinkedIn Newsfeed, Skype Translator, Editor and PowerPoint 
Designer in Office, Relationship Health in Dynamics, HoloLens, and many more. We 
are uniquely positioned to take this AI capability and democratize it, so that every 
developer can be an AI developer, and every company can become an AI company. 
It all starts with having support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure 
Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse and Data Lake, combined with SQL Server. 
Azure is the cloud with the richest set of ML tools, bot framework and cognitive 
services, enabling developers to add AI capabilities into their applications. With 
state-of-the-art GPU and FPGA support, our Azure infrastructure is best in class for 
AI workloads. I am excited about our road map here and what’s to come.

Gaming
The $100 billion plus gaming industry is experiencing massive growth and transfor-
mation, and we have an expansive opportunity as we think about gaming end-to-
end — from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and 
viewed. We will build on our strong foundation of connected gaming assets across 
PC, console, mobile and work to grow and engage the 53 million strong Xbox Live 
member network more deeply and frequently — from great game experiences to 
streaming to social to mixed reality. We will be the company for gamers to play the 
games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. I’m excited 
about our opportunity to accelerate our growth opportunity, innovate boldly and 
earn new fans.

While these solution areas capture our near-term opportunity, we’re also investing 
in cutting-edge research to lead well into the future. Artificial intelligence, mixed 
reality and quantum computing will come together and shape the future of our 
industry and others for generations to come. We’re deeply committed to leading in 
these areas and bringing them together in ways that enable humanity to solve our 
most pressing issues, from climate change to curing cancer to creating economic 
opportunity for all. We will do so by adhering to the highest ethical principles and 
standing for our timeless values.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WORLD 
Our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet ex-
tends to our corporate social responsibility efforts. We strive to use our technology, 
grants, employees and voice to improve people’s lives by enabling access to the 
benefits and opportunities that technology offers. This past year we increased our 
investments across a range of strategic initiatives.

• 

• 

• 

Microsoft Philanthropies donated more than $1.2 billion in software and services in fiscal 2017, 
helping nonprofits around the world get the technology and skills they need for today’s digital 
economy.

Since 2016 we have donated more than $1 billion in cloud services to more than 90,000 nonprofits 
and university researchers — achieving our $1 billion milestone a year early — and announced a 
new plan to more than triple the number of nonprofits we’ll reach to 300,000 over the next three 
years.

Our employees raised a record-breaking $142 million through our employee giving program 
in 2016. I am proud and humbled by their commitment to not only make a difference with our 
customers and partners, but in their local communities and the broader world.

•  We’re ensuring that our products and services are accessible to meet the needs of all our custom-
ers, including the more than 1 billion people around the world with disabilities. Examples include 
our new Eye Control feature in Windows 10 for people with ALS, and Seeing AI, a free app on iOS 
for blind and low vision users that narrates the world around you.

•  We’re partnering with telecommunications companies through our Rural Airband Initiative to 

bring broadband connectivity to 2 million people in rural America by 2022, helping to close the 
rural broadband gap for the more than 20 million Americans living in rural communities who lack 
access to the economic, educational and health opportunities the internet provides.

•  We’re advancing our sustainability efforts, completing our largest wind energy purchase to date 

and aiming to address some of the world’s toughest environment challenges through our new AI 
for Earth initiative.

• 

Finally, as part of our broader responsibility to engage thoughtfully in the public dialogue on the 
important challenges facing our world, we published “A Cloud for Global Good” to help compa-
nies and governments ensure technology is trusted, responsible and inclusive.

When I reflect on the past year, I’m proud of our progress — both in our own 
continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to digitally 
transform.

As a multinational corporation, we have both a substantial opportunity and a high 
responsibility to ensure that technology’s benefits reach people more broadly across 
our global society and economy. Everywhere we operate, we focus on contributing 
to local communities in positive ways — helping to spark growth, competitiveness 
and economic opportunity for all. 

To serve the needs of our customers well into the future, we must continually trans-
form while remaining steadfast to our timeless values. Microsoft has both the capa-
bility and the culture to help customers digitally transform today, while creating new 
technologies that are among the most innovative and impactful humankind has 
ever experienced with mixed reality, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

We will continue to invest in the highest growth opportunities, innovate boldly, and 
empower people and organizations by creating the platforms and tools that enable 
others to grow and thrive, now and well into the future.

Governance of CSR

Empowering every person and every organization on the planet 
to achieve more means going beyond providing the products and 
services that allow our customers to do great things. It means being 
thoughtful about the impact of our own business practices, policies, 
and investments in communities.

Microsoft’s Technology and Corporate Responsibility (TCR) team, in collabora-
tion with leaders across Microsoft’s business and operations, drives companywide 
approaches to key corporate social responsibility issues. The head of TCR reports 
directly to Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, who sits on 
Microsoft’s Senior Leadership Team and reports directly to our CEO, Satya Nadella. 
We work together to earn the trust and confidence of the public, our customers, 
partners, employees, and shareholders. 

The charter for the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Direc-
tors includes the responsibility to “review and provide guidance to the board and 
management about the company’s policies and programs that relate to corporate 
social responsibility, including human rights, environmental sustainability, responsi-
ble sourcing, and philanthropy.”  

Microsoft’s work in corporate social responsibility fosters sustained business success 
over the long term. Our corporate governance framework, policies, and practices 
are described in detail in our financial filings and on the corporate governance sec-
tion of our Investor Relations website.    

Details about Microsoft’s Ethics and Compliance policies and programs include our 
Standards of Business Conduct, which applies to Microsoft employees, executive 
officers, our Board of Directors, and Microsoft subsidiaries and controlled affiliates 
(where Microsoft directly or indirectly owns more than 50 percent of the voting con-
trol). Channels are provided to ensure that concerns can be raised and subsequently
addressed. All Microsoft employees must complete an annual Standards of Business 
Conduct training course, available in 16 languages. In FY17, as in previous years, 
course completion was more than 99 percent. In addition, mandatory trainings ad-
dress the compliance risks of specific roles and business functions, while a variety of 
additional guidance options ensure awareness of our policies and our expectations 
for ethical behavior.

We know that the decisions we make affect our employees, customers, partners, 
shareholders, suppliers, and communities. That’s why we take their voices into ac-
count. Microsoft receives input from millions of people each year—from individual 
customers to policymakers and global human rights specialists. We bring outside 
perspectives into the company and inform our business decisions through a variety 
of feedback channels. And we go beyond formal channels, proactively engaging 
with key stakeholders, advocacy groups, widely recognized experts, CSR rating 
agencies, CSR-focused investors, and many others. We also share our learnings 
and practices thereby generating industry dialogue, informing public debate, and 
advancing greater progress.

Microsoft works to align our CSR commitments and CSR reporting to global stan-
dards. We base our CSR reporting on the Global Reporting Initiatives’ Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines; in 2006, we endorsed the United Nations Global Com-
pact; and we file an annual Communication on Progress implementing the UNGC’s 
10 principles. In addition, we were among the first companies to align our human 
rights work with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to 
adopt the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. We’re actively engaged 
in supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals and publicly report ways in 
which Microsoft contributes to the global effort to achieve the SDGs.

Driving positive impact to both 
business and society

We apply the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to 
our CSR materiality assessment to define our most significant CSR issues. Using this 
approach, we’ve identified the top issues. Our CSR materiality assessment reflects 
input gathered from our stakeholder engagement processes, consultation with 
Business for Social Responsibility, and other external experts, and consideration of 
the impact that Microsoft’s core businesses have.

During the launch of A Cloud for Global Good, Microsoft’s policy roadmap, Micro-
soft President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, articulated how we prioritize our 
CSR issues and how they connect to our business success:  

“Technology is creating new jobs, but automation can challenge and even replace 
some traditional jobs. There are new challenges to privacy rights. There are new ques-
tions about income inequality. There are new opportunities but also challenges for 
people with disabilities.” 

“If we don’t acknowledge explicitly, at the outset, that this new era creates both 
opportunity and challenge, the truth is we’ll do less than we should to make the most 
of the promise that lies ahead. We need to ensure that we move technology forward 
without leaving people behind.” 

“This requires that we accept a sense of shared responsibility. Those of us who work in 
the tech sector and the private sector have an important role and responsibility, as do 
people across civil society, and as do governments around the world.” 

To fulfill that responsibility, we need to ensure that the cloud is trusted, responsible 
and inclusive. Microsoft’s efforts include:

• 

• 

• 

Our human rights commitments, and our commitments to privacy and data security work to 
ensure that our cloud is trusted. 
Our commitments to environmental sustainability, responsible sourcing, and empowering our 
employees to ensure that our cloud is responsible.
Our commitments to accessibility, global diversity and inclusion, and empowering communities to 
ensure that our cloud is inclusive.

Privacy and data security

We recognize privacy as a fundamental human right. We work to pre-
serve our customers’ ability to control their data and make informed 
choices to protect their privacy. 

Our commitment and approach

Microsoft’s privacy practices and the way we build our products and services rest on 
six key privacy principles. 

Control  
We put users in control of their privacy with easy-to-use tools and clear choices.  

Transparency  
We’re transparent about data collection and use so users can make informed deci-
sions.  

Security   
We protect the data that users entrust to us through strong security and encryption.  

Legal protections  
We respect local privacy laws and fight for the protection of users’ privacy as a fun-
damental human right.  

No content-based targeting   
We don’t use email, chat, files, or other personal content to target ads.  

User benefits   
When we do collect data, we use it to benefit you and your experiences.  

FY17 Highlights

We’re standing up for users’ rights, allowing them to view and control their activi-
ty; we’re committing to compliance across the cloud; and we’re hiring reknowned 
leaders in the field to guide our way.

Launching privacy dashboard   
In January 2017, Microsoft launched a new web-based privacy dashboard that 
allows users to see and control their activity data across multiple Microsoft services. 
This allows users to view—and choose to clear—the data that Microsoft collects, 
such as browsing history, search history, and location activity, and to manage infor-
mation in the Cortana Notebook, which provides personalized recommendations. 
We will add additional data types and functionality over time.

Privacy shield certification  
In August 2016, Microsoft became the first listed global cloud service provider to 
meet the U.S. Department of Commerce Privacy Shield certification. The EU-US 
Privacy Shield Framework was designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and 
European Commission to apply EU data protection requirements to govern data 
transmission between Europe and the United States.

Leading regulator takes privacy post  
In April 2017, Microsoft announced that it had hired former Commissioner of the 
U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Julie Brill, to lead privacy, data protection, and other 
regulatory issues at Microsoft. Brill is a globally recognized leader on privacy, data 
protection, and cybersecurity law and policy.

Enabling compliance with new privacy protections
In May 2018, the European Union is imposing strong new privacy rules: The General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Microsoft believes GDPR is an important step 
forward for privacy rights and we’re committed to GDPR compliance across our 
cloud services. We’re among the first cloud service providers to include GDPR-relat-
ed assurances in our contractual commitments with customers and are committed 
to helping other organizations comply as well.

Stranding up for users’ rights  
Microsoft has helped lead our industry in pushing for reform in government 
surveillance in the U.S. and around the world. We’re challenging an effort by the 
U.S. government to use search warrants unilaterally to reach beyond U.S. borders. 
We’re supporting efforts to modernize U.S. surveillance laws and sparked the idea 
of a Digital Geneva Convention—an international treaty to protect civilians from 
state-sponsored cyberattacks.

Responsible sourcing   

We work to ensure that our suppliers uphold high standards for re-
sponsible business practices and how they treat the people who work 
for them. 

Our commitment and approach

We set high standards for our suppliers and collaborate with them to positively im-
pact their workers, the communities in which they operate, and their own business.  

Microsoft has relationships with thousands of suppliers around the globe, spanning 
both hardware suppliers that manufacture our devices and the components that go 
into them and indirect suppliers that provide everything from advertising services to 
building construction and maintenance.   

We expect all suppliers who do business with Microsoft to uphold the human rights, 
labor, health and safety, environmental, and business ethics practices prescribed in 
our Supplier Code of Conduct. This code aligns with, and in certain cases exceeds, 
the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition’s (EICC’s) responsible supply chain stan-
dards. The Supplier Code of Conduct is included in all our contracts with suppliers 
and Microsoft Social and Environmental Accountability requirements are also incor-
porated into our contracts with hardware and packaging suppliers.  

Since 2005, Microsoft’s Devices and Supply Chain group has operated an indus-
try-leading Social and Environmental Accountability (SEA) program to ensure that 
our hardware and packaging suppliers conform to our Supplier Code of Conduct 
and additional device-related requirements for living conditions, safe working prac-
tices, and environmental, health, and safety protection.   

Microsoft’s Global Procurement Group created a formal responsible sourcing func-
tion in 2013 to consolidate and enhance its responsible sourcing activities with our 
indirect suppliers.

We advance our responsible sourcing commitments through:  

• 
• 
• 
• 

Analysis of risks and opportunities
Assurance and accountability 
Capacity building
Creating shared value and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN to im-
prove people’s quality of life, protect the environment, and foster equitable growth.

Environmental  
sustainability 

Microsoft is committed to leveraging technology to solve some of the 
world’s most urgent environmental issues, and focusing on key areas 
where we believe we can have the most positive impact.

Our commitment and approach

Empowering every person and organization on the planet to thrive in a re-
source-constrained world.

Focus areas
We focus our environmental sustainability work in the five areas where we believe 
we can have the greatest positive impact—carbon, energy, water, ecosystems (in-
cluding food, agriculture, and biodiversity), and circular economy (including waste 
reduction). Across these areas, we work to reduce our impact within our own opera-
tions, collaborate with our partners to take advantage of digital transformations that 
reduce their footprint, and support innovation, R&D, and policies that help create a 
more sustainable future.    

Carbon  
We achieved carbon neutrality annually by improving operational efficiency, buying 
clean energy, and investing in carbon offset community projects. We fund both our 
carbon neutrality commitment and environmental innovation initiatives with our 
internal sustainability fee—charging our business groups for their emissions from 
electricity and air travel. We use our digital technology to decouple our economic 
growth from carbon emissions in our supply chain operations. And we disclose our 
carbon emissions and approach to climate change annually through CDP.

Energy
We’ve committed to using 50 percent wind, solar, and hydropower electricity in our 
datacenters and campus by the end of 2018, to meet 60 percent early in the next 
decade, and to continue growing that percentage moving forward. We support 
the global clean energy transition by investing in technology research for smarter, 
greener grids, working to make clean energy more accessible and affordable, and 
backing clean energy policy. We increase the energy efficiency of our new devices 
and leverage the energy saving capabilities of Windows 10 to provide a better user 
experience while reducing consumer energy use. And we make our efforts acces-
sible by reporting our energy consumption—including renewable energy procure-
ment—annually through CDP.

Water  
At Microsoft, we believe in the sustainable management of the water resources we 
use across our operations. To support this, we’re focused on increasing our under-
standing of water-related risks and impacts to our business and to the communities 
we serve, setting meaningful goals, improving our water efficiency, and advancing 
innovative solutions to water challenges. Partnerships with companies like Ecolab, 
and technology innovations like the free, publicly-available Water Risk Monetizer 
tool, are not just helping Microsoft address its water-related risks—they’re also 
enabling other organizations to understand the true value, risks, and impacts of 
water in their operations. We make our efforts transparent by disclosing our annual 
water use, our water-related risks and governance of water through CDP. Further, 
we collaborate with our top spend production suppliers to achieve 95% reporting of 
water usage also through CDP.

Ecosystems  
Operationally, we’re investing in the long-term viability of ecosystems in the com-
munities in which we operate. Through AI for Earth, we’re bringing together AI and 
cloud technologies, environmental science, and programmatic resources to empow-
er people and organizations to solve global environmental challenges across water, 
agriculture, biodiversity, and climate change.

Circular economy and waste reduction
Our Puget Sound campus is zero-waste certified, and we’re working to reduce 
overall waste, and to divert at least 90 percent of our operational waste from land-
fills. We design our products, buildings, and operations around resource reduction 
and reuse, enabling a more resource-efficient and productive economy. Microsoft is 
a member of over 150 recycling programs worldwide, covering electronics, batteries, 
and packaging.

FY17 Highlights

We’re focusing on water conservation, committing to renewable energy plans, and 
helping to optimize energy use and costs all over the world. 

Support a greener grid 
To support a greener grid, we’ve signed a large renewable energy deal to power 
our Wyoming datacenter entirely by wind. We’ve also made our datacenter’s back-
up generators available to the local grid to boost reliability and capacity.  

Learn about our wind energy purchase 

Innovating on carbon 
We’ve been carbon neutral since 2012, and we’re still innovating in this space. In 
2017, we bought the first-ever carbon credits generated by US rice farmers—open-
ing a new door in carbon markets for agriculture.

Microsoft and the UN 
Sustainable Development 
Goals

In September 2015, the UN General Assembly agreed to 17 global Sustainable De-
velopment Goals (SDGs) to reach by 2030. The goals and specific targets under the 
goals seek to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all.

Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet 
to achieve more aligns strongly to the UN SDGs. To better understand how we and 
other information technology companies can advance the goals, Microsoft was a 
lead sponsor of a report by the Global E-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and Accen-
ture called “#SystemTransformation.” The report found that digital technology can 
help put all the SDGs within reach by enabling a broad range of economic and 
social opportunities worldwide.

In September 2017, we produced a white paper to identify ways in which Microsoft 
contributes to the global effort to achieve the SDGs. (Read the report here.)

As we continue to advance our thinking and work to address the SDGs, we’ll update 
this page with further information.
