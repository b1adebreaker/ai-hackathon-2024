Microsoft 2014 
Citizenship Report

Letter From Our CEO

We advanced our three-year commitment to 
create opportunities for 300 million youth by 2015 
under the Microsoft YouthSpark initiative.  
YouthSpark has created education, employment, 
and entrepreneurship opportunities for 227 million 
youth since launch, including 124 million in FY14. 

We continue to implement an industry-leading 
carbon neutrality program and expand our invest-
ments in renewable energy to power our cloud 
services. In FY14, we purchased more than  
3 billion kilowatt-hours of green power, equal  
to 100 percent of our global electricity use. 

This year we also faced new challenges and took 
bold steps forward to meet our longstanding 
commitment to ensuring the privacy and  
security of our customers’ data. This included 
expanding our use of encryption across our 
services, providing choice and transparency on 
data location, and strengthening legal protections 
for our customers’ privacy. We led the way in 
advocating for reform of government surveillance 
practices. Going forward, we are committed to 
using data to create intelligent, personal experi-
ences that help our customers do more while 
maintaining the security and privacy of their data. 

In FY14, we made marked progress against our  
citizenship commitments and I am energized and 
optimistic about our ongoing work in these areas.  
I am committed to advancing our citizenship  
commitments as we move forward with intensity 
to once again change the world. 

Sincerely,

Satya Nadella
Chief Executive Officer

We are entering a world where there will soon  
be more than 3 billion people with Internet- 
connected devices — from a farmer in a remote 
part of the world with a smartphone to a profes-
sional power user with multiple devices powered 
by cloud-based apps spanning work and life.  
Our ambition for this world is simple yet bold.  
At our core, Microsoft is the productivity and 
platform company for the mobile-first, cloud- 
first world. We will reinvent productivity to 
empower every person and every organization  
on the planet to do more and achieve more. 

Our customers and society expect us to maximize 
the value of technology while also preserving  
the values that are timeless. Microsoft’s commit-
ments to corporate citizenship help us meet  
these expectations.  

In fiscal year (FY) 2014, we expanded our work 
to help nonprofits do more with technology and 
donated $948.6 million of software and hard-
ware to more than 86,000 nonprofits around the 
globe. This includes the launch of Office 365 for 
Nonprofits, with $55 million worth of Office 365 
subscriptions donated to 11,500 NGOs in  
74 countries.

Environmental Sustainability 

More than 99 percent of Microsoft employees completed 
annual training on our Standards of Business Conduct, which 
is available globally in 17 languages. 

Microsoft’s total annual giving surpassed $1 billion for the 
first time, with cash donations of $119 million and in-kind 
donations worth $948.6 million. 

The Board of Directors appointed an independent  
Chairman, John Thompson, coincident with Satya Nadella’s 
appointment as Chief Executive Officer.

Our People

Eighty-six percent of employees polled said they would  
recommend Microsoft as a great place to work.

The percentage of women in our global workforce grew  
from 24 to 28 percent and the percentage of Microsoft  
senior executive women and minorities increased from  
22 to 27 percent.

The Microsoft YouthSpark Initiative is on track to surpass our 
goal of creating opportunities for 300 million youth over 
three years, having created opportunities for 227 million 
youth to date, including 124 million in FY14.  

We launched Office 365 for Nonprofits in 92 countries  
around the world, providing $55 million worth of Office 365 
subscriptions to nearly 11,500 nonprofits globally.

Human Rights 

We instituted new privacy and data security measures includ-
ing expanding our use of encryption across our services, 
providing choice and transparency on data location, and 
strengthening legal protections for customers. We fought  
for and won the right to increase our disclosure on the  
volume of national security orders for customer data that  
we receive from the US government.

Microsoft completed the Global Network Initiative (GNI) 
Phase III Assessment, conducted by an independent  
assessor, and the GNI Board determined that Microsoft  
is compliant with the GNI Principles on Freedom of  
Expression and Privacy.

In FY14, we completed 217 third-party audits and Microsoft 
assessments of 131 Tier 1 and high- and medium-risk Tier 2 
hardware suppliers. Critical/serious nonconformance  
findings are detailed in this report. In all of these instances, 
the suppliers instituted corrective action plans that were  
approved by Microsoft, and follow-up audits confirmed that 
the suppliers were implementing the corrective action plans.

We also expanded our work with our hardware suppliers  
to build their capabilities on environmental health  
and safety management and to improve factory workers’  
living environments.

Microsoft began to screen our non-hardware suppliers 
against 23 different ethical, social, and environmental risks  
by country and by commodity category and to roll out  
new assurance requirements for the suppliers found to pose 
the highest risks.

We met our carbon neutrality commitment through  
internal efficiency projects, the purchase of more than  
3 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of renewable energy  
(equal to 100 percent of our global electricity use), and  
a carbon offset project portfolio representing more than 
600,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

We achieved our goal that all new datacenters have an  
average 1.125 Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which  
is one-third less than the industry average datacenter  
PUE of 1.7.

1.2 Citizenship Governance

Microsoft’s citizenship mission is to serve globally the needs of communities 
and fulfill our responsibilities to the public. 

The Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors assists  
the board in overseeing the company’s policies and programs that relate to certain  
legal, regulatory, and compliance matters, business risks related to privacy and  
cybersecurity, and public policy and corporate citizenship, including public issues  
of significance to the company and its stakeholders that may affect the  
company’s operations, performance, or reputation.

The committee’s charter specifically calls for the committee to “review and provide 
guidance to the board and management about the company’s policies and programs 
that relate to corporate citizenship, including human rights, environmental sustain-
ability, corporate social responsibility, supply chain management, charitable giving, 
and political activities and expenditures.”  

Microsoft 2014 Citizenship Report

Microsoft’s Citizenship and Public Affairs team sits 
within our Legal and Corporate Affairs Group and 
drives initiatives and engages with groups across 
Microsoft to help the company fulfill its respon-
sibilities as a global corporate citizen and deliver 
added value to the company and its stakeholders. 
This team of 30+ professionals develops our global 
citizenship strategies and works in partnership 
with local Microsoft citizenship and corporate 
affairs professionals around the world to advance 
our citizenship commitments wherever we do 
business. The General Manager of Citizenship and 
Public Affairs reports directly to Microsoft’s Execu-
tive Vice President and General Counsel, who sits 
on CEO Satya Nadella’s Senior Leadership Team.  

More broadly, citizenship at Microsoft relies on  
the combined efforts of all our employees, includ-
ing colleagues in dozens of other leadership roles, 
business and operational groups, and global 
subsidiaries. Together, they help identify emerging 
issues and societal challenges where Microsoft  
can add the greatest value, develop and imple-
ment new strategies and programs, and monitor 
our progress. 

Stakeholder Engagement

We regularly communicate with thousands  
of stakeholders globally ranging from parents  
concerned about their child’s online safety to 
international human rights experts. These engage-
ments take many forms. Employees from our 
business and operational groups regularly identify 
and engage with stakeholders in the course of 
their daily work activities. Our Citizenship  
and Public Affairs team also manages a number  
of stakeholder relationships and ongoing  
dialogues to help inform and guide our strategies. 
We connect with leading thinkers on corporate 
responsibility and societal challenges in groups 
such as Business for Social Responsibility, the 
Clinton Global Initiative, and the World Economic 
Forum. We learn from them and other advocacy 
groups, socially responsible investors, corporate 
responsibility rating agencies, other external 
stakeholders, and our own employees to identify 
new and emerging citizenship issues. We also  
base our work on international frameworks such  
as the United Nations Global Compact, the  
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human  
Rights, and the Global Reporting Initiatives’  
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

Customers

Investors

We gain insights from online feedback, support  
communities, product satisfaction surveys, usability 
studies, research forums, business account managers, 
and our customer service representatives. 

Beyond traditional investor communications such as 
earnings calls and our annual meeting, we seek to 
proactively provide investors with corporate gover-
nance information through diverse communications, 
including a director video interview series and direct 
communications from independent members of our 
board to shareholders. Twice a year, we proactively 
reach out to institutional investors – including public 
pension funds and socially responsible investors – 
about governance and citizenship-related topics and 
deliver a summary of their feedback to the board. In 
FY14, these engagements reached investors holding 
over 30 percent of our outstanding shares. We seek to 
transparently provide information sought by socially 
responsible investors and corporate responsibility 
rating agencies and seek their insights to identify new 
and emerging citizenship issues. 

Customer feedback and insights  
underlie all of our decisions to enhance 
existing products and develop new 
ones. Customer feedback also plays an 
important role in helping us develop 
clearer and more customer friendly 
contracts and terms of use policies.

Our engagement with investors has 
influenced many important parts 
of our citizenship strategy, such as  
our human rights commitments  
under the Global Network Initiative, a 
collaborative effort between informa-
tion and communications technology 
(ICT) companies, human rights groups, 
socially responsible investors, and 
others. Investors are an important 
influence as we continue to consider 
ways to enhance our corporate 
governance principles and policies to 
serve the interests of our shareholders 
and other stakeholders.

Employees

Suppliers

Policymakers

We ask for – and act on – employee feedback in 
multiple ways, including conducting an annual online 
anonymous poll of all our employees around the 
world. The poll, with a nearly 90 percent response rate, 
asks employees to share feedback about the Microsoft 
work experience, including how they feel about their 
workgroups, organization, and company as a whole. 
Microsoft offers employees, customers, suppliers, and 
other external parties multiple ways to report compli-
ance concerns as described in our Ethical Business 
Conduct and Governance chapter. 

We engage with suppliers through capacity- 
building workshops and trainings, supplier  
advisory boards, and industry coalitions, such as  
the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition.  
We also conduct anonymous Voice of the Supplier 
Surveys, which include questions on citizenship issues.

Microsoft engages actively in policy issues relevant  
to our business, both directly and through industry  
associations. We seek to ensure that our participa-
tion in the political process takes place in the light of 
day and for reasons that are clear and justifiable to 
our shareholders and the public. Our public policy 
engagement is guided by a publicly available Global 
Public Policy Agenda, which outlines our policy posi-
tions on issues core to our business.

Microsoft’s Senior Leadership Team 
and individual managers use the poll 
results to further improve on areas of 
strength and address opportunities for 
improvement.

Our work to address environmental 
and social issues in collaboration 
with our suppliers is detailed in the 
Responsible Sourcing chapter.

Microsoft is recognized as a leader  
for policies that help to ensure  
the accountability and transparency  
of our engagement in the public  
policy process.

Communities

Microsoft’s local citizenship teams work directly with 
community groups and in partnerships with local non-
profits. They share views and insights from local  
communities with Microsoft’s global Citizenship and 
Public Affairs team in direct communications,  
through regular conference calls, and at an annual 
global summit.

Microsoft’s YouthSpark Initiative and 
Office 365 for Nonprofits program 
were both strongly shaped by input 
from local communities about the 
best way to serve economic and social 
needs in their area.

Industry coalitions 
and public-private 
partnerships

Microsoft actively participates in industry coalitions to 
address important citizenship issues and in many cases 
is among the leaders bringing companies together to 
work collaboratively to solve challenges.

Civil society/ 
nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs)

Across the breadth of our business, we engage  
with thousands of NGOs working on issues ranging 
from environmental sustainability to employee  
diversity to child safety. 

Microsoft has helped establish 
groups that help set the standard for 
responsible business practices in the 
ICT industry ranging from the Elec-
tronics Industry Citizenship Coalition 
and Global Network Initiative to the 
International Association of Accessibil-
ity Professionals.

Virtually all of the initiatives described 
throughout this Citizenship Report 
have benefitted from insights provided 
by NGOs and in many cases involve 
active ongoing partnerships with them.

Commitment to Ethics and  
Standards of Business Conduct 

Trust is paramount to the success of any business. We recognize that this is increas-
ingly true for Microsoft as we evolve our business in a cloud-first, mobile-first  
world. We work to build and maintain trust through a shared commitment to ethical 
behavior and by acting with integrity in everything we do. 

Microsoft regularly interacts with customers, partners, competitors, shareholders, 
suppliers, representatives, regulatory agencies, and government officials. We are 
committed to engaging all of these groups in a respectful, ethical manner and in 
compliance with all legal requirements. 

Our commitments to ethical business practices and strong corporate governance 
policies are designed to promote the long-term interests of our shareholders,  
maintain internal checks and balances, promote accountability at all levels of our 
organization, and foster responsible decision making. We are proud that because 
of our commitments and actions, we’ve been on the Ethisphere Institute’s list of the 
World’s Most Ethical Companies every year since they began issuing the list in 2011.

Microsoft provides employees with a wide range  
of both mandatory and optional training and 
guidance to ensure awareness of our policies and 
expectations for ethical behavior. The graphic on 
the following page from the Microsoft Standards 
of Business Conduct reflects our straightforward 
approach and encourages employees to consult 
with internal resources when necessary.  

Microsoft’s Standards of Business Conduct 
are the foundation of our commitment to 
ethical business practices and legal compliance. 
These standards are endorsed by the Microsoft 
Board of Directors and apply to all employees, 
directors, and executive officers of Microsoft and 
its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates (Microsoft 
directly or indirectly owns more than 50 percent  
of the voting control).  

In FY14, we expanded Microsoft’s Standards of 
Business Conduct by adding new standards related 
to human rights and environmental sustainability. 

All Microsoft employees must complete annual 
training on our Standards of Business Conduct. 
The training course is available in 17 languages. 
In FY14, as in previous years, we achieved a  
completion rate for the course of greater than  
99 percent. In addition, a variety of mandatory 
role-specific trainings address the compliance  
risks of particular business functions.

2.2 Commitment to Ethics and  

Standards of Business Conduct 

Business Conduct and  
Compliance Program

Across Microsoft’s business, we build and monitor 
internal controls to identify and mitigate risks  
of unethical and non-compliant conduct, perform 
regular internal audits, require multiple levels  
of approval for contracting and expenditures, 
and maintain internal compliance scorecards that 
impact key leaders’ performance compensation. 
Our responsibility is to take steps to train  
our employees, to build controls to prevent and  
detect unethical and non-compliant conduct  
and, when we identify or learn of concerns  
or improper conduct, to investigate them fully  
and take appropriate action to remediate. 

Microsoft’s Office of Legal Compliance is respon-
sible for our Business Conduct and Compliance 
Program, working closely with the rest of  
Microsoft Legal and Corporate Affairs, Finance, 
Human Resources, Internal Audit, and other 
groups focused on ensuring compliance.  
Microsoft employs over 170 compliance profes-
sionals globally, including over 50 people  

whose primary role is investigating potential 
breaches of company policy.  

The leaders of the Office of Legal Compliance  
have direct access and reporting obligations to  
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Microsoft offers employees and external parties 
multiple ways to report compliance concerns. 
These include the following:

•  Calling a toll-free telephone integrity hotline 
that is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week  
by a third-party vendor (operators are available 
to receive calls in 49 languages); 

•  Submitting an online report through a publicly 
available website operated by the vendor (the 
landing page for the site is in 16 languages and 
the online reporting tool is in 49 languages); 

•  Emailing the Office of Legal Compliance  

directly at buscond@microsoft.com; and 

•  Emailing, calling, or faxing the  

Director of Compliance.

Example of Microsoft Guidance  
to Employees on Making Ethical Decisions

We expect you to be well informed and exercise good judgment 
when making business decisions for Microsoft. Before making a 
business decision, ask yourself the following questions:

Is it consistent with 
our core values and 
the Standards?

We expect you to think 
through the issues and to 
use available resources 
to help, including our core 
values and the Standards.

Is it legal?

We are not expecting 
you to be a lawyer or legal 
expert. We do expect 
you to ask questions and 
seek guidance if you 
are not sure.

Am I comfortable with 
others finding out 
about my decision?

If you would not be 
comfortable sharing your 
decision with friends, 
family, and co-workers, it 
probably is not the right 
thing to do.

If you cannot answer “yes” or you are not sure, do not make the  
decision or take the action until you get additional help and guidance.

2.3 Corporate Governance

Standards of Business Conduct 

Preventing retaliation is critical to the Business 
Conduct and Compliance Program. Microsoft 
maintains and communicates an open-door policy 
and strictly prohibits retaliation against complain-
ants who raise a compliance concern in good faith. 
Microsoft is committed to handling all inquiries 
discreetly and preserving the confidentiality  
of anyone requesting guidance or reporting  
a possible violation to the extent possible and  
within the limits allowed by the laws.

Anti-corruption

Microsoft’s Standards of Business Conduct and 
Anti-Corruption Policy for Representatives 
include strong commitments to observing the 
standards of conduct set forth in the US Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act and the applicable anti- 
corruption and anti-money laws of all the  
countries in which we operate. We prohibit corrup-
tion of government officials and the payment  
of bribes or kickbacks of any kind, whether  
in dealings with public officials or individuals in  
the private sector. We require partners to provide 
anti-corruption training to all employees who 
resell, distribute, or market Microsoft products  

Microsoft 2014 Citizenship Report

or services and provide them a free, online  
training course available in multiple languages.  
Microsoft’s Supplier Code of Conduct also 
includes strong ethics and anti-corruption provi-
sions, which are highlighted in an online Supplier 
Code of Conduct Training that suppliers must 
take. These are both available in 33 languages.

Beyond clearly communicating our expectations,  
Microsoft vets third-party representatives and 
certain suppliers to help ensure that we only 
engage those that are legitimate businesses with 
a reputation for integrity. We conducted a risk 
assessment to identify higher-risk representative 
types, which were then vetted along with many 
other lower-risk representative types. This includes 
channel partners, consultants, lobbyists, and other 
third parties engaged by Microsoft and its subsid-
iaries and joint ventures worldwide. In addition,  
we continue to have third-party reviews conducted 
for all new suppliers. Since the vetting program’s 
inception, Microsoft has screened nearly 100,000 
representatives and suppliers to enable Microsoft 
to monitor the risk profile and drive risk mitigation 
efforts accordingly. 

Through oversight, review, and counsel, Microsoft’s Board of Directors establishes 
and promotes Microsoft’s business and organizational objectives. The board  
oversees the company’s business affairs and integrity, works with management to 
determine the company’s mission and long-term strategy, performs the annual  
CEO evaluation, oversees CEO succession planning, establishes internal control over  
financial reporting, and assesses company risks and strategies for risk mitigation. 

The board routinely reviews evolving practices to 
determine those that will best serve the interests 
of our shareholders. Microsoft is a leader in adopt-
ing standards to increase accountability to our 
shareholders, including early adoption of majority 
voting for board directors and Say on Pay advisory 
votes on executive compensation. (Our corporate 
governance factsheet is available here.) We sepa-
rated the Board Chair and CEO positions,  
and in FY14 our Lead Independent Director John 
Thompson assumed the role of independent 
Chairman of the Board. Bill Gates, formerly chair-
man, remains on the board and assumed a new 
role as Founder and Technology Advisor to devote  
time to supporting Mr. Nadella in shaping the 
technology and product direction of the company. 

Microsoft’s director independence guidelines meet 
or exceed the independence requirements  
of NASDAQ listing standards and US Securities and 
Exchange Commission rules.

Microsoft’s Board of Directors maintains four 
standing committees to assist it in discharging its 
oversight responsibilities: an Audit Committee, 
a Compensation Committee, a Governance and 
Nominating Committee, and a Regulatory and 
Public Policy Committee. Only independent direc-
tors serve on these committees. Each committee 
has duties assigned by the board in compliance 
with Microsoft’s Bylaws and a committee charter, 
which are each available online.

2.3 Corporate Governance

2.4 Public Policy Engagement

Among the duties spelled out in the Regulatory 
and Public Policy Committee’s charter is to  
“Review and provide guidance to the Board and 
management about the Company’s policies  
and programs that relate to corporate citizenship, 
including human rights, environmental sustain-
ability, corporate social responsibility, supply chain 
management, charitable giving, and political  
activities and expenditures.”  

We seek to proactively provide investors with 
corporate governance information through  
diverse communications, including a director  
video interview series and direct communications 
from independent members of our board to  
shareholders. Twice a year, we proactively  
reach out to institutional investors—including  
public pension funds and socially responsible 
investors—about governance and citizenship-
related topics and deliver a summary of  
their feedback to the board. In FY14, these  
engagements reached investors holding over  
30 percent of our outstanding shares. 

Corporate participation in the public policy process is an important and essential 
means of enhancing shareholder value and is fundamental to free and democratic 
societies. We seek to ensure our participation in the political process takes place  
in the light of day and for reasons that are clear and justifiable to our shareholders  
and the public. Our public policy engagement is guided by a publicly available 
Global Public Policy Agenda, which outlines our policy positions on issues core  
to our business.

Microsoft is recognized as a leader for policies  
that ensure the accountability and transparency  
of our engagement in the public policy process. 
During FY14, we received the second highest rating 
in the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political  
Accountability and Disclosure, which is compiled 
annually by the Center for Political Accountability 
and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center  
for Business Ethics Research at the University of 
Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business.

Microsoft has adopted a specific set of Principles 
for Engagement in the Public Policy Process  
in the United States to address issues specific  
to the US political and fundraising system.  
We provide a web page with comprehensive  

disclosure of these policies, disclosure of our  
US political expenditures and contributions, and 
information on our policy-related trade associa-
tion memberships. To uphold our commitment  
to transparency of our political spending and 
contributions, we do not make corporate contribu-
tions to any non-candidate or non-party political  
committees organized under section 527 of  
the Internal Revenue Code, which are formed 
solely to influence elections. We also make no 
independent political expenditures or electioneer-
ing communications, as permitted under the  
US Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling, and we 
inform our trade associations that no Microsoft 
funds may pay for their independent expenditures 
or electioneering communications.

2.5 FY14 Highlights and FY15 Commitments

Progress Against FY14 Commitments

Goal: Maintaining or increasing dialogue between  
stakeholders and the company.  

As described above, we maintained our proactive engagement 
with shareholders, and as described throughout this report, we 
engaged a wide variety of other stakeholders.  

Goal: Engaging in cross-industry forums to help us identify 
and contribute to the development of best practices.  

As we do on an ongoing basis, we engaged with many  
organizations including serving as an industry partner in the 
World Economic Forum Partnering Against Corruption  
Initiative (PACI) and are members of TRACE International and  
the Center for Responsible Enterprise and Trade (CREATe.org).  
We also engage with the Conference Board Governance Center, 
the Council of Institutional Investors, and the Society of  
Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals, among 
other governance-focused organizations. 

Goal: Continuing to enhance our corporate governance 
principles and policies to serve the interests of our  
shareholders and other stakeholders.  

Goal: Implementing the regulatory and disclosure require-
ments adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act.  

The board appointed an independent Chairman, John 
Thompson, coincident with Satya Nadella’s appointment 
as Chief Executive Officer. The board remains focused on 
how the experience and skill set of each individual director 
complements those of their fellow directors to create  
a balanced board with diverse viewpoints, deep expertise,  
and a strong technology-specific knowledge base to  
lead our business into the future. Four independent directors 
joined the board in 2014: Mason Morfit, President of  
ValueAct Capital, John Stanton, a pioneer and innovator  
in the US and global wireless industry, Charles Scharf,  
CEO of Visa, and Teri List-Stoll, Chief Financial Officer of  
Kraft Foods Group. 

We had an active program for responsible sourcing of raw 
materials years before the Dodd-Frank Act’s conflict minerals 
reporting requirements took effect. We have focused on  
our suppliers’ ethical business practices, environmental 
compliance, and worker health and safety. Conflict minerals 
due diligence and reporting is an extension of these efforts,  
to ensure that certain raw materials incorporated in our 
hardware products do not help finance armed conflict and 
human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and adjoining countries. We filed our first Conflict 
Minerals Report in 2014 and we continue to advance  
this work.

FY15 Commitments

•  Maintaining our commitments to ethical business 

practices, with steps to train our employees, to build 
controls to prevent and detect unethical and non-
compliant conduct and, when we identify or learn  
of concerns or improper conduct, to investigate them 
fully and take appropriate actions to remediate. 

•  Maintaining or increase dialogue between stakeholders  

and the company. 

•  Engaging in cross-industry forums to help us identify  
and contribute to the development of best practices.  

•  Continuing to enhance our corporate governance 
principles and policies to serve the interests of our 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 

•  Monitoring and implementing the regulatory and 

disclosure requirements adopted under the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  
(Note: We expect the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to continue to adopt regulations mandated 
by the Dodd-Frank Act. These include disclosure 
of pay ratios, pay for performance, hedging, and 
executive compensation recovery. We have previously 
implemented polices relating to hedging and  
executive compensation recovery and will monitor and 
implement any further requirements in these areas.)

About this Report

3.1 Our Approach

Microsoft provides a dynamic work environment that fosters collaboration  
and inclusion among our diverse and global workforce, which yields exceptional 
personal and professional growth for our employees.

Through Microsoft’s Global Human Rights State-
ment and as a signatory to the UN Global 
Compact, we’re committed to respecting all of  
the human rights described in the Universal  
Declaration of Human Rights; the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the  
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and 
Cultural Rights; and the International Labour  
Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work.1 

1   Those ILO principles are freedom of association and the  

effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;  
elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor;  
effective abolition of child labor; and elimination of  
discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

Microsoft 2014 Citizenship Report

In addition, our commitments to communicate 
respectfully with each other, to provide for diver-
sity and equal employment opportunity at all 
levels of our organization, and to protect the safety 
and health of our employees are incorporated 
into the Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct 
described in the Ethical Business Conduct and 
Governance chapter. 

Microsoft’s global Human Resources team 
advances our policies and programs to recruit, 
retain, and develop exceptional people. This team 
includes groups focused on compensation and 
benefits, talent and organizational capability,  
and diversity and inclusion. In addition to a central 
team, HR professionals are embedded within  
each group in Microsoft to ensure that every 
employee has a clear point of contact and support 
on HR issues, from our executive managers to  
individual contributors.

3.2 Compensation and Benefits

Microsoft offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract the world’s  
best talent in over 100 countries and rewards people for great results. Our Perfor-
mance and Development approach and rewards program applies to Microsoft  
employees globally at every level of the organization to the extent permitted by  
local law. Stock-based compensation is a key component of our rewards programs 
at Microsoft as it provides an ownership stake in the company’s success. Over 85 
percent of Microsoft employees are eligible for an annual stock award. In addition,  
90 percent of Microsoft’s employees are eligible for a cash bonus. Bonuses focus 
on an individual’s business impact over the past year.

We offer a wide assortment of flexible benefits. Due to local law, local conditions, 
and employee preferences, some benefits vary by location, but following is a  
representative sample of the array of benefits we offer:

3.3 Workforce Diversity and Inclusion

For over two decades, our Global Diversity and Inclusion Office has evolved  
and enhanced the company’s diversity and inclusion initiatives to meet the chang-
ing needs of our workforce and our business. As our company embraces a new  
strategy that calls for increased collaboration between individuals and divisions,  
the focus on inclusive behaviors as a way to leverage the diversity of our workforce  
is even more important. The inclusive environment we cultivate helps us retain  
talented employees and foster their advancement, resulting in more innovative 
products and solutions for our customers. 

Building a Pipeline  
of Talent and Leaders 

Measures of success for recruiters within our talent 
and recruiting organizations include meeting 
representation goals. 

As we continue efforts to hire and retain the best 
talent to fuel our growth and innovation, diversity 
is a source of strength for us. Therefore, our  
company is keenly focused on employee recruit-
ment and retention, and career development 
strategies, as they relate to diversity and inclusion.  
We have clear and measurable goals company-
wide to increase global representation of women 
and ethnic minorities in the United States, particu-
larly at more senior levels of the organization.  

We also have a rich history of employee resource 
groups representing large segments of our  
diverse population with whom we have regular 
dialogues around diversity and representation. 
These groups serve as outreach ambassadors  
to their communities on behalf of Microsoft and 
help support important business initiatives— 
from recruiting and retention efforts to marketing 
products and services. 

We have also developed specific programs around 
the acquisition of diverse talent which start with 
our high school internship programs and continue 
with our executive recruiting efforts. The follow-
ing are examples of some of our programs that 
directly address the shortage of diverse students 
graduating with science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM) degrees:   

•  For more than a decade we have championed 
Digigirlz, now part of the Microsoft YouthSpark 
initiative, which gives high school girls 
the opportunity to learn about careers in 
technology, connect with Microsoft employees, 
and participate in hands-on computer and 
technology workshops. Just over 15 months 
ago, we created Codess, which is a community 
for female coders to explore ways to promote 
gender diversity in the engineering field. 

•  Blacks at Microsoft, an employee network, 
hosts an annual Minority Student Day that 
provides local area high school students 
from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds 
with information about the tools, resources, 
and career opportunities that are available 
to them in information technology. It also 

awards scholarships to high school seniors and 
connects recipients with mentors throughout 
their college careers. 

•  Our DisAbility Scholarship at Microsoft was 

created to empower and enable high school 
students with disabilities to go to college  
and target a career in the technology industry.  
The intent is to increase the pool of persons 
living with a disability enrolling in higher 
education and help address unemployment  
as it relates to this demographic.  

•  The Microsoft STEM scholarship for lesbian, 

gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students 
began three years ago. This year our employees 
matched the $20,000 given by Microsoft  
and were able to increase the award to $40,000. 

•  Explore Microsoft is a 12-week summer 

internship program that strives to attract 
women and minorities into technical fields and 
to Microsoft. It is specifically designed to  
expose first- and second-year college students 
to software development and encourage 
students to pursue degrees in this and other 
related fields of study.

3.3 Workforce Diversity and Inclusion

Through these and other programs, we have 
reached thousands of diverse students around  
the world, supporting them in their pursuit of 
technical careers. 

While much work remains to be done, we are 
pleased that FY14 marked a year of continued 
progress in increasing the diversity of our work-
force and leadership, including: 

•  Growing the percentage of women in our 
global workforce from 24 to 28 percent; 

• 

Increasing the percentage of Microsoft  
senior executive women and minorities from  
22 to 27 percent; 

•  Raising the percentage of women and 

minorities on the Microsoft Board of Directors 
from 33 to 40 percent.

Building an Inclusive  
and Engaging Culture

Maximizing the contribution of every individual 
allows us to infuse diverse thought as a natural 
part of the way we innovate. With that in mind,  
we value accountability and learning as key  
ingredients to nurturing an inclusive culture. 

Over the last three years, we have incorporated  
a Global Diversity and Inclusion Leadership  
Commitment in the business priorities of more 
than 16,963 Microsoft people managers.  
This commitment, which is tied to overall perfor-
mance and compensation, helps ensure that  
our people and talent development processes 
include a focus on diversity.  

We also routinely apply our Diversity and Inclusion 
Maturity Model Assessment across our teams  
to help evaluate their engagement, progress,  
and opportunities related to diversity and  
inclusion issues. As our organizational structure  
changes, we will work with each new team  
to complete an assessment in an effort to ensure  
that diversity and inclusion are infused into our 
refined business strategy. 

16,963

2,300

We pioneered a Global Diversity and 
Inclusion Leadership Commitment in 
FY12 to help ensure that our leaders 
prioritize people and support talent 
management planning.

In FY13, this commitment 
was incorporated into the 
business objectives of more 
than 2,300 Microsoft leaders.

In FY14, we significantly increased 
the scope of this commitment by 
infusing it into the objectives of 
our 16,963 people managers.

Using data from our annual employee poll, we 
developed our first-ever “Diversity and Inclu-
sion Index” that allowed us to begin to identify 
additional opportunities to further develop our 
company in areas related to culture, diversity,  
and inclusion. 

We have a robust portfolio of diversity and inclu-
sion training courses for all levels of employees 
and leaders around the world. Key courses include 
“Managing InclusionTM,” “Building an Inclusive  
Culture: Understanding Conscious and Uncon-
scious Bias,” “CulturalDexterityTM,” and “Consulting 
for Diversity Hiring,” developed specifically for  

our international HR and staffing teams focused  
on gender diversity. 

Our continued investment in diversity and inclu-
sion learning and development offerings resulted 
in an expansion of our “Wired for Success:  
Career Strategies” program globally with 1,309 
women participating across 8 countries, as well 
as with a new US-based program specifically 
designed for racial minorities. A key emphasis of 
the program is highlighting career opportunities  
at Microsoft, while helping attendees build their 
networks and grow the skills necessary for more 
senior individual contributor or leadership roles.

3.4 Training and Development

We offer a diverse range of learning and development opportunities including  
trainings available in the classroom, online, and through videos, mobile apps,  
podcasts, and other formats in multiple languages to meet the learning needs of  
our employees around the world. We believe training is not limited to formal  
instruction and our training philosophy focuses on providing the right learning,  
at the right time, in the right way. 

Throughout the year, employees get coaching on 
career development through meetings with their 
manager. Managers receive training to enhance 
their skills in coaching and mentoring employees 
on how to achieve the greatest impact, as well 
as how to drive their own career development, 
providing tools and resources to support focused 
and actionable conversations. 

With training opportunities ranging from class-
room modules to peer-to-peer mentoring,  
no one metric captures the breadth of learning  
available to Microsoft employees, but globally  
we have found that:

•  92 percent of all employees were satisfied with 
the knowledge they gained and could apply to 
their job immediately with our formal training. 

•  Our employees spent an average of 30 hours in 

formal training.  

•  We helped 16,776 managers globally enhance 
their management skills through online and 
classroom-based manager trainings. 

We invest significantly in our employees’ career 
development, provide on-the-job “stretch” 
opportunities for advancement, and offer frequent 
promotion opportunities, all of which are founda-
tional to our culture.

3.5 Employee Wellness and Occupational Health and Safety

Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being with  
comprehensive benefits to help employees maximize their physical, financial,  
and social wellness, including:

•  The Microsoft Ergonomics Program, offering 

employees ergonomic assessment and training 
programs and special furniture, equipment,  
and software for medical needs. 

•  Healthy dining options including a new  
Real Easy Wellness labeling system used  
in all Microsoft cafes with color coding  
to flag healthier and less healthy options. 

•  The Microsoft CARES employee assistance 
program, offering free access to services 
including personal and family counseling, stress 
management, and referrals for child/elder care. 

•  Access for Microsoft employees and their 
dependents to weight management,  
tobacco cessation, and chronic disease 
management programs. 

•  Fitness benefits that fund gym memberships 

or fitness-related equipment and activities and 
onsite recreational and fitness opportunities. 

•  Free onsite “Know Your Numbers” health 

screening events providing employees and  
their adult dependents with screening for risks  
of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol,  
and high blood pressure as well as onsite  
mammography screenings. 

•  An onsite health clinic at our Redmond, 

Washington headquarters campus, offering 
comprehensive health and wellness services 
and clinics at some other locations. 

In addition to our wellness programs, Microsoft’s 
Health and Safety program integrates appropri-
ate safety and health practices into our operations 
and works for continual improvement in employee 
health and safety. As part of this commitment, 
health and safety professionals assess the safety 
risks of Microsoft work activities and engage  
with workers and management to implement  
safe work practices, hazard controls, and training 
to minimize safety risks. They also assess new  
workspaces as they are constructed to ensure 
sound design-for-safety principles are followed  
and existing workspaces periodically to ensure 
needed controls are implemented effectively.  
Microsoft also involves employees and managers 
in Health and Safety Committees specific to  
our datacenters, retail operations, and at our  
US manufacturing facility.

In FY14, we revised our required new employee  
orientation training to update the safety and 
health information given to all new employees.  
We also deployed an updated online safety  
training tool to deliver safety training to those 
workers in higher hazard work environments  
and last year offered 42 different online and  
in-person safety course modules.

In FY14, our metrics for occupational injuries  
and illnesses were comparable to or less than 
injury-illness rates from other companies  
with similar operations. Our US facilities had  
an Injury-Incident Rate of 0.14 and a Lost-Day  
Rate of 0.02 (our 12-month rolling average  
for July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2014) based on US  
OSHA rules for recordkeeping).

3.6 FY14 Highlights and FY15 Commitments

Progress Against FY14 Commitments

FY15 Commitments

Goal: Advancing efforts to increase the diversity of our  
talent, with a focus on senior-level positions.  

In FY14 we increased the percentage of Microsoft senior 
executive women and minorities from 22 to 27 percent  
and raised the percentage of women and minorities on  
the Microsoft Board of Directors from 33 to 40 percent.

Goal: Continuing to employ a variety of reward programs 
to reinforce our high performing culture while  
adjusting our approach to performance and rewards,  
as needed, in response to employee feedback and  
evolving business needs.  

We describe our rewards program above. In FY14, we made 
significant changes to our Performance and Development 
approach to help drive our One Microsoft culture of working 
together and to inform our annual rewards. We rolled out 
these changes globally to the extent permitted by local law.

Goal: Offering industry-leading health care in the US  
with no employee premiums and continuing to provide 
multi-modal educational materials to teach employees  
and their dependents how to optimize their health care 
and overall wellness.  

We continue to provide educational and support materials 
to our employees to help them make informed health care 
decisions. We also continue to invest in preventative and  
life optimizing wellness programs – for both our employees 
and in many cases their families as well.

Goal: Creating learning opportunities to increase employ-
ees’ capabilities and skills, enabling them to deliver

Our Citizenship and Public Affairs team develops  
and coordinates global strategies that are imple-
mented through local citizenship teams and 
nonprofit partners to meet unique local needs and 
conditions. We focus our corporate philanthropy 
on two strategic areas that align with our busi-
ness and where we can contribute our skills and 
resources to create meaningful impact: 1) investing 
in the future of our communities by empowering 
youth with greater access to technology educa-
tion and skills training to help them reach their full 
potential; and 2) donating technology to nonprofit 
organizations so they can do even more good for 
the people they serve. 

As a complement to our focused approach to our 
corporate philanthropy, our flexible volunteer and 
employee giving programs enable employees to 
support the causes they choose with donations of 
time, expertise, money, and software. Our employ-
ees regularly tell us a key factor behind their choice 
to work at Microsoft is knowing their personal 
commitment to philanthropy will be honored, 
encouraged, and matched. 

We are pleased to report that in FY14 our total 
annual giving surpassed $1 billion for the first time.

4.2 Microsoft YouthSpark

Microsoft YouthSpark is a global company-wide initiative to leverage the power of 
technology to connect youth around the world with education, employment, and  
entrepreneurship opportunities. We launched YouthSpark in 2012 with the specific 
goal of creating opportunities for 300 million youth by 2015. We are on track  
to surpass that goal, having created opportunities for 227 million youth to date,  
including 124 million youth in FY14.

In developing Microsoft YouthSpark, we consulted 
with government, nonprofit, and business leaders 
globally to understand the challenges young 
people face in building their lives and contributing 
to their communities. This work highlighted the 
need to go beyond addressing the “digital divide” 
and to take a more holistic approach to address 
the opportunity divide – the gap between those 
who have the skills, access, and opportunities to be 
successful and those who do not.  

To help close the opportunity gap for millions  
of youth around the world, Microsoft YouthSpark 
combines our philanthropic contributions to 
several hundred youth-serving nonprofit orga-
nizations globally with more than 30 Microsoft 
programs, products, and services and makes  

this package of resources easily accessible through  
our Microsoft YouthSpark Hub. The following  
are just a few of the programs offered on the 
YouthSpark Hub.  

Office 365 for EDU:  
Office 365 is free for all students and teachers 
around the world and provides ready access  
to technology tools that power learning and  
collaboration: email, instant messaging, group 
video and voice chat, and online document 
viewing and editing. 

Skype in the Classroom:  
Skype in the Classroom creates a free, global  
community for teachers to connect their students 
with other students and guest speakers from 
around the world.  

Computer Science Education – TEALS:  
To increase access for young people to learn 
computer science, Microsoft created TEALS  
(Technology Education and Literacy in Schools), 
which places Microsoft employee volunteers  
in high school classrooms across the United States 
to partner with local faculty to teach both basic 
and advanced coding and programming skills.  

Imagine Cup:  
Microsoft’s global youth technology competition 
challenges students to apply their knowledge and 
passion to develop technical solutions for social 
impact, engaging games, and driving innovation. 

DreamSpark:  
Free access to Microsoft designer and developer 
tools is provided to high school and college 
students and their educators to support computer 
science education around the world. 

BizSpark:  
Software startups are given access to Microsoft 
software development tools and connections  
with key industry players, including investors, to 
help young entrepreneurs start a new business. 

YouthSpark on GlobalGiving:  
Microsoft has partnered with GlobalGiving.org to 
create a fundraising platform that gives individuals 
a direct and easy way to support young people in 
their quest for training, education, job placement, 
and entrepreneurship opportunities.

4.3 Technology for Good 

Microsoft helps build nonprofits’ capacity to use technology to be more efficient,  
effective, and innovative in doing their important work. In FY14 we donated more 
than $948.6 million worth of software and hardware to more than 86,000 nonprofit 
organizations around the world. 

We also host NGO Connection Days around the 
globe for nonprofit organizations to learn how 
technology can help them become more efficient 
and effective in their work. In FY14, Microsoft  
collaborated with nonprofits by hosting 45 NGO 
Connection Days in 35 countries. Through our 
Solutions for Good program, we provide  
applications that Microsoft and our employees 
have developed for our own Corporate Citizenship 
programs to nonprofits to help them advance  
their missions. 

In FY14, we enhanced our software donations with 
the launch of Office 365 for Nonprofits in 92 
countries. The program provides nonprofits with 
free access to Microsoft’s latest Office cloud service, 
which includes anywhere access to Microsoft  
Office applications and professional email, calendar,  
instant messaging (IM), and web conferencing 
tools. The offering allows nonprofits’ employees 
and strategic volunteers access to Office applica-
tions and documents anywhere across multiple  
devices; enables easy collaboration through 
content sharing; and offers efficient administrative 
controls so organizations can spend less time and 
resources on IT maintenance. Through this  
program in FY14 we donated $55 million worth  
of Office 365 subscriptions, providing licenses  
for 1.5 million employees and strategic volunteers 
at nearly 11,500 nonprofits around the world.

4.4 Humanitarian and Disaster Response

In times of disaster, and to prepare for those times, Microsoft and our partners  
contribute resources and technology solutions to assist governments and humani-
tarian organizations in their emergency response efforts. Microsoft’s Global  
Disaster Response Team includes experts from Microsoft Operations, Services,  
and Citizenship and Public Affairs to quickly deploy Microsoft technologies and 
technical assistance to customers, communities, governments, and nonprofits  
in the wake of natural disasters. The team also works to help organizations make 
technology systems more resilient to proactively prepare for disasters. We also  
help governments and nonprofits quickly identify and deploy the right technology 
to address the unique needs of a disaster situation. 

In FY14, Microsoft provided support to address 
disasters around the world, including flooding  
in the Balkans and Colorado and a major earth-
quake and typhoons in the Philippines. Also in 
FY14, we launched HelpBridge Version 2.0, the 
next generation of our free disaster response 
mobile app that provides an easy way for peo-
ple to contact friends and family, donate cash 
and goods to relief agencies, and volunteer time 
in the aftermath of a natural disaster such as an 
earthquake or hurricane. HelpBridge 2.0 lets 
users simultaneously send status updates to pre-
selected groups of emergency contacts via email, 
SMS, Facebook, and Twitter. It also provides an 
option to share GPS coordinates, depending  
on device capabilities, so others can locate the  
sender in case of an emergency. HelpBridge  
is available for Windows Phone, Android,  
and iPhone.  

We have more information online about our 
Disaster Response Program including a report  
of our FY14 activities and upcoming priorities.

4.5 Employee Giving and Volunteerism 

The foundation of all of our efforts to serve  
communities is the passion of our employees.  
Our employee giving benefits vary around  
the world. Outside the US, employees can take  
up to 3 paid days off work to volunteer. In the US,  
our Employee Giving Program matches  
employees’ gifts of money and time to nonprofits. 
In FY14, we enhanced the US Employee Giving  
Program by increasing the annual matching funds 
available to each employee from $12,000 to  
$15,000. We also reduced the number of hours 
employees need to volunteer to qualify for a  
matching donation. When employees volunteer  
at least 4 hours in the community, Microsoft 
donates $17 per hour to the eligible organizations 
they serve. In FY14, 66 percent of Microsoft’s  
US employees participated in the Employee  
Giving Program.

4.6 FY14 Highlights and FY15 Commitments

Progress Against FY14 Commitments

Goal: Empowering an additional 100 million youth  
to imagine and realize their full potential through  
Microsoft YouthSpark.  

In FY14 we exceeded this target, reaching 124 million youth 
with YouthSpark programs. 

Goal: Continuing to evolve and grow the Microsoft Youth-
Spark Hub, where young people can explore and access 
all the youth-focused services, programs, and resources 
provided by Microsoft.  

We launched a major revamp of the YouthSpark Hub in 
FY14 to provide a more dynamic, engaging user experience 
specifically designed to help young people find the resources 
from Microsoft that will be most valuable for them and the 
future path they choose to pursue.  

Goal: Continuing to evolve and grow Give for Youth,  
a micro-giving portal that helps individuals fund  
and follow the aspirations of youth around the world.  

We transitioned Give for Youth from a standalone portal to 
a partnership with GlobalGiving, which supported 95,432 
youth with donations in FY14.  

Goal: Continuing to evolve Innovate for Good, a global 
online community that encourages and enables youth to 
collaborate, inspire, and support each other’s ideas for 
social change.  

We evolved the Innovate for Good program into YouthSpark 
Live, a series of global events that help young people identify

a path they want to pursue for their future, understand the 
resources Microsoft has to assist them along the way, and 
move forward with a clear action plan and next steps to get 
them closer to making that future a reality.  

Goal: Launching the full Office 365 for Nonprofits program 
in up to 90 countries.  

We launched the Office 365 for Nonprofits program in 92 
countries in FY14 and donated $55 million worth of  
Office 365 subscriptions, providing licenses for 1.5 million 
employees and strategic volunteers at nearly 11,500 NGOs.  

Goal: Continuing expansion of access to the Microsoft 
Software Donation Program with a goal of 80,000  
organizations in FY14.  

We donated software and services to more than 86,000 
nonprofit organizations in FY14. 

Goal: Supporting the development and distribution of 
three to five technology solutions for nonprofits.  

We launched HelpBridge 2.0 this year, We also provided 
Translators without Borders, Benetech, and Caravan Studios 
with cash, software, and Azure access through a Solutions 
for Good RFP to develop technology solutions focused on 
problems related to youth and opportunity, STEM education, 
disaster response, human rights, and civic engagement. 

Goal: Creating a community of excellence within  
Microsoft to better engage and support nonprofit  
technology initiatives and solutions.  

We have an increasingly active community of approximately 
450 engineers and others from across Microsoft engaged in 
Technology for Good projects and communications channels, 
including a dedicated email list and Yammer group.  

Goal: Working with community partners to support  
the evolution of hackathons and community-driven  
solutions for good.  

Microsoft is partnering with Caravan Studios to hold six “app 
generator workshops” that bring together issue experts and 
technology experts to help define how technology can play a 
role in addressing specific issues such as food security, safety, 
and human rights.  

Goal: Continuing to expand and enhance our employee 
programs to excite and encourage record levels  
of employee and alumni giving and volunteering.  

We reached a new record for participation by employees  
in the US Employee Giving Campaign with 7,144 registered 
volunteers (nearly 12 percent of the US workforce)  
and $112.2 million in employee contributions (including 
Microsoft’s match).  

Goal: Sharing our technology with other corporations  
and working with leaders to help scale giving and skills-
based volunteering.  

In FY14 we worked with Boeing and the NGO TechSoup  
Global to launch Volunteer Manager. This was a volunteer 
matching tool developed internally at Microsoft for our own 
employee programs that we are now making available to 
companies of all sizes. We’ve also involved volunteers from 
over 100 companies in our TEALS computer science program.

About this Report

5.1 Our Approach

Microsoft’s commitment to human rights is embedded in our mission of helping 
people and businesses realize their full potential. We work to ensure that we respect 
human rights across all aspects of our business and we seek to apply the power of 
technology to promote human rights globally. 

Since endorsing the UN Global Compact in 2006, 
Microsoft has had a formal commitment to  
respecting all of the human rights enumerated in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;  
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights; and ILO Declaration on Fundamen-
tal Principles and Rights at Work. Across our  
business we have a wide range of policies,  
practices, and programs that relate to human 
rights, including data privacy and security,  
free expression, labor rights in our workforce and  
our supply chain, and equality and diversity.

Building on these fundamental commitments, 
Microsoft was among the first companies to  
align our human rights work with the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights  
released in 2011.  

Microsoft’s Global Human Rights Statement 
articulates our human rights commitments in 
line with the framework of the Guiding Principles, 
including issues related to governance, due dili-
gence, and remediation. Microsoft details how  
we meet each of the Guiding Principles in a sepa-
rate document posted here on our Corporate 
Citizenship website. 

In 2014 we incorporated our human rights 
commitments into our Standards of Business 
Conduct, which all employees receive and must 
complete annually (described in depth in  
the Ethical Business Conduct and Governance 
chapter). Our human rights commitments  
are also covered in a range of role-specific  
trainings tailored to particular business functions.  

In 2013, we launched the Microsoft Technology 
and Human Rights Center to prioritize  
and coordinate human rights due diligence, 
identify emerging risks and opportunities related 
to human rights, and promote harmonized 
approaches to human rights across Microsoft.  
The Center also works to foster dialogue to 
advance understanding of the human rights 
impacts of information and communications 
technology (ICT). Through the Center, Microsoft 
engages with a broad range of human rights 
groups, academics, and industry groups  
globally to share Microsoft’s experiences and 
lessons learned. Among its activities in FY14,  
the Center has: 

•  Hosted a series of roundtables in Brussels,  

Berlin, San Francisco and Singapore with human 
rights defenders, policy makers, academics, 
and other experts and groups to help us bet-
ter understand how ICT companies can engage 
most effectively and responsibly with stake-
holders on human rights and identify the rights 
holders directly impacted by ICT companies. 

•  Held an “app generator” workshop to learn 

from human rights defenders about the tech-
nology applications and tools they need to  
help them meet their responsibilities to those  
at risk for human rights abuse. 

•  Convened a range of events including round-
tables at the World Economic Forum Annual 
Meeting in Davos on LGBT equality and on 
government surveillance and meetings with 
institutional investors and corporate lawyers  
to raise awareness and understanding of the 
UN Guiding Principles.

5.2 Privacy and Data Security

Microsoft has a longstanding commitment to ensuring the privacy and security of 
our customers’ data. We have a strong set of Privacy Principles and practices that 
apply company-wide. We incorporate privacy considerations into our design  
and development processes, offer our customers meaningful privacy choices, and  
responsibly manage and protect the customer data that we store. We’ve led  
our industry with privacy protections such as the “Do Not Track” feature turned  
on by default in Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and with our commitment not to scan 
Outlook or other email services for purposes of targeting online advertising.  
In recognition of our privacy protections, in April 2014 Microsoft became the first 
company to receive approval from the European Union (EU)’s 28 data protection 
authorities affirming that our enterprise cloud contracts meet EU privacy standards.  

Revelations about government surveillance prac-
tices put a spotlight on online privacy throughout 
FY14. In response, we instituted new measures to 
ensure we continue to meet our commitments 
to data privacy and security and earn customers’ 
trust. This included expanding our use of encryp-
tion across our services, providing choice and 
transparency on data location, and strengthening 
legal protections for customers. Both on our own 
and in collaboration with others in our industry, 
Microsoft is pushing for reform in government 
surveillance practices. We fought for and won the 

right to increase our disclosure on the volume 
of national security orders for customer data we 
receive from the US government.  

Over the past year, some media reports included 
erroneous information on how governments can 
access data from Microsoft. Prior to those allega-
tions and again in response to them, Microsoft 
has categorically stated that we do not provide 
any government with direct and unfettered access 
to our customers’ data, and we don’t provide 
any back doors. As we’ve publicly disclosed, if a 

government wants our customers’ data, it must 
serve us with the appropriate warrant, court order, 
or subpoena targeted at specific accounts and 
identifiers. We reject requests that don’t meet 
these requirements, and we only provide the data 
specified in the legal order.  

In keeping with our longstanding commitment  
to transparency, we publish a semi-annual  
Law Enforcement Requests Report and clearly 
outline our well-documented practices for 
responding to government demands for customer 
data. The report includes the number of demands 
we receive and the number of accounts or  
identifiers that may be affected by these demands.  
We also provide details on the number of 
demands we complied with and, if we complied, 
whether we provided content or non-content  
data. In addition, as a result of a concerted effort 
by Microsoft and our industry partners, we are 
now permitted to publish data about the  
number of legal demands we receive from the  
US government pursuant to national security laws.

Global Network Initiative

5.4

Working to Protect the Rights  
of Vulnerable Populations

Microsoft is a founding member and sits on the board of the Global Network  
Initiative (GNI), a collaborative effort between ICT companies, human rights groups, 
socially responsible investors, and others. GNI provides a set of Principles and  
Implementation Guidelines regarding practical steps and policies ICT companies 
can adopt to respect and advance the freedom of expression and privacy rights  
of their users when faced with governmental demands.  

Microsoft works to help protect people of all ages and abilities against a broad 
range of risks, including malware, online hoaxes, and online bullying. To promote 
the safer use of Microsoft devices and online services, we include a range of safety 
features including family safety settings. We also have strong prohibitions against 
abusive behavior on our online services in our Terms of Use, which are enforced by 
complaint response teams on services such as Xbox LIVE.  

The GNI provides for a series of independent  
assessments that review in increasing depth how 
its member companies are implementing the  
GNI Principles. During FY14, Microsoft completed 
the GNI Phase III Assessment, which is conducted  
by an independent assessor accredited by the  
GNI Board. The independent assessor reviews the  
policies and procedures adopted by the company 
in accordance with the GNI guidelines and  
looks at how the policies and procedures were 
implemented in real-world cases. Based on the 
results of this assessment and engagement with  
Microsoft, the GNI Board determined that  
Microsoft is compliant with the GNI Principles.  
The assessment found that the systems,  
policies, and procedures that Microsoft relies  
upon to implement the GNI Principles are both 

mature and subject to ongoing review with an 
eye to continuous improvement. The GNI’s public 
report on the results of its Phase III company  
assessments is available online. 

As part of our commitment to GNI, Microsoft  
has independent experts in business and  
human rights conduct Human Rights Impact 
Assessments (HRIAs) of specific parts of our  
business. The HRIAs include independent research, 
internal interviews, and engagement with  
external stakeholders to identify relevant human 
rights risks and opportunities for specific  
Microsoft products, services, business relation-
ships, and markets. 

We promote online safety broadly across the 
Internet as well. One key resource we bring to  
this effort is the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit,  
an international legal and technical team of more 
than 100 attorneys, investigators, and forensic 
analysts around the globe. The Digital Crimes 
Unit focuses on technology-facilitated child 
sexual exploitation crimes, piracy and intellectual 
property crimes, and malicious software crimes, 
particularly botnet-driven Internet attacks. 

Five years ago, Microsoft working with Dartmouth 
College developed PhotoDNA, a technology tool 
to help refine and automate the search for child 
pornography among the billions of photos on the 
Internet. We use PhotoDNA to help disrupt the 
spread of child pornography through Microsoft’s 
Bing, OneDrive, and Outlook.com services.  

We also donated the PhotoDNA technology to  
the National Center for Missing & Exploited  
Children. PhotoDNA has now become the industry 
standard for combating child pornography  
online used by NGOs, law enforcement, and other 
leading Internet companies like Facebook. 

Microsoft is now applying our experience address-
ing technology-facilitated crime to advance the 
fight against human trafficking. Microsoft has 
funded foundational research on the role technol-
ogy plays in facilitating human trafficking in  
order to identify technologies and measures to 
counter it. We work with law enforcement agencies 
and a variety of public-private initiatives to  
address human trafficking with groups such as the  
UN Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking.

development. This commitment starts with offering people access to technology  
in a language familiar to them that respects linguistic and cultural distinctions  
and helps sustain diverse local languages and cultures. Through the Microsoft Local 
Language Program, Microsoft collaborates with local governments, language  
authorities, universities, and NGOs to provide individuals access to computing in 
their native language. The local language program supports more than 108  
languages, covering 4.5 billion speakers around the planet. Under the program,  
Microsoft provides a range of language and translation tools and resources,  
including free Language Interface Packs to make Windows and Office  
applications available in local languages ranging from Albanian to Yoruba. 

In addition, Microsoft seeks to ensure our technol-
ogy is accessible to the more than 1 billion people 
around the world with a disability. The Microsoft 
Accessibility Standard is a company-wide  
policy that drives consideration for accessibility  
into the design, development, evaluation,  
and release of all of our products and services. 
Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, Xbox,  
and our other products and services include  

accessibility features and controls such as the Ease 
of Access Center in Windows 8. Beyond its own 
accessibility features, Microsoft Office 2013 includes 
an Accessibility Checker that helps users enhance 
the accessibility of their documents and presenta-
tions. We’ve found that many of our accessibility 
innovations and features allow us to deliver more 
flexible user experiences that benefit a wide range 
of our customers, not just those with disabilities. 

Microsoft offers guidance on accessibility to our 
users, with accessibility information available in 
over 40 languages. Microsoft Customer Support 
provides a dedicated support desk for custom-
ers who have disabilities or who are looking for 
support when also using assistive technology,  
such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and 
speech recognition commands. We provide  
guidance to help users address a broad range  
of disabilities including:  

•  Vision impairments 

•  Dexterity and mobility impairments 

•  Hearing impairments 

•  Learning impairments 

•  Language and communication impairments 

•  Age-related impairments 

We are continually working to raise the aware-
ness of accessibility issues in the technology 
industry. The Microsoft Accessibility Developer 
Center provides guidance, tools, and technologies 
for developing accessible applications and web 
content. Our tools and guides help governments, 
schools, businesses, and organizations integrate 
technology for individuals with disabilities.  
Microsoft Research and product teams also  
collaborate with disability experts to unlock new 
uses for technologies that can dramatically 
benefit the disabled, such as helping paralyzed 
individuals communicate with their families using 
eye gaze technology and speech synthesizers  
on the Microsoft Surface. For more information

FY14 Highlights and FY15 Commitments

Progress Against FY14 Commitments

FY15 Commitments

Goal: Increasing our commitment to transparency by 
issuing a Law Enforcement Requests Report.  

Goal: Continuing to meet Microsoft human rights commit-
ments as outlined in our Global Human Rights Statement. 

In March 2013, Microsoft began publishing details of the 
number of demands we receive each year in our Law 
Enforcement Requests Report, which we update every six 
months. During FY14, we also gained permission to begin 
publishing data about the number of legal demands we 
receive from the US government pursuant to national 
security laws that will also be updated every six months.  

Goal: Collaborating with privacy stakeholders from around 
the world to generate new thinking in support of evolved 
approaches and models to protect privacy.  

Microsoft has taken a leadership role along with others in 
our industry to advocate for new international standards 
and reforms of government surveillance practices. In FY14, 
Microsoft also collaborated with a number of leading privacy 
experts to advance dialogue models to protect privacy 
through the release of multi-stakeholder recommendations  
on Data Protection Principles for the 21st Century.  

Goal: Developing and deploying technology solutions and 
applications to advance human rights.  

Microsoft has worked with a range of human rights organiza-
tions and advocates to better understand their technology 
needs to protect and advance human rights, including  
hosting a human rights-focused “app generator” workshop.  
Microsoft has also worked with the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and has plans to deepen  
this work.  

Microsoft 2014 Citizenship Report

We recognize that meeting our human rights commitments  
is an ongoing process and there is much work still to do.  
We do feel we made significant progress in FY14 in areas  
such as increasing the amount of information we share 
about how we respond to law enforcement requests and 
US national security requests for customer information and 
in completing an independent assessment of Microsoft’s 
implementation of the GNI Principles on Freedom of  
Expression and Privacy. 

Goal: Advancing public understanding of the human  
rights impacts of ICT through the work of the Microsoft 
Technology and Human Rights Center.  

The Microsoft Technology and Human Rights Center con-
vened events around the globe in FY14 to advance discussion 
of topics ranging from how ICT companies define rights 
holders to addressing issues of government surveillance.  

Goal: Advancing internal targeted human rights trainings.  

Under our GNI commitments and Principle 16 of the  
UN Guiding Principles, we provided human rights training 
opportunities to our Legal and Corporate Affairs  
teams, Government Affairs field, and Citizenship leads  
globally. We enhanced our mandatory training on our GNI  
commitments for all of our privacy managers and  
others receiving government requests related to online 
content and customer information. We also incorporated  
relevant human rights content into mandatory  
compliance training for our worldwide sales organization, 
including those who lead public sector sales and develop-
ment of business partnerships.

Goal: Creating a center of excellence and focus of accessi-
bility across Microsoft engineering and marketing groups. 

We launched the Accessibility Leadership Team that meets 
quarterly to track progress on and inspire innovations for 
customers with disabilities.  

Goal: Performing ongoing assessment of the human rights 
impacts of our operations. 

Goal: Establishing accessibility as a globally recognized and 
respected profession.  

In addition to our own ongoing reviews of how we are 
meeting our human rights commitments, in FY14 we con-
tracted with outside experts to conduct HRIAs of significant 
areas of our operations that are consistent with Principle 18 
of the UN Guiding Principles on human rights assessments.  

Microsoft took an active part in the creation of the first 
International Association for Accessibility Professionals as 
a founding member and our Chief Accessibility Officer is 
the current President of the Board. Over 1,100 individual 
members from 35 countries have joined the organization.  

•  Continuing to review our policies and practices to ensure 
we are meeting our commitments to human rights  
and to perform ongoing assessments of the human rights 
impacts of our operations.  

•  Continuing to advance human rights trainings to 

targeted internal groups within Microsoft.  

•  Finalizing a Memorandum of Understanding with the 

Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights  
to enhance its use of technology. 

•  Engaging external stakeholders and human rights 

defenders to identify opportunities to use technology 
to defend and advance human rights, including work 
to apply the power of technology to disrupt human 
trafficking. 

•  Collaborating with the GNI to enhance the resources 
available to help ICT companies assess freedom of 
expression and privacy impacts. 

•  Advancing awareness of Microsoft’s accessible  

products and services to meet the needs of K-12 students 
with disabilities. 

•  Supporting and advancing the implementation of the  

UN Convention for the Rights of People with Disabilities.

Our Approach

Microsoft requires all suppliers doing business with us to uphold the ethical  
business, employment, environmental, and worker safety practices prescribed  
in our Supplier Code of Conduct—which aligns with the Electronic Industry  
Citizenship Coalition’s (EICC’s) responsible supply chain standards. We’ve also  
committed to addressing those issues for the raw materials incorporated into our  
products. We apply risk-based approaches for the responsible management  
of all of our suppliers, focusing deeply on our hardware and packaging suppliers.  
We also work collaboratively with our suppliers on proactive initiatives to  
positively impact their workers, the communities in which they operate, and their  
own businesses.

Social and Environmental  
Accountability in Our Hardware  
Supply Chain

Our hardware business has grown steadily since 1982 and has accelerated in the past 
several years.1 Our Manufacturing and Supply Chain Group manages our hardware 
and packaging supply chain, which spans 17 countries around the world. We publish 
annually a list of our top 100 production suppliers for our commercially available 
hardware products.

1   In April 2014, Microsoft acquired the Nokia Devices and Services business, which became Microsoft Mobile Oy (MMO), and expanded our supply 
     chain to include mobile device production. This report focuses on Microsoft’s supply chain management activities outside of the Nokia Devices 
     and Services acquisition. Since the acquisition, we have been evaluating and aligning our principles, policies, and activities within the Microsoft 
     Devices Group and its suppliers and working to integrate the data that will be presented in our FY15 Microsoft Citizenship Report. For the current 

reporting year, information about MMO’s supply chain sustainability efforts are detailed in the Nokia People and Planet Report 2013.

6.2 Social and Environmental Accountability  

in Our Hardware Supply Chain

The Manufacturing and Supply Chain Group estab-
lished the Social and Environmental Accountability 
(SEA) program in 2005 to ensure that our hardware 
and packaging suppliers conform to our Supplier 
Code of Conduct and additional hardware-related 
requirements for living conditions, safe working 
practices, and environmental, health and safety  
protection. These requirements are incorporated 
into our contracts with Tier 1 suppliers that  
manufacture our hardware components and prod-
ucts and Tier 2 suppliers contracted by Microsoft  
to provide components and/or materials to our  
Tier 1 suppliers. We also require these suppliers to 
address the issues covered in our SEA specifications 
with their own upstream and downstream suppli-
ers—those that Microsoft does not contract with 
directly. Microsoft’s factory and sourcing managers 
are held accountable for SEA performance and 
work in partnership with Microsoft’s SEA team of 
experts on labor rights and environment, health, 
and safety practices.

SEA Supplier  
Engagement Approach

Our SEA program continues to raise the bar with 
our existing suppliers while onboarding new 
suppliers to our SEA requirements. All hardware 
and packaging suppliers that Microsoft directly 
contracts with undergo qualification assessments 
to ensure they meet our SEA standards. Before we 
start doing business together, all Tier 1 and  
high- and medium-risk Tier 2 suppliers undergo 
initial capability assessments and audits conducted  
by third-party auditors and/or members of  
Microsoft’s SEA team. Once these suppliers are 
onboard, we share with them a scorecard that 
grades each factory on its conformance with our 
SEA requirements.

6.2 Social and Environmental Accountability  

in Our Hardware Supply Chain

Third-party auditors review our Tier 1 suppliers at 
least annually and audit our Tier 2 suppliers based 
on their risk level. Microsoft’s SEA team supple-
ments these third-party audits with regular onsite 
assessments of Tier 1 factories and high- and 
medium-risk Tier 2 component suppliers.  

Third-party auditors and the Microsoft SEA team 
use audit protocols and tools developed by  
the EICC that we supplement with additional  
criteria on environmental protection, ethics, worker 
health and safety, and management systems. 
During the review process, auditors examine docu-
mentation; visit production lines, dorms, canteens, 
and waste storage facilities; and conduct face- 
to-face interviews of workers and factory  
management. To ensure consistency and quality  
of third-party audits, in FY14 we developed a  
qualification program for third-party auditors  
that includes shadow audits and assessments of 
onsite audit performance and audit reports.  

When auditors or our SEA team find non-confor-
mances with our standards, our SEA team works 
closely with suppliers on corrective action plans  
to resolve issues, including building needed  
capabilities. Suppliers are required to identify  

Microsoft 2014 Citizenship Report

the root cause, the corrective course of action, and  
preventive actions for all of the issues found.  
Suppliers must correct issues within specific dead-
lines based on the severity of the nonconformance 
found to avoid restrictions on new Microsoft  
business or being given notice that they risk termi-
nation of our business. 

We also partnered with a China-based NGO  
to pilot a worker hotline for our suppliers.  
Among the goals of the hotline is to provide an 
external channel that will encourage workers  
to raise and discuss concerns relating to general 
working conditions and conformance to  
the Microsoft Supplier Code of Conduct.  
We piloted this program with four of our eight  
Tier 1 factories in FY14 and plan to evaluate  
results and roll it out to additional Tier 1 factories  
in FY15.  

SEA Audit and  
Assessment Findings

In FY14, we completed 217 third-party audits  
and Microsoft assessments of 131 Tier 1 and high- 
and medium-risk Tier 2 suppliers. In this report,  
we disclose all findings of critical/serious non-
conformance with our requirements. All of these 
critical/serious findings were escalated to Microsoft 
senior management, and the suppliers were  
placed on restricted status with no new Microsoft 
business awarded until the issues were resolved. 
In all instances, the suppliers instituted corrective 
action plans that were approved by Microsoft  
and follow-up audits confirmed that the suppliers 
were implementing the corrective action plans.

In keeping with our corporate commitment to 
transparency, we provide year-over-year data on 
findings of critical/serious nonconformance  
with the requirements covered in these audits and 
assessments. Please note that changes in the  
number of audits and assessments conducted 
each year and the scope of those audits cause  
fluctuations in year-over-year comparisons. 

For instance, in FY14 we invested significant time 
and resources working with our third-party  
audit firms to enhance the rigor of their audits.  
As a result of the enhanced rigor of third-party 
audits, the total number of critical/serious  
non-conformance findings increased in FY14  
from the previous year.

*   Examples of these six nonconformances include requiring workers
      to stay in the factory dormitory after work or to have their lunches and 
     dinners only in the factory, as well as two cases where factories kept foreign 
     workers’ passports and did not allow workers to refuse overtime work. 

** These three cases involved nonconformances for overtime and other
     requirements that apply to student workers of legal working age. They did 
     not involve under-aged workers. However, under the EICC’s audit protocol, 
     nonconformances with protections for student workers are included in this 
     category. All three of these nonconformances have been corrected. 

*** The majority of these cases involved factories not paying sufficient    
 overtime compensation according to the local minimum wage. 

**** New issue category in FY14.

in Our Hardware Supply Chain

Enhancing Workplace  
Experiences

Beyond compliance audits and assessments,  
we work with our contracted suppliers to build 
their capabilities by sharing experiences and  
best practices, including detailed guidelines on 
how to improve factory workers’ living environ-
ments and environmental health and safety  
systems. An example of this is the implementation 
of our Tier 1 Model Factory Scorecard created  
in FY13 with input from worker surveys and  
suppliers to identify best practices in living and 
working conditions. 

The Model Factory Scorecard provides Tier 1  
suppliers and Microsoft factory managers with 
each supplier’s performance against SEA require-
ments and identifies best practices to help 
factories achieve higher standards in the following 
areas: compliance management system and  
performance; living conditions; worker training 
and development; environmental health and 
safety; and communication and transparency.  
In FY14, we began rating each of our Tier 1  

factories on the Model Factory Scorecard on a 
quarterly basis. Over the course of the year, we 
measured significant improvements in factory 
performance and management systems related  
to the compliance section of the scorecard.  
At the start of FY14, none of our eight Tier 1 suppli-
ers met our target performance goal of 95 percent 
or more on the scorecard; by the end of FY14,  
six of our Tier 1 suppliers achieved the target 
performance goal.

In FY14 we also significantly expanded job-related 
and life skills training opportunities in our Tier 1 
supplier factories. To bring our successful China 
YouthSpark Information Technology (IT) skills train-
ing program to factory workers, we created and 
launched both classroom-based and self-guided 
online IT skills courses designed for delivery at 
manufacturing facilities in China. In the second 
half of FY14 we piloted the training at one Tier 1 
factory and reached over 3,300 workers in the 
first six months of the program. That program will 
continue and we seek to roll out the training to 
other Tier 1 suppliers in FY15.  

Other training investments in FY14 included: 

•  Developing life skills video trainings on  
topics like financial management and 
interpersonal communication; 

•  Providing reproductive health education 

programs at all of our Tier 1 suppliers through  
the HERproject (Health Enables Returns) run  
by Business for Social Responsibility; 

•  Piloting line leader capability training to 

improve front-line supervisors’ communication 
skills and management effectiveness; and  

•  Creating parenting programs to support 

migrant parent workers who may be far away 
from their families.

6.2 Social and Environmental Accountability  

in Our Hardware Supply Chain

Environmental, Health, and 
Safety Capability Building

Factory worker health and safety is a top prior-
ity for Microsoft. Over the past four years we 
have significantly expanded our engagements to 
help suppliers create and maintain safe working 
environments. In FY14 we expanded the reach of 
these efforts across our hardware and packaging 
supply chain. These programs included: 

Training Resources: 
In FY14, we developed and made available  
to suppliers 40 environmental, health, and safety 
(EH&S) training course modules. We also  
conducted trainings for 20 high-risk suppliers,  
benefitting more than 20,000 workers. 

Management System Resources: 
We worked with factory management to empha-
size the need to use competent and experienced 
EH&S professionals to define and implement the 
programs necessary to build a culture of health 
and safety. To address this, we piloted a number 
of training modules in our Tier 1 and high-risk 
Tier 2 suppliers including “Safety Culture,” “EH&S 
Professionals and Senior Management Capability 
Improvement,” “EH&S Employee Participation,” 
“Risk Behavior Change,” “EH&S Standardization,” 
“Risk Assessment,” “Chemical Safety and Manage-
ment,” “Line Manager EH&S Skills Improvement,” 
“Safety Officer Certification for EH&S Staff,”  
“Prevention of Occupational Disease,” and  
“Effective Water Management.” 

Injury Data Tracking:  
In FY14, we began tracking key health and safety 
performance indicators for our Tier 1 factories 
using standard OSHA metrics. In FY14, our Tier 
1 suppliers averaged a work-related injuries and 
illness rate of 0.19 versus an industry benchmark  
of 1.4 and a lost working-hour accident rate  
also of 0.19 versus an industry benchmark of 0.7. 

Key Tier 2 Supplier Improvement Program:  
To address a special need for additional capacity 
building among some Tier 2 suppliers, we 
launched a new program to provide targeted 
component suppliers with onsite consulting 
from the SEA program team. We also continue 
our program to target our lowest performing 
component suppliers with special additional 
inspections that include Microsoft executives as 
well as SEA and Sourcing team members.  
This subset of suppliers face an additional 
compliance scorecard and must improve their 
performance within a quarter. As a result of 
the close engagement and collaboration with 
suppliers to make improvements identified  
during these audits and assessments, factory  
and worker conditions have advanced at many  
of our suppliers.

6.3 Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials 

Microsoft’s commitment to the responsible production of our hardware and packag-
ing extends to the raw materials that go into them. Like many in our industry,  
we have applied a particular focus to the issue of conflict minerals: tungsten, tin,  
tantalum, and gold that may be sourced from mines that fund armed groups  
operating in and around the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining coun-
tries. However, this year we formalized our values and approach around upstream 
responsible sourcing through “Microsoft’s Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials” 
policy that goes beyond conflict minerals to apply to all materials sourced around 
the world. This policy extends our Supplier Code of Conduct expectations in support 
of human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental protection, and business 
ethics to all harvested and extracted materials incorporated into our products. 

We exercise due diligence across our supply chain 
through a raw material tracing process that allows 
us to immediately identify the constituent sub-
stances used in our products and trace them back 
to their associated suppliers. Beyond our own  
supply chain due diligence, we are collaborating 
with a broad range of stakeholders to promote  
the development of standards for sustainable  
mining across the entire mining sector, from small 
artisanal mines to large operations. These efforts 
include working with the Initiative for Responsible 

Mining Assurance (IRMA), Pact, and the Alliance 
for Responsible Mining. It is our intention that 
these initiatives eventually will result in standards 
that enable our suppliers to purchase responsibly 
sourced materials for use in our products and 
address important challenges for the supply chains 
dependent upon the use of metals, ranging from 
under-aged labor to environmental degradation. 
On the specific issue of tin originating from  
Indonesia, Microsoft is also a member of the IDH 
Tin Working Group, which brings together a range 
of stakeholders seeking to address the social and 
environmental issues related to tin mining. 

In another example, we have collaborated with  
our suppliers and other hardware companies  
since 2007 to address conflict minerals from the 
eastern DRC. We prohibit our suppliers from  
using any minerals that they know are not  
DRC conflict free, and we expect our suppliers  
to engage in robust due diligence activities.  
We provide a detailed discussion of our conflict 
minerals due diligence process and findings in 
our June 2014 Conflict Minerals Report filed 
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
under requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Microsoft’s report has been cited for its leadership 
in transparency with the disclosure of as much 
smelter-level and country-of-origin data as we 
have available. As with our broader efforts on 
mining sustainability, we believe that collaborative 
partnerships are most effective in addressing 
conflict minerals.  

We have supported the Conflict Free 
Smelter Initiative (CFSI) since its inception 
in 2010 and funded an early adopters 
program to make it easier for smelters to 
become certified through CFSI’s Conflict 
Free Smelter Program. 

We support several other organizations promoting 
responsible mining and an end to conflict in  
and around the DRC, including the Public-Private 
Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade and  
the Responsible Sourcing Network’s Multi- 
Stakeholder Group.

In FY13, Microsoft created a new management function to consolidate and enhance 
responsible sourcing activities related to our non-hardware suppliers. In FY14,  
Microsoft began to screen our non-hardware suppliers on an ongoing basis against 
23 different ethical, social, and environmental risks by country and by commodity 
category. We also began to roll out new assurance requirements for suppliers  
found to pose the highest risks. These include EICC-based supplier self-assessment 
questionnaires, contractually binding Responsible Sourcing Requirements, quarterly 
scorecards, onsite assessments, and third-party audits. 

Beyond risk mitigation, we also work to advance 
citizenship projects with our suppliers that create 
shared value. We provide curriculum and support 
to help our suppliers host Supplier YouthSpark 
Community Technology Centers, which offer tech-
nology skills trainings to supplier employees and 
to local community members. To date, we have 
partnered with 16 suppliers to host these centers 
at 26 locations in 13 countries and have trained 
over 40,000 participants, including almost 12,000 
in FY14. In FY14 we also collaborated with the 
Rockefeller Foundation to research and promote 
best practices in “Impact Sourcing,” which involves 
seeking suppliers that intentionally employ people 
who have limited opportunity for sustainable 

employment—often in low-income areas. To date 
Microsoft has supported impact sourcing projects 
in the United States, Kenya, Uganda, and India  
and we are working to extend this approach with 
more suppliers in other geographies. 

In addition, Microsoft has a long-standing and 
strong commitment to source from historically 
disadvantaged groups. Our Procurement team  
is committed to increasing our spending with 
diverse suppliers as part of our Supplier Diversity 
Program. In FY14, Microsoft spent $2 billion  
with minority-, disabled-, veteran-, and woman- 
owned businesses, placing Microsoft in the  
top 20 companies globally for spending with 
diverse suppliers.

6.5 FY14 Highlights and FY15 Commitments

Progress Against FY14 Commitments

FY15 Commitments

Goal: Continuing to work to advance industry-wide  
efforts to achieve a conflict mineral-free electronics supply  
chain, to implement our own conflict minerals due 
diligences processes, and to meet the new public  
disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act that go 
into effect in May 2014.  

We focused on efforts both in our supply chain and across  
our industry to address conflict minerals and broader issues 
under our Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials policy.  
Our first Conflict Minerals Report filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission has been cited for leadership in 
transparency with the disclosure of as much smelter-level 
and country-of-origin data that we have available.

Goal: Enhancing working and living conditions in our Tier 
1 factories through efforts such as implementation of our 
Model Factory Program, which includes standardized living 
condition requirements, life skills classes, IT skills training, 
and enhanced worker grievance reporting programs.  

We fully implemented our Model Factory Program and 
scorecard with our Tier 1 factories and saw notable improve-
ments in their performance over the course of FY14.

Goal: Reducing EH&S risks by providing additional guide-
lines on common deficiencies identified in our audits. 

We significantly enhanced the EH&S resources and trainings 
that we provide to suppliers.

Goal: Improving overall capabilities of low-performing, 
high-risk Tier 2 factories by providing consulting and 
training on identified deficiencies.  

We launched a new program to provide targeted component 
suppliers with onsite consulting from the SEA program  
team to identify root causes of health and safety risks and 
determine the necessary training and capability programs 
needed to address these issues long term.

•  Evaluating and aligning our principles, policies, and 

activities across the Microsoft Devices Group to include 
the factories and suppliers related to the Nokia Devices 
and Services business we acquired near the end of FY14.  

•  Continuing to scale our SEA supply chain programs 

such as the Model Factory Program, Worker Grievance 
reporting, and EH&S capability building to continue to 
enhance worker living and working conditions.  

•  Continuing to invest in improving the management 
system capabilities of low-performing, high-risk  
Tier 2 factories by providing targeted SEA consulting  
and training. 

•  Working collaboratively with NGOs and others in our 

industry to advance the goals of the Microsoft Policy on 
Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials, including further 
progress addressing conflict minerals. 

•  Enhancing the screening of our non-hardware supply 
chain annually for ethical, social, and environmental  
risks and deepening assurance requirements for suppliers 
found to pose the highest risks. These will include 
EICC-based supplier self-assessment questionnaires, 
contractually binding Responsible Sourcing 
Requirements, quarterly scorecards, onsite assessments, 
and third-party audits.

About this Report

7.1 Our Approach

At Microsoft, environmental sustainability is both a responsibility and an opportunity 
to create business value in how we operate, how we serve our customers, and  
how we contribute to society. We work to reduce the environmental impact of our 
own operations and of the services and devices that we offer and also collaborate 
with customers, business partners, governments, NGOs, and others to apply  
the power of information technology to address pressing environmental problems.

Environmental Principles,  
Policies, and Management

Microsoft’s commitment to environmental sustain-
ability is articulated in our Environmental  
Principles and Climate Change Policy Statement 
and embedded in other corporate policies for  
how we run our business, such as our Environ-
mental Compliance Specifications for hardware 
and our policy on Responsible Sourcing of  
Raw Materials.

Microsoft has a global corporate environmental 
strategy team and environmental experts embed-
ded within engineering, manufacturing and supply 
chain, procurement, research, real estate and 
facilities, datacenters, and legal and corporate 
affairs. Their work is governed through executive 
oversight and is reviewed semi-annually by  
the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of  
our Board of Directors.

To reduce the environmental impact of our own 
operations, our corporate environmental strategy 
is to “Be Lean, Be Green, Be Accountable”: 

•  Be Lean by reducing operational energy use, 

water use, and waste. 

training in chemical management for hardware lab 
employees and design for environment training 
for packaging engineers. We also promote broad 
environmental awareness by emailing an annual 
update on our environmental goals and progress 
to all Microsoft employees globally. 

•  Be Green by increasing our purchase of 
renewable energy and carbon offsets. 

•  Be Accountable by quantifying the carbon 

impact of our operations and driving 
responsible business decisions around energy 
use and air travel by: 
–  Measuring our emissions. 
–  Setting an internal price on carbon. 
–  Charging a carbon fee to the teams  
    responsible for those emissions. 

Our environmental strategy includes a corporate 
carbon neutrality goal as well as goals for specific 
areas of our business, ranging from datacenter 
efficiency to energy and waste reduction at 
Microsoft campuses to the use of recycled content 
in packaging. Microsoft employees receive the 
appropriate role-based environmental training 
and certifications as needed for their jobs, such as 

Microsoft has had selected parts of our business 
such as our European Operations Center externally 
certified to the International Organization for  
Standardization (ISO) 14001 environmental  
management standard for a number of years.  
In FY14 we took a major step forward by gaining  
a cross-company ISO 14001 certification for  
Microsoft’s hardware and packaging manufac-
turing supply chain. Though we have had a 
longstanding commitment to supply chain sustain-
ability, including a Supplier Code of Conduct  
that requires Microsoft suppliers to demonstrate 
social and environmental responsibility, this level 
of certification represents a new commitment  
to minimizing the environmental footprint of our 
hardware and packaging.

7.2 Climate and Energy

Microsoft’s Climate Change Policy Statement recognizes that climate change is  
“a serious challenge that requires a comprehensive and global response from all  
sectors of society.” To do our part, Microsoft has worked hard to reduce the carbon 
footprint of our operations, committed to carbon neutrality, and engaged our  
customers and others around the globe to help tackle the challenge of climate 
change. In recognition of our climate efforts, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure 
Project) included Microsoft on its Global 500 Climate Performance Leadership  
Index in September 2013. We earned the top grade “A” in CDP’s assessment of our 
performance to promote climate change mitigation, adaptation, and transparency, 
and CDP rated our disclosure and transparency on climate issues at 96 out of 100. 

Carbon Neutrality  
Commitment and Carbon Fee

Microsoft is committed to being carbon neutral 
globally—meaning net-zero emissions from  
business air travel and the energy to power  
our datacenters, software development labs, and 
offices worldwide. To meet our commitment,  
we instituted an internal carbon fee model that 
drives accountability across Microsoft’s global 
business while raising funds to invest in internal 
efficiency projects, renewable energy, and  
carbon offset projects. 

Microsoft 2014 Citizenship Report

We met our carbon neutrality commitment in  
FY14 through internal efficiency projects, the  
purchase of more than 3 billion kilowatt hours 
(kWh) of renewable energy, and a carbon  
offset project portfolio representing 600,000 
metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. 
Besides addressing greenhouse gas emissions,  
the projects protect ecosystems and benefit  
nearly 3 million people with improved health, 
income, and employment opportunities.  
To share more detailed insights and lessons 
learned from implementing the carbon fee,  
we published a guide for organizations consider-
ing the model, which is available online:  
The Microsoft Carbon Fee: Theory and Practice. 

Driving Energy Efficiency 
Across Our Operations

Buildings:  
All new buildings that Microsoft owns are built to 
LEED standards, using approximately 20 percent 
less energy than traditional buildings and less 
water. In addition, we’ve created environmental 
showcase projects around the world from  
Hyderabad, India, to Shanghai, China. We also 
seek to reduce energy use in existing buildings. 
Over the past two years, Microsoft has cut 
energy use by up to 10 percent at our 125-building,  
500-acre Redmond campus with our Energy-
Smart Buildings initiative. The initiative uses an 
interconnected energy management system that 
analyzes 500 million data transactions per day 
from 30,000 pieces of equipment to flag problems 
and prioritize fixes. The system has quickly paid for 
itself, saving $2 million in energy costs its first year.

Datacenters: 
We’re designing energy-saving approaches into 
our new datacenters, such as using outside  
air cooling and airside economizers that dramati-
cally cut the energy and water used for cooling.  
These measures have helped us achieve a goal set 

by our datacenter team that all new datacenters 
have an average 1.125 Power Usage Effectiveness 
(PUE), which is one-third less than the indus-
try average datacenter PUE of 1.7. Our total fleet 
of datacenters (new and existing) has an average 
PUE of 1.4. We are working to further improve the 
efficiency of our existing datacenters with lower-
energy servers, compressor energy reduction,  
and custom light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. 
We are concerned about not just efficiency inside 
the datacenter, but also how to create dramatically 
more efficient systems, from the power plant  
to the chip. Examples of this approach include our 
pilot datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming, which  
will run completely independently of the grid using 
energy generated from biogas, a byproduct  
of a nearby water treatment plant. We’ve also 
pioneered a new concept to integrate fuel cells 
directly into server racks, stripping out most  
of the infrastructure found in the traditional data-
center energy supply chain, which we expect  
to effectively cut the energy use in half by elimi-
nating transmission losses and other inefficiencies. 
Beyond the datacenters themselves, we’re  
building energy-saving features into our cloud  
services, such as the ability for developers to  
automatically scale their resource use to demand.

Using Renewable Energy

In order of preference, we seek to use renewable energy by:

1

2

3

Connecting facilities directly 
to renewable energy sources 
where feasible.

Signing long-term renewable 
power purchase agreements 
in regions where we  
have operations and those 
projects are viable.

Investing in renewable 
energy certificates (RECs) to 
match our total electricity 
usage with the equivalent 
number of RECs that are 
credible, are verifiable, and 
add additional renewable 
energy to the grid.

Microsoft 2014 Citizenship Report

During FY14, we purchased more than 3 billion 
kWh of green power, equal to 100 percent of  
our global electricity use. We also signed a  
20-year agreement to purchase 100 percent of  
the output of the 110-megawatt (MW) Keechi  
Wind project, a new wind farm that will begin 
operating in 2015. We generate a small amount  
of onsite renewable energy, such as from solar 
panels covering the rooftops on our Silicon Valley  
campus. Finally, access to renewable energy is 
among the criteria that we consider in siting  
datacenters. A number of our datacenters, like  
our complex in Quincy, Washington, are powered 
by hydroelectricity.

Driving Energy Efficiency in 
Our Services and Devices

We are focused on and committed to increasing 
computing power per unit of energy consumed 
across the services and devices that we offer  
in the marketplace. Each new version of Windows 
offers enhancements to energy efficiency and 
power management tools. Through products like 
Microsoft System Center we provide IT administra-
tors with controls to implement group policies  

that apply energy-saving power management  
settings across all the computers on their network. 
The move to cloud computing is also enabling 
more efficient computing, which we’re boosting  
by building new energy-saving features into  
our cloud services. Our Azure online service 
includes tools to allow developers to easily auto-
scale their applications, which reduces energy  
use and their costs.  

We’re also driving energy efficiency in our devices. 
The latest version of the Xbox 360, for instance, 
uses less than half the energy for game play and 
navigation mode than the first Xbox released 
in 2005. Despite its increased next-generation 
computing power and functionality, the Xbox One 
launch version uses less power than the launch 
version of the Xbox 360 did (although more than 
the latest Xbox 360 version). We ship all Xbox 
consoles with auto-power down features turned 
on by default so that when the consoles are  
not being used they automatically turn off.  
Similarly, the Microsoft Surface tablet launched 
with dramatically lower power consumption  
than current laptop computers and we’ve held 
energy use steady as we’ve introduced newer, 
more powerful versions.

Public Policy Engagement  
on Climate and Energy

We have also supported industry and  
multi-stakeholder initiatives to address climate 
policy. Among these: 

Microsoft is working to advance public policies 
that promote the use of information and commu-
nication technology (ICT) to advance energy  
efficiency, spur innovation and economic oppor-
tunity, and contribute to practical strategies for 
mitigating climate change. For the past five years, 
our annual Global Public Policy Agenda has 
included a section supporting government policies 
that support technological advances and  
innovation to reduce energy use and limit the 
effects of climate change. For the 2014-2015 
Global Public Policy Agenda, we strengthened 
the energy and environment section by expressing  
a preference for “cost-effective policies that 
increase the availability of low carbon and renew-
able energy for us to use in our operations.”  

•  We are a signatory to the Climate Declaration, 
a nonpartisan statement from the business 
community developed by Ceres and its Business 
for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy (BICEP) 
coalition, which notes that “tackling climate 
change is one of America’s greatest economic 
opportunities of the 21st century.”  

•  We are a founding member of the Digital 

Energy & Sustainability Solutions Campaign 
(DESSC), a coalition of leading ICT companies 
and environmental NGOs. DESSC is committed 
to advancing public policies that help drive 
sustainable economic growth through ICT-
enabled energy efficiency and clean  
energy innovation. 

•  We serve on the board of the Global 
e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI),  
a collaborative effort between leading 
IT companies and the United Nations 
Environment Programme and International 
Telecommunication Union. GeSI created  
the influential Smart 2020 report on ways  
that IT can address climate change and  
led the development of the US Addendum  
to the Smart 2020 report and an update,  
the Smarter 2020 report.

Carbon Footprint  
and Energy Use

We strongly believe in the importance of mea-
suring and transparently disclosing our carbon 
footprint. We have voluntarily reported our carbon 
footprint through CDP since 2004, and our past 
carbon emissions are available at www.cdproject.
net. We also require our contracted hardware  
suppliers to report their emissions to CDP.  
For other categories of suppliers, we promoted 
carbon footprint reporting with a pilot project  
in FY14 to provide training on CDP reporting and 
to fund a select set of suppliers’ registration fees 
for CDP reporting. The following graphs and charts 
detail the highlights of our most recent filing 
with CDP and trends in our greenhouse gas emis-
sions and energy use.1  

1   Note that because the CDP reporting deadline closes in May  
before the end of our fiscal year, the most recent CDP carbon 
footprint data we have available and verified is for FY13, not FY14. 
FY13 is also the first year we have data available on a fiscal  
year basis. We previously reported by calendar year. Our green-
house gas and energy data provided in our CDP filings and  
this report represent 100 percent of Microsoft’s global operations  
and revenue.

7.3 Operational Impacts

Water 

FY13 Water Use by Source 2

Waste

Microsoft’s operations are generally not water 
intensive, with the exception of some of  
our datacenters that rely on water for cooling.  
We’ve worked to mitigate the impacts of datacen-
ter water use by using recycled municipal  
waste water in some water-scarce locations  
such as San Antonio, Texas.

Rainwater
(30,168)

Groundwater
(8,078)

Recycled Water Supplies
(449,993)

Of even more significance, our latest 
air-cooled datacenters use only 1 to 
3 percent of the water required for a 
traditional datacenter and they produce 
no wastewater. 

Beyond datacenters, Microsoft continues to invest 
in water-saving fixtures in our office buildings  
and smart landscape irrigation practices to  
conserve water.

2   This data covers 55 percent of Microsoft’s facilities by square foot-
age. As with greenhouse gas emissions, we publicly report water 
through the CDP Water Project and the most recent data available 
reflects the previous fiscal year. Additional information and our 
previous years’ water data are available publicly through CDP.

Microsoft’s Real Estate and Facilities teams around 
the world implement waste minimization programs, 
including office supply reuse, recycling and, in  
many cases, composting programs. Among our  
accomplishments, we reduced, reused, or recycled 
99 percent of the waste from our Redmond,  
Washington dining facilities by switching to com-
postable tableware, administering aggressive  
recycling programs, and adapting our menu to get 
the most from each item of food served. 

We’ve also set a long-term goal of 90 percent  
waste diversion from landfills across our global 
headquarter facilities in Puget Sound, Washington, 
which represent approximately 36 percent  
of our total real estate portfolio. We’re rapidly 
approaching that goal and are working to  
extend that goal to additional campuses in the 
United States and around the globe.

7.3 Operational Impacts

As we expand our on-campus hardware device 
labs, we have begun to generate hazardous waste 
and e-waste from developing and testing proto-
type devices. We have implemented a chemical 
management program that helps employees 
prevent waste generation by using less-polluting 
products and reduce or eliminate unused  
materials. When we do generate waste, we recycle 
whenever possible and dispose of any remainder 
as required by local regulations. We have also 
developed an auditing program to verify that any 
facility that handles our waste for recycling or 
disposal can do so responsibly and while comply-
ing with environmental regulations. In FY14 we 
generated 1.68 metric tons of hazardous waste  
across our Puget Sound facilities, which was 
disposed of at properly permitted US hazardous 
waste facilities. 

7.4 Reducing Impacts Across  

the Life Cycle of Our Devices 

Design for Green

The Safety, Compliance, and Sustainability team 
within the Microsoft Devices Group incorporates 
environmental and safety principles and processes 
in the design and production of our devices 
and product packaging.3 The team works with 
design groups through a Design for Green initia-
tive to evaluate and encourage the use of more 
environmentally benign materials, increase the 
recyclability of our devices and packaging, and 
minimize material use. The team provides a Design 
for Green scorecard of products in development 
to suggest alternative materials and other ways to 
address environmental impacts. We also require 
our suppliers to identify every material that’s in 
our products and to follow a comprehensive list 
of restricted substances specifications to avoid 
hazardous materials.  

3  In April 2014, Microsoft acquired the Nokia Devices and  

Services business, which became Microsoft Mobile Oy (MMO),  
and expanded our product line to include mobile phones.  
For this reporting year, information about MMO’s environmental  
sustainability efforts including life-cycle analysis of MMO  
products are detailed in the Nokia People and Planet Report 2013.  
Our Microsoft 2015 Citizenship Report will provide data on  
environmental sustainability related to Microsoft’s expanded 
range of hardware devices.

To address sustainability in packaging, we’ve 
designed packaging for Xbox One, Surface, and 
our hardware peripherals to reduce the use of 
materials and replace plastics with paperboard 
packaging and materials from sugarcane waste. 
We also set standards of a minimum of 50 percent 
recycled content (25 percent of which must be 
post-consumer) for paperboard packaging and a 
minimum of 25 percent post-consumer content  
for rigid plastic packaging. 

Device Take-Back  
and Recycling

Microsoft is committed to meeting and going 
beyond government standards on take-back  
and responsible recycling or disposal of electron-
ics, batteries, and packaging. We are a member  
of more than 66 government-mandated  
recycling schemes and producer responsibility 
organizations worldwide. In addition, we also  
offer several voluntary take-back and recycling 
programs, including incentives to bring used  
electronics to Microsoft Stores for recycling.  
We offer a comprehensive online tool to help  
consumers understand the recycling options

7.5 Applying Technology to  

Environmental Challenges

Microsoft works to responsibly reuse, refurbish,  
or recycle used computers and electronics from  
our own operations and used personal and  
electronic items from our employees. For our own 
e-waste and the e-waste we collect from employ-
ees and customers, Microsoft requires external 
certification of the recycling partners that we 
contract with and bans any landfilling or exporta-
tion of used electronics that they collect. 

available to them in their specific location.  
Where no local options exist, consumers can use 
the tool to contact Microsoft and we will gener-
ate a postage-paid e-label for them to use to send 
their equipment to a contracted recycler for free.

Microsoft also offers two programs, Microsoft 
Authorized Refurbisher (MAR) and Microsoft 
Registered Refurbisher Program (RRP), that  
help refurbishers extend the life of used PCs by  
providing them with commercial licenses for 
Microsoft software and non-profit organization 
licenses for those serving non-profits and  
schools. Through these programs, Microsoft and 
our refurbisher partners provided nonprofits  
and schools access to 799,930 refurbished com-
puters in FY14.

As we describe in detail at www.microsoft.com/environment, we are collaborating 
with technology partners, government agencies, non-profit organizations, public 
policy advocacy organizations, and the scientific community to better understand, 
measure, and build solutions to address energy and environmental challenges. 

As part of our commitment to sustainability, we 
seek to turn solutions to environmental challenges 
into business opportunities. A good example 
of this is Microsoft’s CityNext initiative, which 
launched early in FY14. 

Through CityNext, Microsoft and our 
worldwide partner network seek  
to provide cities with services and 
devices to be more sustainable and 
economically competitive. 

Cities that take advantage of Microsoft 
technologies and partner solutions are improving 
operations and reducing consumption by  
using software to collect and analyze both 
real-time and historical data from a wide range  
of sources, including renewable energy systems.  
The information can be used to cut power  
costs, improve forecasting, and detect impending 
equipment failures.  

We’ve also worked to encourage and support  
the many Microsoft partners also delivering  
commercial solutions that increase ICT resource 
efficiency and developing a range of solutions 
on the Microsoft platform that address energy, 
carbon, water, and other resource challenges.

In addition, Microsoft supports environmental 
research that isn’t tied to developing a specific 
product or service but rather advances the field  
of computing and demonstrates how cloud 
services and mobile devices can combine to help 
solve some of society’s biggest environmental 
challenges. Microsoft Research’s Earth, Energy,  
and Environment collaboration projects focus on 
the development and adoption of technologies 
for scientific visualization and data management—
especially technologies that accelerate insight  
into the environmental and earth sciences.

FY14 Highlights and FY15 Commitments

Progress Against FY14 Commitments

FY15 Commitments

•  Maintaining our commitment to achieving carbon 

neutrality and net-zero emissions for our datacenters, 
software development labs, offices, and employee  
air travel by increasing energy efficiency and investing  
in renewable energy and carbon offset projects.  

•  Establishing targets with business groups to improve 

operational energy efficiency. 

•  Building on the model of our 110-MW Keechi Wind 

power purchase agreement with additional large-scale 
commitments to purchase renewable energy. 

•  Meeting our 100 percent renewable energy commitment 
by matching the total amount of kwh consumed with the 
equivalent volume of renewable energy purchased. 

•  Expanding our global data collection and reporting  

of waste and water data.

Goal: Achieving carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions 
for our datacenters, software development labs,  
offices, and employee air travel by increasing energy 
efficiency and investing in renewable energy and  
carbon offset projects.  

We met our carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions goals  
in FY14 and expanded our carbon fee program for FY15.

Goal: Evolving our internal carbon fee—based on current 
market pricing for renewable energy and carbon offsets—
and making the company’s business divisions financially 
responsible for the cost of their carbon emissions.  

Our Chief Financial Officer reviewed and expanded our 
carbon fee model to include funding internal carbon  
reduction grants.

Goal: Sourcing more renewable power and continuing to 
implement more sustainability in our datacenter designs. 

During FY14, we purchased more than 3 billion kWh of green 
power, equal to 100 percent of our global electricity use.  
We also signed a 20-year agreement to purchase  
100 percent of the output of the 110-MW Keechi Wind 
project, a new wind farm that will begin operating in 2015.

Goal: Extending an energy-management program  
to targeted US-based Microsoft facilities to decrease 
energy use.  

We are using learnings from our Energy-Smart Buildings 
initiative to target energy-saving opportunities at other 
Microsoft facilities in the United States and around the globe.
