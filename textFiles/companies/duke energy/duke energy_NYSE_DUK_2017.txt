About This Report

I am pleased to share Duke Energy’s 12th Sustainability Report. This year’s report reflects a theme we’ve been 
observing over the past dozen years: The energy industry is in transition and the successful companies are those 
that continue to recognize and adapt to the changing expectations of the customers and communities they serve.

For Duke Energy, the facts and figures included in this report are one measure for the progress we are making.  
Our numbers show a company shifting from coal to natural gas and greater reliance on renewable energy, reducing 
our environmental footprint and modernizing our energy grid to support new customer-focused technology.

Progress on our company’s goals reflects that sustainability is a priority at Duke Energy. We continue to evolve 
our business approach to actively engage stakeholders, embrace innovation, exceed customer expectations and 
positively impact the communities we power.

In the report, you will notice the many areas where engagement with our external stakeholders has created positive 
outcomes on the legislative, regulatory and community fronts. Whether it was a new law, new tool or a new 
program to better serve customers, maintaining open, two-way communication channels has helped promote a 
better environment for sustainability to thrive at Duke Energy.

As always, we aim to make sure our information is comprehensive, clear and paints an accurate picture of the 
company. We are proud of the progress we’ve made and are focused on our opportunities for improvement.

In addition to this Sustainability Report, you can find a detailed Global Reporting Initiative Index on our website. 
Duke Energy is also participating in the Edison Electric Institute’s sustainability reporting pilot. Lastly, the company 
issued a Climate Report earlier this year to provide more details on how we are mitigating risk from climate change. 

Thank you for interest in our 2017 Sustainability Report and Duke Energy.

A Message From Our CEO

Energy remains the lifeblood of the economy, but our industry is undergoing a major 
transformation. To continue successfully powering lives and communities, we need to 
embrace change as never before.

This environment provides an opportunity to innovate – and sustainability remains 
central to our plan to create a smarter energy future for customers. 

2017 proved Duke Energy is doing just that. We unveiled our 10-year vision for our 
company, and we executed it while delivering safe, affordable, cleaner energy and 
preparing for what’s next. 

Our Results in 2017

As this report shows, we delivered strong results. Here are a few highlights:

    We have reduced our generation fleet’s carbon dioxide emissions by 31 percent 
from our 2005 levels and recycled 80 percent of our solid waste last year – one 
year ahead of target.

    Our energy efficiency programs helped customers reduce energy consumption 

and peak demand by more than 14,400 gigawatt-hours and 5,300 megawatts, 
respectively.

    As of year-end 2017, Duke Energy owned or had under contract over  

6,400 megawatts of wind, solar and biomass energy.

    We maintained our industry-leading safety performance, reduced reportable 

environmental events for the third straight year and nearly broke the company 
record for our nuclear fleet’s capacity factor.

    We increased our quarterly dividend by 4 percent and now have paid one for  

92 consecutive years.

In 2017, we unveiled 
our 10-year vision 
for our company 
and we executed it 
while delivering safe, 
affordable, cleaner 
energy and preparing 
for what’s next .

Our Stakeholders and What Matters Most 

Our Stakeholders

What Matters Most

Our stakeholders often have divergent views on how 
Duke Energy should meet future customer demand 
for reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy. 
Their views surface locally, nationally and globally 
in response to a number of factors including new 
projects we develop, our long-range planning, changing 
legislative and regulatory policy, or in response to our 
enhanced products and services.

Our stakeholders expect us to engage with them on 
important issues. As an industry leader, Duke Energy 
has a rich history of working with a diverse group  
of stakeholders. Our past experience demonstrates  
that we get better outcomes through collaboration  
and engagement.

During 2017, we continued to improve our stakeholder 
engagement capabilities and governance. We are 
focusing on common processes and tools, best 
practice sharing and improved alignment across our 
jurisdictions. Our External Relations Council, comprised 
of company leaders, continues to provide oversight and 
coordination of stakeholder interactions at the national, 
state and local levels. 

We will soon have Advisory Councils active in all of our 
states. These councils provide an opportunity for Duke 
Energy state presidents to meet three to four times a 
year with representatives of diverse stakeholder groups 
and engage in two-way dialogue. These councils 
enable stakeholders to learn about our business and, 
more importantly, to provide their insight and advice to 
inform company plans.

Successfully working with stakeholders will continue 
to be key as we implement our vision of providing the 
energy solutions that customers value.

Duke Energy’s approach to sustainability focuses on 
the issues that are most important to our stakeholders 
and to us. We identify issues from a variety of sources 
such as stakeholder feedback, surveys, thought leader 
perspectives, social and traditional media coverage, 
and shareholder proposals in our sector.

Another important input is research conducted by 
the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). EPRI’s 
latest research, entitled “Priority Sustainability Issues 
for the North American Electric Power Industry,” was 
published in October 2017. It was based on extensive 
stakeholder interviews and helped validate our list of 
priority issues.

We have also mapped our priority issues to the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which 
aim to “end poverty, protect the planet and ensure 
prosperity for all.” Since their development in 2015, 
the 17 SDGs have gained traction with stakeholders 
concerned about sustainability issues. While there was 
alignment between our priorities and several of the 
SDGs, goals “Seven: Affordable and Clean Energy,” and 
“Thirteen: Climate Action,” are especially applicable to 
our company.  

The graphic depicts the relationship among Duke 
Energy, its stakeholders (shown in green) and the most 
important issues (shown in blue) as overlapping circles 
within circles to show that they are interconnected. The 
stakeholders and issues are both arranged alphabetically 
to make it clear that they are all important while safety, 
as always, is number one.

Duke Energy continues to offer a variety of energy efficiency programs – 
helping customers take more control of their energy use.

Saving Money with Free 
Energy Efficiency Advice 

Duke Energy continues to expand its 
portfolio of energy efficiency programs 
that benefit our customers and  
the environment. 

Duke Energy’s Referral Network 
completed its first full year of operation 
in 2017, providing customers with 
energy-related advice and purchasing 
confidence when selecting home 
improvement contractors.

The program provides professionals for 
home improvement services such as 
attic insulation and HVAC and water 
heating repair and replacement. 

In 2017, the program generated more 
than 10,000 referrals in the Carolinas 
and Kentucky. The program will expand 
to Indiana and Ohio in 2018. Referred 
contractors can also assist customers in 
qualifying for up to $1,600 in rebates 
via the Smart $aver® program.

Since 2009, the company has 
delivered more than 80 million energy-
efficient lighting products to residential 
customers at deeply discounted prices. 
Newly expanded options for lamps 
and fixtures provide even more energy-

efficient solutions for every socket of 
our customers’ homes.

LEDs use 90 percent less energy and 
last 15 times longer than traditional 
bulbs, leading to savings on customers’ 
bills. Eligible customers can receive 
lighting options at participating 
retailers, accessing company-offered 
programs and by visiting the online store.

Duke Energy’s My Home Energy Report 
is approaching the 2 terawatt-hours 
of electricity saved. That’s enough to 
power 200,000 homes for a year. The 
program provides residential customers 
with a meaningful look at their energy 
use compared to similar homes based 
on age, size, location and heating 
source. It provides targeted insights to 
help customers take action to reduce 
their energy consumption. 

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the 
company started sending the reports 
to customers electronically if they have 
registered an email address. Through 
the program, nearly 23 million reports 
were sent in 2017. These reports are 
printed on 100 percent recycled  
paper and a reforestation project has 
planted nearly 20,000 trees as part  
of the program.

Massive Hurricane Irma

support staff who came to Florida from 25 states  
and Canada.

Hurricane Irma made history in September 2017 
as one of the strongest hurricanes on record in the 
Atlantic Basin, and the most destructive storm to ever 
hit Duke Energy’s Florida service area.

The peak number of power outages occurred Sept. 11  
when more than 1.3 million of Duke Energy’s 1.8 million  
Florida customers – almost 75 percent – lost power.

Damage to Duke Energy’s electrical distribution  
system was extensive and widespread. In some 
areas, the company had to rebuild the entire power 
distribution system.

The company replaced nearly 2,000 damaged power 
poles and more than 1,100 transformers – and 
inspected, repaired or replaced more than 1,000 miles 
of damaged power lines.

In addition, 124 high-voltage transmission lines and 
71 substations needed major repairs. 

The storm required a massive response. Duke Energy 
mobilized a small army of more than 12,000 line 
workers, tree professionals, damage assessors and 

The company restored power to more than 75 percent 
of its customers in three days – and 99 percent in 
eight days.

Duke Energy also learned valuable lessons to apply to 
future large storms.

For example, the company is improving its modeling 
to better integrate damage assessments from field 
workers in order to give customers more accurate 
estimated power restoration times.

The company also is strengthening its power outage 
management system that provides outage information 
to customers via phone, text and online maps.  

Meanwhile, Duke Energy will invest $3.4 billion over 
the next 10 years to further strengthen its Florida 
energy grid. One example: the company will move 
about 1,250 miles of its most outage-prone overhead 
power lines underground.

The company also is investing in wireless sensing 
devices and other technologies to create an intelligent 
electricity delivery system – a “smart grid” that reduces 
the number and length of power outages.

Electric Grid Modernization 
Continues on Several Fronts

$26 billion in economic output over  
10 years.

In 2017, Duke Energy continued to 
move forward with its $25 billion, 
10-year modernization plan to bolster 
the company’s multistate electric grid – 
the power lines, substations and other 
equipment that deliver electricity from 
power plants to customers.

The initiative will increase reliability, 
reduce power outages, strengthen the 
grid against physical and cyber threats, 
give customers more information and 
more control over their electricity use, 
and accommodate additional solar 
energy and energy storage.

In North Carolina and South Carolina, 
the modernization initiative is called 
Power/Forward Carolinas – a $16 billion  
plan to significantly upgrade the 
electric grid while also providing a 
strong economic stimulus that includes 
creation of 17,000 jobs and more than 

In Florida, Duke Energy completed work 
on an automated, self-optimizing grid 
network that enables the grid to self-
identify problems and reroute power 
to shorten or eliminate power outages. 
This advanced grid also will support the 
growth of solar power, energy storage 
and other emerging technologies.

Duke Energy plans to deploy 100 
similar self-healing networks in some  
of the company’s other service areas  
in 2018, with the goal of having  
80 percent of customers serviced by 
such networks in the next decade. 

Additionally, the company plans to 
use data analytics to identify the most 
outage-prone power lines and relocate 
them underground. This initiative will 
reduce the number of power outages and  
shorten restoration times after storms.

Meanwhile, Duke Energy continues to install digital 
smart meters that give customers more convenience 
and more control over their energy usage. The 
company installed 1.2 million meters in 2017 and  
will install an additional 1.4 million in 2018.

Today, 40 percent of Duke Energy’s customers are 
equipped with smart meters. The company remains  
on track to bring the technology to all of its customers 
by 2021.

The meters help customers save money by giving them 
online access to information about their electricity 
consumption, so they can adjust usage as they see fit.

The meters also enable Duke Energy to immediately 
determine when a customer loses power, so the 
company can quickly dispatch a repair crew.

Customer Satisfaction Scores Show 
Steady Improvement

While Duke Energy’s customer satisfaction scores 
improved for both business and residential segments 
in 2017, the company’s rankings still require 
improvement to be among the nation’s leaders.

All Duke Energy utilities are implementing plans to 
achieve top-quartile performance among large utilities 
in the J.D. Power Electric Utility Residential Study by 
the end of 2018.

In 2017, satisfaction scores for business customers 
increased for all four Duke Energy companies in the 
J.D. Power Electric Utility Business Study.

   Duke Energy Progress was up 16 points to 780, 

remaining in the first quartile.

   Duke Energy Florida was up 37 points to 771, 

moving up to the second quartile.

   Duke Energy Carolinas was up 19 points to 769, 

moving up to the second quartile.

The study rates companies on six factors: power 
quality and reliability, billing and payment,  
corporate citizenship, price, communications  
and customer service.

According to internal data and surveys, 88 percent  
of large business customers were “highly satisfied” 
with Duke Energy as their utility – down slightly from 
91 percent last year.

Among residential customers, 83 percent were highly 
satisfied with the service they received from Duke 
Energy in 2017 – up from 79 percent last year.

In the residential study, J.D. Power reported Duke 
Energy’s satisfaction scores were up for all four 
operating companies in 2017.

   Duke Energy Progress was up 42 points to 722, 

remaining in the second quartile nationally among 
all large utilities.

   Duke Energy Midwest was up 42 points to 721, 

remaining in the second quartile nationally among 
all large utilities.

   Duke Energy Carolinas was up 52 points to 721, 

moving up from the third to second quartile 
nationally among all large utilities.

   Duke Energy Florida was up 47 points to 701; 
however, the company remained in the fourth

Customer’s Question Led to 
an Innovative Solution

Jim Bradley has lived in Charlotte for 
30 years, and he never experienced as 
many power outages as he did in early 
2016. Frustrated, he contacted a friend 
who worked at Duke Energy. 

His question made it to Sasha Weintraub,  
senior vice president of customer 
solutions, and inspired a new system 
that would help reduce outages for  
all customers.

Weintraub routed the question to  
Norv Clontz, who was then director of 
grid analytics, and Clontz brought in 
Quinn Davis, who was then a manager 
in the power quality and reliability 
engineering department. With a few 
months of research and collaboration, 
the pair found the reason for Bradley’s 
outage – overgrown vegetation – and 
created the System Health Tool to help 
others, too. 

“It’s my job to prevent outages,” Davis 
said. “It’s all about asking, ‘What’s  
the best use of our next dollar to help 
the customer?’”

The new system identifies small pockets 
of poor performance and determines 
where grid investments are most 

needed. Before the System Health Tool, 
engineers had to look at performance 
indicators separately – vegetation 
management, infrastructure, reliability 
and customer satisfaction data – which 
didn’t present a clear picture of what 
areas needed improvements based 
on customer experience. The tool 
combines all of this data and shows 
sections of a map as red, orange and 
yellow based on priority.

Clontz and Davis won a James B. Duke  
Award, the company’s highest honor, 
for their innovative solution to a 
customer’s concern. The software has 
been particularly useful in research for 
our Power/Forward grid modernization 
initiative. This will include a $5 billion 
investment to reduce outages by 
burying lines and installing protective 
equipment in North Carolina’s most 
susceptible areas.

Grid & Clean Energy 
Investment Spurred  
By Settlement

In 2017, the Public Service 
Commission of Florida approved  
a settlement agreement that extends 
Duke Energy’s current multiyear  
rate plan to 2021.

The agreement, supported by a number of consumer 
groups, included $6 billion in renewable power and 
energy grid investments. It also would eliminate any 
further customer charges with the nuclear project in 
Levy County.

Some highlights:

   Duke Energy announced a four-year plan to add 
700 megawatts (MW) of solar energy, greatly 
accelerating the company’s previous 10-year solar 
installation plan. A future 75-MW plant in Hamilton 
County in north Florida will be one of the first of the 
new facilities.

   It expands customer choices with two new optional 
billing programs. One is a shared solar program to 
allow customers to participate in solar generation 
without having the solar facility on their property. 
The other is a fixed bill program for residential 
customers – allowing them to pay a fixed amount 
each month regardless of usage.

   It allows Duke Energy to invest to modernize the 
energy grid to enhance reliability, reduce outages 
and shorten restoration times.

   The company can install advanced metering 
technology (smart meters) to enable more 
bill-lowering tools, access to more information 
about energy use, and the ability to receive usage 
alerts, outage notifications and customized billing 
options once fully implemented.

   The settlement will allow the company to install 
more than 500 electric vehicle charging stations  
and up to 50 MW of battery energy storage.

“We applaud Duke Energy Florida for working 
proactively with stakeholders to embrace smart 
technologies that are both good for consumers and the 
environment,” said Dr. Stephen A. Smith, executive 
director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, in 
the press release announcing the settlement. “Large 
scale solar, electric vehicles and battery storage 
demonstrate that Duke is embracing technologies for 
the 21st century. We welcome Duke’s willingness to 
work with stakeholders on data collection and any rate 
design changes impacting customer-owned demand 
side solar.”

Solar Shines Bright in 2017

For the past few years, wind energy has been  
Duke Energy’s fastest growing renewable energy 
resource. But in 2017, solar power led the company’s 
transition to more renewable energy.

North Carolina continues to be the company’s top solar 
energy state. The company connected almost 500 
megawatts of solar power to its energy grid in 2017 – 
keeping North Carolina the No. 2 overall state in the 
nation for installed solar energy capacity.

In addition, the company worked with numerous 
stakeholders to support the Competitive Energy 
Solutions for North Carolina law, which will expand 
solar power even further in the state. The law – called 
H.B. 589 – helps Duke Energy roll out new programs 
that will make solar more attractive to all types 
of customers. In addition, the law will spur future 
construction of utility-scale solar projects that will 
serve thousands of customers.

With a number of solar facilities already in place,  
Duke Energy Florida announced it would add up to 
700 megawatts of solar over the next four years. Part 
of that growth is already underway. The 75-megawatt 
Hamilton Solar Plant is under construction now, and 
will produce enough emissions-free energy to power 
more than 20,000 homes at peak production.

In Northern Kentucky, Duke Energy completed three 
solar facilities in Kenton and Grant counties – the first 
company-owned and operated plants in the state.

In Indiana, Duke Energy, the Department of the Navy 
and Naval Support Activity (NSA) Crane celebrated the 
operation of a 17-megawatt solar power plant at NSA 
Crane – also the company’s first company-owned solar 
facility in the state.

In South Carolina, the company’s successful solar 
rebate program continued, with about 2,600 
customers signing up to take advantage of the 
company’s program.

The company’s commercial unit, Duke Energy 
Renewables, helped the company expand to a 
new state in 2017. The company acquired the 
25-megawatt Shoreham Solar Commons project  
in New York.

Still, there was progress made on wind energy 
in 2017. In Kay County, Okla., the company’s 
200-megawatt Frontier Windpower Project began 
producing power. It’s Duke Energy’s first renewable 
energy project in Oklahoma. The company sells the 
output to City Utilities of Springfield, Mo.

The company continues to be on track for its 
sustainability goal of owning or purchasing 8,000 
megawatts of wind, solar and biomass capacity by 
2020. At the end of 2017, the company’s overall  
total was 6,400 megawatts.

Battery Energy  
Storage Advances

A few years ago, battery energy  
storage was more demonstration  
than application.

But much of that changed in 2017 as 
Duke Energy began moving forward 
with energy storage projects that will 
help selected parts of the company’s 
territory. With renewable energy 
growing across the company, improved 
battery storage is needed to work in 
conjunction with wind, solar and the 
energy grid to provide reliable service  
to customers. 

In Indiana, Duke Energy is planning to 
install a 5-megawatt battery storage 
system and 3 megawatts of solar that 
will provide grid services, along with 
operating as a microgrid, at the Indiana 
National Guard’s Camp Atterbury 
training operation. The microgrid – 
connected energy sources that can 
serve a customer on its own – will help 
with reliability and grid security at  
the camp.

Duke Energy has also included  
75 megawatts of energy storage in  
its 2017 Integrated Resource Plan  
in the Carolinas.

In Asheville, N.C., a 9-megawatt 
lithium-ion battery system will be 
placed at a Duke Energy substation 
in a local community. The battery will 
primarily be used to help the electric 
system operate more efficiently. It will 
provide energy support to the electric 
system, including frequency regulation 
and other grid support services. 

In Hot Springs, N.C., a 4-megawatt 
lithium-ion battery system will help 
improve electric reliability for the town, 
along with providing services to the 
overall electric system.

Duke Energy has a smaller battery 
installation in Haywood County, N.C. 
The company has a 95-kilowatt-
hour zinc-air battery and 10-kilowatt 
solar installation serving a remote 
communications tower on Mount 
Sterling in the Smoky Mountains 
National Park. During the aftermath 
of Hurricane Irma, the installation’s 
microgrid operated without an outage 
to the facility.

As for the future, a settlement in Florida 
will allow the company to invest in 
up to 50 megawatts of battery energy 
storage in the state over the next 
five years. Duke Energy is currently 
evaluating sites for these deployments.

In 2017, Duke Energy 
moved forward with 
a number of battery 
storage projects that 
will be a part of the 
company’s regulated 
operations .

Duke Energy’s economic development team – through 
100 successful projects in 2017 – helped bring over 
12,000 new jobs and $5.9 billion in private-sector 
investment to the six states served by the company’s  
electric utilities.

Site Selection magazine named Duke Energy to its 
“Top Utilities in Economic Development” list for the 
13th consecutive year, citing the company’s numerous 
successful collaborations with state and local economic 
development agencies and business organizations.

The magazine also recognized Duke Energy’s efforts 
to build smarter energy infrastructure that bolsters 
recruitment of new businesses and reinforces retention 
of existing ones.

Duke Energy’s economic development specialists work 
year-round to help new companies worldwide open 
offices, manufacturing plants and other facilities in 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio 
and Kentucky.

The team also works hard to encourage existing 
companies in those states to expand at home, rather 
than look elsewhere.

In addition, the team in 2017 helped prepare 25 
large-scale properties across four states for potential 
business and industrial development through 
Duke Energy’s Site Readiness Program.

Under the program, Duke Energy helps identify high-
quality business and industrial sites, then partners with 
local government agencies and economic development 
professionals to build strategies to bring essential 
utilities – water, sewer, natural gas and electricity –  
to the properties.

programs at community colleges, where classes and 
apprenticeships equip students with skills and training 
for tomorrow’s jobs.

Encouraging Civic Participation

Educating lawmakers, policy advocacy and 
participation in America’s democratic process are 
activities Duke Energy encourages.

Civic engagement is essential to ensuring that our 
elected officials hear and understand many voices 
and perspectives as they consider important issues 
and make decisions that can have significant impacts 
on our lives. Policy positions and priorities important 
to Duke Energy include infrastructure, tax and 
regulatory reform, renewables, environmental issues 
and cybersecurity.

Duke Energy’s Political Expenditures Policy requires 
compliance with laws and regulations governing 
political contributions, government interaction and 

lobbying activities. The company is legally prohibited 
from making direct contributions to candidates for U.S. 
federal offices and certain state offices.

Duke Energy’s Voices in Politics network educates and 
activates employees on political and policy issues that 
could affect our operations, employees or stakeholders. 
These efforts are for the purpose of making sure 
lawmakers fully understand the direct impacts of their 
decisions on Duke Energy and the customers and 
communities we serve. 

In 2017, our reportable federal lobbying expenses 
(including office space, salaries, consulting and 
event fees, etc.) included $2,296,5951 in dues 
to support policy research and advocacy by trade 
associations such as the Edison Electric Institute 
and the Nuclear Energy Institute. Duke Energy also 
contributed approximately $918,2002 to Section

Lower-Carbon Energy: Natural 
Gas Pipelines, Power Plants

Natural gas continues to play an 
expanding role in Duke Energy’s 
ongoing transformation into a cleaner, 
lower-carbon energy provider as the 
company increasingly moves away from 
coal-fired electricity generation.

Two new underground interstate  
natural gas pipelines, partly owned  
by Duke Energy, took major steps 
forward in 2017: 

   The Atlantic Coast Pipeline received 
several state and federal government 
approvals, allowing partial construction 
to begin in early 2018. The 
approximately 600-mile pipeline –  
which will start in West Virginia 
and traverse Virginia before ending 
in North Carolina – is scheduled to 
open in late 2019.

 The pipeline will fuel advanced 
natural gas power plants that are 
replacing aging, higher-carbon, 
coal-fired plants. The pipeline also 
will fuel new industrial development 

in several economically challenged 
counties in eastern North Carolina –  
bringing thousands of new, higher-
wage jobs for the region’s workers 
and critically needed new tax revenue 
for cash-strapped local governments.

   Meanwhile, a second new pipeline – 
Sabal Trail – opened after 18 months 
of construction, bringing a significant 
new supply of natural gas to Florida 
to fuel power plants and industry in 
that heavily gas-dependent state. The 
515-mile pipeline begins in Alabama 
and traverses southern Georgia before 
terminating in central Florida. 

Simultaneously, construction of 
new natural gas-fired power plants 
continued in Anderson County, S.C. 
(opening in 2018); Citrus County, Fla. 
(opening in 2018); and Buncombe 
County, N.C. (opening in 2019). The 
three plants will replace older coal-fired 
generating units at each location. The 
new plants also will complement the 
company’s growing use of solar and 
wind facilities, whose power output  
is intermittent.

Natural gas continues 
to play an expanding 
role in Duke Energy’s 
ongoing transformation 
into a cleaner, 
lower-carbon  
energy provider .

Investing in a Smarter Energy  
Future in Multiple Ways

Duke Energy in 2017 continued to invest in a smarter 
energy future in multiple ways:

   Modernizing the energy grid. The company is 

investing $25 billion between 2017 and 2026 to 
create a smarter energy grid that will accommodate 
additional renewable energy and improve system 
performance in many aspects – customer control 
and convenience, security, and service reliability. 
(See related article on page 18: “Electric Grid 
Modernization Continues on Several Fronts.”)

   Generating cleaner energy. The company continues 

to make significant progress in reducing its 
environmental footprint – reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions by closing coal-fired power plants and 
investing $11 billion between 2017 and 2026 in 
cleaner natural gas-fired power plants, solar energy 
and other renewable generation sources.

   Expanding natural gas infrastructure. Natural gas 
will play a major role in Duke Energy’s cleaner 
energy future. The company is investing heavily 
in natural gas-fired power plants and interstate 
natural gas pipelines, and retrofitting three large 
coal-fired power plants to also burn natural gas. 
(See related articles on pages 28 and 36: “Lower-
Carbon Energy: Natural Gas Pipelines, Power 
Plants” and “Gas Co-Firing Offers Many Positive 
Benefits.”)

   Transforming the customer experience. Duke Energy 
exists to serve its customers, and the company is 
working hard to further improve the overall customer 
experience. New technology is shortening and even 
eliminating power outages. Smart meters are giving 
customers new ways to manage and reduce their 
electricity usage, and save money. New electric 
vehicle charging stations are giving customers new 
transportation fuel options.

   Engaging stakeholders. Fortune magazine named 
Duke Energy to its 2018 “World’s Most Admired 
Companies” list – an indication that Duke Energy’s 
many diverse stakeholders recognize and value 
the company’s continued progress on its future-
focused journey. The company continues to 
work collaboratively with regulators, legislators, 
environmentalists, consumer advocates and many 
others on its multipronged modernization initiatives.

Trucks Plug In, Save Fuel 
and Help the Environment

Long-haul trucks idling their engines 
aren’t unusual. Many times it’s for the 
comfort of the driver or the need to 
keep cargo refrigerated.

It also uses about 1 billion gallons 
of fuel a year, according to Argonne 
National Laboratory. That costs roughly 
$3 billion and 11 million tons of carbon 
dioxide released into the environment, 
not to mention wear and tear of engines.

Is there a better way? Duke Energy 
thinks so.

Projects funded by Duke Energy in 
North Carolina are getting drivers and 
companies to use electricity instead of 
running their engines.

At the Big Boy Truck Stop in Johnston 
County, Duke Energy worked with 
IdleAir to install 24 electrification units. 
Truckers pay an hourly fee to plug in. In 
addition to avoiding emissions, truckers 
will save around $1 an hour compared 
to fuel costs.

In Hickory, 36 electric outlets help trucks  
at the Merchants Distributors (MDI) 
distribution center keep cargo cold 
for their fleet of trucks. Shorepower 
Technologies installed the power outlets.

The outlook for future projects looks 
good as companies like MDI see 
electrification as a way to reduce 
environmental emissions and save 
money. The two projects, which are 
part of a 2015 settlement with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency and 
environmental groups, are expected 
to save more than 50,000 gallons of 
diesel fuel a year.

While that’s a small part of the 38 billion  
gallons of diesel fuel used each year 
by trucks on the highway, it’s just one 
part of what Duke Energy is doing 
to promote electricity as a cleaner 
transformation fuel for the country.

The company has been active in 
building hundreds of public charging 
stations at parking decks, libraries and 
shopping areas. That infrastructure is 
needed as electric vehicles become a 
growing part of the nation’s auto fleet, 
and the effort will continue in 2018 
with Duke Energy Florida installing 
more than 500 charging stations.

In North Carolina, Duke Energy is 
continuing a project that will  
ultimately fund more than 200  
public EV charging stations under  
a $1.5 million grant program.

Projects funded by

The company has also factored in the impacts of the 
new federal tax law – and is working constructively 
with our state regulatory commissions to identify ways 
to pass along savings to customers, while also upholding 
the sustainable financial health of the company. 

Duke Energy remains committed to offering an 
attractive long-term investment to its shareholders. 
2018 will mark the 92nd consecutive year we have 
paid a dividend to our shareholders. Duke Energy grew 
that dividend by about 4 percent in 2017.

Duke Energy’s total shareholder return – measured as 
the change in stock price plus the reinvestment of 
dividends – for 2017 was 13.0 percent, compared 
to 12.8 percent for the Philadelphia Utility Index (20 
U.S. utilities) and 21.8 percent for the S&P 500 during 
the same period. Despite solid returns to investors in 
2017, the utility sector trailed the overall market based

Duke Energy is the first U.S. windpower operator to commercially deploy a new technology  
designed to prevent eagle collisions with rotating wind turbine blades.

Protecting Eagles While 
Generating Carbon-Free 
Energy

Duke Energy is installing new eagle 
protection technology at its Top of the 
World Windpower Project in Wyoming 
to detect in-flight eagles and prevent 
their collision with rotating wind  
turbine blades.

Duke Energy is the first windpower 
operator in the U.S. to commercially 
deploy the new system, called 
IdentiFlight, which uses artificial 
intelligence and high-precision optical 
technology to ensure the successful 
coexistence of wind energy and eagles.

The system, designed by IdentiFlight 
International, LLC, will quickly 
detect an eagle flying within a one-
kilometer hemisphere of any one of 
24 IdentiFlight monitoring units being 
installed at the site.

If an eagle’s speed and flight path 
indicate a potential risk of collision 
with a wind turbine, the monitoring 

unit will send an automatic alert to the 
facility’s operators. The operators then 
can immediately shut down the specific 
wind turbine in the eagle’s flight path, 
reducing the risk of collision.

“Duke Energy understands the 
importance of balancing the need to 
generate clean, carbon-free, renewable 
energy with the equally important 
need to protect wildlife, including the 
iconic bald and golden eagles,” says 
Tim Hayes, Duke Energy Renewables 
environmental director.

Adds IdentiFlight president Tom 
Hiester: “Duke Energy has been an 
amazing partner throughout the testing 
and development of the IdentiFlight 
technology, and has proven to be at the 
forefront of the industry in addressing 
this critical issue.”

Piedmont finished the year with a TICR of 1.65 – not 
as positive as the Duke Energy mark, but much better 
than the previous year. In this metric, the lower the 
score, the better.

Duke Energy successfully implemented a summer 
safety campaign, which educated workers about heat-
related illnesses and other warm-weather hazards, and 
a program to effectively address minor injuries through 
a team of on-site nurses. The company will build on 
those successes in 2018 with initiatives focusing on 
hazards, ergonomics and safe driving.

Although pleased with the company’s overall 
performance, two work-related fatalities and three 
life-altering injuries mean there is still work to do. 
Reducing the number of serious injuries will be a focus 
for Duke Energy in 2018 as the company strives to 
have the safest workplace in the industry.

For more than 10 years, Duke Energy has been 
planning for a lower-carbon future, investing in 
innovative technologies to modernize and diversify our 
system, and executing on our strategy to deliver greater 
value and cleaner energy for customers. 

Back in 2005, coal accounted for 58 percent of the 
power the company produced. Fast forward to 2017, 
coal was only 33 percent of the total generation and 
over 38 percent of the power produced was from zero 
carbon sources.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are down 31 percent 
since 2005, and the company has set our sights on 
even greater progress. By 2030, only one-fifth of the 
power Duke Energy produces will be from coal, and  
80 percent of the energy produced will be from zero- 
and lower-CO2 emissions sources.

Duke Energy has set an ambitious goal to reduce total 
CO2 emissions 40 percent by 2030, compared to 
2005 levels, which is consistent with a pathway to 
achieve a science-based climate target.

Reducing reliance on coal, leveraging cleaner natural 
gas energy and expanding renewables on our system is 
part of our long-term investment strategy to continue 
to drive carbon out of our system. As we have done

Gas Co-Firing Offers Many 
Positive Benefits

In the energy industry, the more options 
the better.

That’s part of Duke Energy’s effort to 
allow dual-fuel optionality at some  
of its coal-fired power plants in  
North Carolina.

What is dual-fuel optionality? It allows 
certain generating units to produce 
electricity using either coal and/or 
natural gas – sometimes referred to as 
gas co-firing.

Co-firing provides a number of benefits 
to the company, customers and the 
environment. By using natural gas 
instead of coal, the company can lower 
its overall carbon dioxide emissions.

It also allows the company to take 
advantage of the price difference 
between coal and natural gas. 
Customers save when the company  
can lower its overall fuel costs.

At the Rogers Energy Complex, the 
company is pursuing co-firing up to  
40 percent natural gas at unit 5; and 
100 percent at unit 6.

At the Belews Creek Station, the 
company is looking at co-firing up to 
50 percent natural gas at both of the 
coal units. The company will also invest 

OPERATIONS

2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 36 /

more than $200 million to begin co-firing at all four 
coal units at the Marshall Steam Station.

Co-firing also enables Duke Energy to make the best 
use of its existing power plants and still take advantage 
of attractive natural gas pricing.

The flexibility and cost savings gained by operating 
existing coal units on gas are achieved at a much lower 
capital investment than building a new combined cycle 
power plant. Gas retrofits cost about 10 percent of the 
cost of a new combined-cycle unit.

Collaboration Helps Preserve Shared 
Water Supply

Stakeholder engagement and collaboration are key to 
Duke Energy’s success as a strong community partner 
and environmental steward.

The Catawba-Wateree River Basin, with 11 inter-
connected reservoirs and 13 hydropower stations 
managed by Duke Energy, provides water for nearly  
2 million people and enough electricity to power about 
3.7 million homes. 

The most densely populated river basin in North 
Carolina is facing long-term challenges, with the overall 
water demand expected to more than double by 2065. 

In response, the Catawba-Wateree Water Management 
Group developed a water supply master plan in 2014 
to protect and extend the available water supply of 
the Catawba-Wateree River and its reservoirs by 50 
additional years, to support economic growth into the 
next century.

Created in 2007 during the stakeholder process to  
relicense the Catawba-Wateree Hydroelectric Project, 
the nonprofit corporation includes Duke Energy and  
18 public water utilities in North Carolina and  
South Carolina. 

In May 2017, Duke Energy asked the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) to amend the license 
for the Catawba-Wateree Hydroelectric Project to 
include several key provisions of the new water supply 
master plan. These include raising summer normal 
target elevations by 6 inches on three of the largest 
storage reservoirs – Lake James, Lake Norman and 
Lake Wylie – and revising the basin’s drought response 
protocol to allow Duke Energy’s hydro system to 
respond more quickly to changing drought conditions. 
The FERC approved the license amendment on 
January 22, 2018.  

Raising the summer target lake levels, to be 
implemented following enhancements to Wateree Dam, 
will increase overall available storage by about 8 billion 
gallons, extending the water yield of the Catawba-
Wateree lake system by one decade beyond  
current conditions. 

Water is a limited and shared resource. This 
collaboration between Duke Energy and its regional 
stakeholders places the river basin’s shared water 
supply on a stronger foundation for decades to come.

Keeping Our Infrastructure and 
Information Secure

The headlines on cyberattacks can be alarming,  
but protecting the nation’s energy grid to ensure a 
reliable supply is of paramount importance to the 
electric industry.

Duke Energy builds layers of security to provide rapid 
detection and response to possible cyberattacks. 
The company also focuses on properly isolating any 
impacted devices or systems. For example, in 2017 
the company received 2.2 billion emails to our system. 
More than 94 percent of those did not meet our 
security criteria and were blocked by our controls.

Raising the summer target lake levels will increase overall 
available storage by about 8 billion gallons, extending the water 
yield of the Catawba-Wateree lake system by one decade .

Reliable Power

Reliable power is one of Duke Energy’s core commitments to the more than 24 million 
people we serve . Each year the company sets power delivery reliability targets for the 
number and duration of power outages, and generation fleet performance targets.

Power Delivery

Weather was 40 percent worse (more storms) during the first half of 2017 compared to 
the previous year, resulting in an increase to Duke Energy’s average time without power 
of 10 minutes . During the second half of 2017, weather returned to a normal pattern 
(except for Hurricane Irma), improving average time without power by 3 minutes . The 
average number of outages remained relatively stable .

Debbie Hauliska  /  José Estela  /  Investigators for the Piedmont Natural Gas Anti-Theft Team

Gas Anti-Theft Team Makes 
a Difference

Curbing natural gas theft is a full-time job  
for Debbie Hauliska and José Estela – 
both of whom are investigators for the 
Piedmont Natural Gas anti-theft team.

Their targets are people who steal or 
tamper with natural gas meters, and  
their efforts have cut thefts by 75 percent  
in five years, with the number of cases 
dropping from 2,214 in 2012, to just 
557 at the end of 2017. 

Using cutting-edge technology and 
relationships they’ve formed with local 
law enforcement, Hauliska and Estela 
canvass areas of Charlotte, N.C. looking 
for signs of natural gas theft. Signs 
include covered or altered natural gas 
meters, missing meters, and meters 
with hoses or other tubing used to 
bypass or otherwise alter the flow of 
natural gas.

Tampering with natural gas meters 
can be extremely dangerous, so theft 
detection serves to remove safety 
hazards. This is also an important task 
since the cost of stolen natural gas 
is shared among all customers. But 
Hauliska and Estela’s work is having a 
quieter, more far-reaching positive effect –  

it’s identifying people who need help. 
When the team locates a site where 
natural gas is being stolen or used 
illegally, they are obligated to remove 
the meter and cut off the flow of natural 
gas. But this team recognizes that some 
people steal natural gas because they 
simply can’t afford to pay for it. 

“I carry a card with the number for 
Crisis Assistance on it,” Estela said.  
“I don’t know what’s on the other side 
of that door. I’ll work with you. It’s 
rough out there.”

Crisis Assistance Ministry is an agency 
in Mecklenburg County, N.C., providing 
the working poor with emergency 
rent and utility assistance, clothing, 
household goods and furniture. 
Piedmont Natural Gas supports Crisis 
Assistance Ministry through its Share 
the Warmth program – an optional 
program that rounds up a Piedmont 
customer’s bill to the nearest dollar and 
then donates all the proceeds to help 
people in need pay their utility bills, 
regardless of which utility they use.

Hauliska estimates that since 2012, 
she and Estela have referred at least 
250 families to Crisis Assistance  
for help.

Hauliska and Estela’s 
work is also having a  
quieter, more far-reaching  
positive effect – it’s

Predicting Breakdowns 
Before They Happen

Breakdowns happen to mechanical 
and electrical equipment – including 
Duke Energy power plants. Imagine the 
benefits if the equipment could tell us 
when a breakdown is about to occur.

Duke Energy has an effort underway 
to increase the use of predictive 
maintenance using various sensor 
devices, which is moving the company 
in the right direction.

Right now, more than 30,000 sensors 
are in place on critical company 
machinery at several coal and gas-fired 
power plants. Among other things, a 
breakdown at these plants could mean 
less efficient plants would be brought 
online to take their place. A negative 
both financially and environmentally.

Predictive maintenance examines data 
gathered from sensors on large pieces 
of equipment – like transformers at a 
power plant. Company experts can sort 
through the data to find irregularities 
that suggest a breakdown is likely.

From there, company technicians can 
apply analytical tools or physically 
examine the equipment to gather 
additional data to see if any action  
is needed.

An example at the Sutton Power Plant 
in North Carolina illustrates how the 
process works:

Data gathered by the sensors indicated 
a breakdown might occur at a main 
transformer at the plant. An in-person 
inspection confirmed the finding.

But there was one problem: The 
weather was extremely cold during that 
time, and the plant was needed to meet 
the critically high demand for electricity.

In the end, the transformer was 
closely monitored for a short time 

until the extreme cold subsided and 
the transformer was fixed before any 
breakdown occurred. 

Duke Energy’s team has dozens of such  
examples where data gathered from 
sensors helped solve a potential problem.

In the future, Duke Energy will continue 
to use new technologies to maintain 
reliability at its power plants – making 
sure the cleanest and most cost-
effective plants are running to meet  
the needs of its customers.

Coal Ash Basin Work 
Progressing Well

Work at coal ash basins across the 
states Duke Energy serves was bustling 
in 2017 as the company continued 
excavating at some sites and preparing 
other basins for safe closure.

The company has proposed a 
combination of excavating some basins 
and capping others in place with a 
synthetic barrier based on site-specific 
engineering and scientific studies.

All closure plans will be designed 
to protect the environment and 
communities we serve. In addition to 
meeting state and federal requirements, 
these closure plans help manage costs 
for customers, minimize community 
disruption and mirror how most utilities 
across the nation will close basins.

To date, the company has safely 
excavated and relocated nearly 17 
million tons of ash systemwide, with  
7.2 million tons removed in 2017.

At operating coal plants, the company 
is investing in the technology needed 
to take ash basins out of service. 
This includes constructing new, 
lined retention basins for wastewater 
management, installing state-of-the-
art treatment systems and adding new 
equipment to manage bottom ash in a 

An effort underway to 
increase the use of 
predictive maintenance

dry form. These plants have been managing fly ash in 
lined landfills for a number of years.

Duke Energy continues to look for innovative ways 
to recycle and reuse coal ash. Overall, Duke Energy 
successfully recycled about 70 percent of the coal ash 
produced at its operating power plants in 2017.

A valuable construction material, ash makes concrete 
products stronger and more durable. The company 
has announced ash reprocessing units at three sites 
in North Carolina that will make nearly 1 million 
additional tons of ash suitable for the concrete 
industry. This will enhance the company’s ability 
to recycle basin ash that typically can’t be used for 
concrete without additional processing.

Carbon-Free Nuclear Yields Another 
Stellar Year

As Duke Energy’s largest carbon-free energy resource, 
operating an efficient nuclear fleet is critical to 
customers and the environment.

Duke Energy’s 11 nuclear generating units posted a 
strong operating performance in 2017, providing  
North Carolina and South Carolina with nearly  
90 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity – more 
than 50 percent of the electricity generation in those 
two states and about one-third of the company’s entire 
generation output.

Nuclear generation avoided the release of 82 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2017 – as much as is 
released from more than 17 million passenger vehicles 
during a year.

A few highlights:

   The company’s fleet achieved a combined capacity 
factor of more than 95 percent, which is above the 
national average. It was the 19th consecutive year 
the fleet capacity factor exceeded 90 percent.

   Both Catawba Nuclear Station and Harris Nuclear 

Plant set records for the amount of energy produced 
in a 12-month period.

   Both units at McGuire Nuclear Station posted their 
shortest ever refueling outages, thus maximizing 
their availability for generation.

   A unit at Brunswick Nuclear Plant achieved a record 

operating run of almost 712 consecutive days.

   A unit at Oconee Nuclear Station accomplished a 

record operating run of more than 715 consecutive 
days, which is also a new company record.

   The Robinson Nuclear Plant team completed the 
station’s 30th refueling outage, which included a 
main generator stator replacement, well ahead  
of schedule.

The company is currently evaluating the possibility of 
seeking additional license extensions from the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission for its currently operating 
nuclear plants. This would allow the generating units 
to operate up to 80 years if it makes economic sense 
and provides benefits to customers.

As for building new nuclear plants, Duke Energy 
notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that it 
does not intend to build previously planned units 
in Levy County, Florida. Duke Energy maintains its 
licenses for two new nuclear units near Gaffney, S.C., 
as an option for future generation.

Water withdrawn and consumed 
for electric generation
Water withdrawn is the total volume removed 
from a water source, such as a lake or a river . 
Because of the once-through cooling systems 
on many of our coal-fired and nuclear plants, 
almost 99 percent of this water is returned to 
the source and available for other uses . Water 
consumed is the amount of water removed for 
use and not returned to the source .

Emissions from electric generation
Many factors influence emissions levels and 
intensities, including generation diversity and 
efficiency, demand for electricity, weather, fuel 
availability and prices, and emissions controls 
deployed . Since 2005, our carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions decreased by 31 percent, 
sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions decreased 
by 96 percent and nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
emissions decreased by 75 percent . These 
decreases are primarily due to addition of 
pollution control equipment, decreased coal 
generation, increased natural gas generation, 
and replacement of higher-emitting plants .

Methane emissions from  
pipeline operations
Methane (CH4) is the primary component of 
natural gas, and is a greenhouse gas . We 
work to minimize methane emissions, but 
some is released during pipeline operations 
and maintenance . Duke Energy is a founding 
partner of the U .S . EPA’s Natural Gas Star 
Methane Challenge program, which is aimed 
at cost-effective technologies and practices 
that improve operational efficiency and reduce 
methane emissions .

Sulfur hexafluoride emissions  
from electric transmission and 
distribution operations
Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an insulating gas 
used in high-voltage electric transmission

is a greenhouse gas . We work to minimize 
SF6 emissions, but some is released during 
transmission and distribution operations  
and maintenance .

Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
Duke Energy’s TRI releases for 2016 were 
down 84 percent from 2007, primarily due 
to the significant investments we’ve made in 
environmental controls for our power plants, 
and decreased coal generation . (Data for 2017 
will be available in August 2018 .)

Waste
We met our goal of increasing the percentage 
of solid waste that is recycled from 69 percent 
in 2013 to 80 percent in 2018 one year early . 
(This goal excludes Duke Energy Renewables, 
which has a relatively small waste stream .)

Fully Paid Parental Leave for 
Duke Energy’s Moms, Dads 

Duke Energy in 2017 began offering its 
employees fully paid parental leave –  
totaling six weeks – to bolster work-
family balance and help attract and 
retain highly skilled workers.

The new benefit catapulted Duke 
Energy to near the front of the pack 
among the nation’s largest electric 
utilities, many of which do not offer 
dedicated paid parental leave.

Under Duke Energy’s new benefit – 
available to both mothers and fathers –  
an employee can start the six-week 
paid leave any time within the first  
16 weeks after the birth, adoption or 
foster care placement of a child.

A birth mother can take a total of at 
least 12 weeks’ paid time off: at least 
six weeks through the company’s 
existing, pregnancy-related short-
term disability benefit, followed by 
six additional weeks under the new 
parental leave benefit.

“Paid parental leave gives Duke Energy 
employees important quality time to 
bond with their new children without 
the financial pressure of having to 
immediately return to work. That’s good 
for our employees and their children,” 
says Melissa Anderson, Duke Energy 
executive vice president and chief 
human resources officer.

Duke Energy’s other family-focused 
employee benefits include a $5,000 
reimbursement for costs associated 
with adopting a child; paid time off to 
care for a sick or injured child, parent 
or other family member; and 10 hours 
of paid time off each year to volunteer 
in an employee’s child’s school, or any 
other school.

Duke Energy employs about 29,000 
workers – most of them in North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, 
Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.

Powering Economies Through 
Workforce Development 

Free Legal Assistance: Helping Those  
in Need 

A growing issue for Duke Energy and many businesses 
is the gap between demand for skilled STEM workers 
and available talent to fill open positions. One of the 
ways the company is closing the gap is through our 
investments in education and workforce development. 

During 2017, our Duke Energy Foundation invested 
more than $33 million in charitable support for local 
organizations, many of which are implementing 
innovative programs to attract and train STEM 
professionals. Workforce development starts as early 
as possible – a reason why investments in quality 
education span kindergarten through career. 

In central Florida, Duke Energy is working to bolster 
the area’s existing skilled workforce by investing  
in Lake-Sumter State College’s (LSSC) energy  
technology programs.

Graduates of these programs enter the workforce 
in high-paying and in-demand jobs. These career 
specialties are critical to the energy industry as utilities 
work to maintain and upgrade the electric grid in 
Florida and throughout the country. In 2017, the 
company announced a $110,000 gift to support LSSC, 
and already Duke Energy has hired graduates of these 
programs to fill critical roles at the company. 

In North Carolina, Duke Energy is successfully 
partnering with the Urban League of Central Carolinas 
to provide a test prep class for students interested 
in becoming entry-level electrical lineworkers. This 
eight-week Duke Energy Construction Skills and Trade 
(CAST) test prep course is an opportunity for job  
seekers to gain entrance into well-paying line technician,  
solar, construction and other utility positions. 

These are just a few of the many workforce 
development programs the company is investing in 
across its service footprint – building a talent pipeline 
that will power regional economies for years to come.  

Duke Energy’s 70 attorneys, along with 70 paralegals 
and other legal support staff, provide a wide range of 
free legal assistance to those in need.

It’s part of the company’s strong commitment to 
serving individuals, families and communities beyond 
just providing electricity and natural gas.

   Neighborhood Legal Clinic – In Indianapolis, 

company attorneys and legal support staff partner 
with a nonprofit group to provide free legal 
assistance to low-income households, including 
immigrant families. 

   Alexander Youth Network – In Charlotte, attorneys 
and support staff in recent years have provided 
free legal services to Alexander Youth Network, a 
nonprofit organization that treats children who have 
serious emotional and behavioral challenges.

   Legal Aid Organizations – In St. Petersburg and 

Tallahassee, Fla., attorneys and support staff partner 
with nonprofit legal aid organizations to provide free 
legal assistance to low-income clients on matters 
ranging from family law to domestic violence to 
bankruptcy and foreclosure.

   Wills for Seniors – In Raleigh, N.C., attorneys and 
support staff partner with a church and a law firm 
to prepare wills and other documents, including 
health care powers of attorney and durable powers 
of attorney, for senior citizens.

   Small Business Assistance – In Cincinnati, attorneys 

and support staff partner with the University of 
Cincinnati’s law school to provide free legal services 
to small businesses.

   Criminal Record Expunction – In Charlotte, N.C., 

attorneys and support staff partner with the 
Charlotte Center for Legal Advocacy and a law firm 
to provide free criminal record expunction petitions 
for eligible individuals who face difficulty getting 
jobs or housing due to an arrest on their record 
from years ago.

With internal programs and a growing list of external recognitions,  
workplace diversity and inclusion remains a strong asset for Duke Energy.

Cultivating a Diverse and 
Inclusive Environment 

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is critical 
as we transform to better serve our 
customers and local communities. That’s  
why Duke Energy joined a national 
coalition of business leaders pledging  
to advance D&I in the workplace. 

Launched in June 2017, CEO Action 
for Diversity & Inclusion™ brings 
together business leaders committing 
themselves – and the organizations they 
lead – to take concrete actions to foster 
a diverse and inclusive environment. 

The CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion  
represents nearly 70 industries, all 
50 states and millions of employees 
globally. Organizations joining the pledge  
commit to taking three initial actions:

1.   Cultivate workplaces that support 
open dialogue on complex, and 
sometimes difficult, conversations 
about diversity and inclusion;

2.   Implement and expand unconscious 

bias education; and

3.   Share best practices with  
member companies. 

Duke Energy is firmly committed to 
supporting diversity and inclusion in 
our workplace and the communities we 
serve. Recent recognition underscores 
the progress we’re making, including 
recognition from Human Rights 
Campaign as a “Best Place to Work 
for LGBT Equality” and Forbes as one 
of the “Best Employers for Diversity.” 
Among the D&I programs that  
Duke Energy offers are: 

   A 20-year-old network of Employee 

Resource Groups representing 
African-Americans, Hispanics, 
women, people with disabilities, new 
employees, veterans and the LGBT 
community that work to address the 
needs of employees, communities 
and customers. 

   Diversity Councils that sponsor 

local D&I education and awareness 
activities, and support our diverse 
customers through volunteerism and 
community outreach.

   An unconscious bias training program 
that was piloted with 75 leaders in 
2016 and expanded to include an 
additional 477 leaders in 2017.

CEO Action for Diversity 
& Inclusion™ brings

Non-GAAP Financial Information

Non-GAAP Measures
Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP 
financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. These 
items represent income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy, 
adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items . As discussed 
below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management 
believes are not indicative of Duke Energy’s ongoing performance . Management 
believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides 
useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant 
comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods .

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and 
forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of 
Directors (Board of Directors), employees, stockholders, analysts and investors . 
Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses . The 
most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted 
diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP 
Reported Earnings) and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation 
common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively .

Special items included in the periods presented include the following, which 
management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

•   Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from  

strategic acquisitions .

•   Cost Savings Initiatives represent severance charges related to companywide 

initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize processes and 
systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization .

•   Regulatory Settlements in 2017 represent charges related to the Levy nuclear 
project in Florida and the Mayo Zero Liquid Discharge and Sutton combustion

Adjusted earnings also include the operating results of the nonregulated Midwest 
generation business and Duke Energy Retail Sales (collectively, the Midwest 
Generation Disposal Group) and the International Disposal Group, which have 
been classified as discontinued operations. Management believes inclusion 
of the operating results of the Disposal Groups within adjusted earnings and 
adjusted diluted EPS results in a better reflection of Duke Energy’s financial 
performance during the period .

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other 
companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner .

The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted
