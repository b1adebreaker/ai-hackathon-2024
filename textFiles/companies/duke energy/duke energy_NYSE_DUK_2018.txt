TRANSFORMING THE

FUTURE

Duke Energy 2018 Sustainability Report

A TRIBUTE TO A LEADING VOICE FOR SUSTAINABILITY

Jim Rogers (1947-2018) was a leading voice for sustainability. As CEO of Cinergy (a predecessor  
company of Duke Energy), he steered the company to produce its first-ever Sustainability Report in 
2003. After merging with Duke Energy in 2006, he carried on that legacy as CEO of the new company.

His message in the 2003 report still rings true today: “Sustainability is about providing for the energy 
needs of our customers without compromising the potential of future generations to inherit a better, 
more productive society.”

A year of achievement

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO

Sustainability has steadily transformed over the years from concept to reality; from a 
good idea to a great way to do business. Today, sustainability is integral to how any 
smart company operates.

Duke Energy has been leading the charge to a cleaner energy future while helping our 
communities thrive. We’ve made significant progress on all fronts – from conservation 
and energy efficiency to the sustainable use of natural resources and generation of 
cleaner energy. We’ve reduced our carbon emissions by 31 percent from our 2005 
levels and remain on track to reach our goal of 40 percent by 2030. All the while, 
we’ve kept rates for all customer classes below the national average. 

And that’s just the start. 

We’re looking at ways to accelerate the move to cleaner energy because we know it’s 
right for our customers, our communities and society at large. The lower-carbon future 
we all want requires a delicate balancing act with no one-size-fits-all solution, as it 
must be safe, reliable and affordable for all customers regardless of where they live. 

Last year, we captured our commitment to reduce carbon emissions in our Climate 
Report – consistent with the goals of the Paris Accord. Our comprehensive plan 
through 2030 includes the retirement of coal and the investment in renewables, 
battery technologies, energy efficiency and natural gas. Our plan is also founded in a 
firm belief that carbon-free nuclear power – the workhorse of our fleet – is an essential 
part of any equation for a low-carbon future.

As we look decades beyond 2030, innovation and collaboration will be key as the 
industry moves toward a carbon-neutral energy supply that will support electrification 
and help reduce carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy. We are strong 
proponents of research and development focused on discovering the solutions that 
will allow us to make progress while maintaining the round-the-clock reliability our 
customers depend on. 

LEADING THE CHARGE

Duke Energy has been 
leading the charge 
to a cleaner energy 
future while helping our 
communities thrive.

INTRODUCTIONSMARTER ENERGY DECISIONS

We installed 1.6 million smart meters last year, giving 62 percent of our 
total customers access to real-time information to help make smarter 
energy decisions.

We must work together to find solutions. Everything 
we collectively do – from championing research and 
development to finding consensus with legislators 
and stakeholders – is paramount in realizing this 
important vision. 

2018 Results

2018 marked significant progress on our sustainability 
goals. Highlights include: 

 ■ We continued to transition from coal to natural gas, 
bringing online two new combined-cycle natural gas 
plants and retiring two coal units. We also retrofitted 
two coal units at our Rogers Energy Complex to run 
on natural gas and coal – rather than coal only. 

 ■ As of year-end 2018, we owned or contracted over 

7,100 megawatts of wind, solar and biomass energy. 
This includes 500 megawatts of solar added in 
North Carolina during the year, which helped the 
state remain second in the nation for solar capacity.

 ■ Our energy efficiency initiatives helped customers 
reduce energy consumption and peak demand 
by more than 16,700 gigawatt-hours and 
5,900 megawatts, respectively, since 2008. This 
reduction in consumption is more than the annual 
usage of 1.25 million homes, and the peak demand 
reduction is equivalent to 10 power plants each 
producing 600 megawatts. 

 ■ We installed 1.6 million smart meters last year, giving 
62 percent of our total customers access to real-time 
information to help make smarter energy decisions. 

 ■ We issued $1 billion in green bonds to finance green 
energy projects in North Carolina and South Carolina 
– one of the largest green bond transactions in 
our industry. 

 ■ Our nuclear fleet achieved a 93 percent capacity 
factor, marking the 20th consecutive year above 
90 percent. 

 ■ We outlined plans to deploy 300 megawatts of 

battery storage projects in the Carolinas over the next 
15 years.

 ■ We safely removed 4.9 million tons of coal ash this 
year and recycled nearly 80 percent of what was 
produced at operating power plants. 

A New Era of Energy 

Moving forward, it is essential we have the right 
strategy, the right pace of change and the right people 
to meet our goals, especially in the rapidly evolving 
sustainability landscape. It’s the only way we’ll find 
solutions to anticipate and meet our customers’ needs. 

I invite you to learn more about our progress 
in the following pages. I’m proud of how our 
30,000 employees are executing our strategy and 
responding to change to build a smarter energy future. 

Our results in 2018 have set the stage to achieve our 
long-term vision. Societal change is never easy, but 
we recognize it is our responsibility to leave a lasting, 
positive impact. Our work continues, and I look forward 
to ushering in this new era for the betterment of those 
we serve today and future generations.

ABOUT THIS REPORT

Change is constant in the energy industry. Whether it’s technology, policy or customer expectations, the spectrum 
of issues in Duke Energy’s 13th Sustainability Report is much different than when the first publication was issued 
in 2007.

Successful companies are those that recognize and adapt to the changing landscape of today’s energy industry. 
The facts and figures in the annual Sustainability Report are key measures of the progress being made in this 
transformation. The numbers continue to show a company shifting from coal to natural gas, relying more on 
renewable energy, reducing environmental impact and modernizing the energy grid to support new technologies.

Duke Energy’s sustainability goals reflect a continued need to improve and excel. The company’s approach to 
business is complemented with efforts to engage stakeholders, embrace innovation, exceed customer expectations 
and positively impact communities.

In this year’s report, you will read real-life examples of how Duke Energy is living up to its sustainability 
principles. As always, we aim to make sure our information is clearly presented and paints an accurate picture 
of the company. We are proud of the positive results we have achieved and are focused on further opportunities 
for improvement.

In addition to this Sustainability Report, you can find a detailed Global Reporting Initiative Index on our website. 
Duke Energy is also participating in the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Association sustainability 
reporting initiative.

Thank you for your interest in the 2018 Sustainability Report and Duke Energy.

INTRODUCTIONOUR STAKEHOLDERS AND WHAT MATTERS MOST 

Our Stakeholders

What Matters Most

Duke Energy’s approach to sustainability focuses on 
the issues that are most important to our stakeholders 
and to us. We identify issues from a variety of sources 
such as stakeholder feedback, surveys, thought leader 
perspectives, social and traditional media coverage, and 
shareholder proposals in our sector.

We have mapped our priority issues to the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which 
aim to “end poverty, protect the planet and ensure 
prosperity for all.” Since their development in 2015, 
the 17 SDGs have gained traction with stakeholders 
concerned about sustainability issues. While there was 
alignment between our priorities and several of the 
SDGs, goals “Seven: Affordable and Clean Energy,” and 
“Thirteen: Climate Action,” are especially applicable to 
our company. 

The graphic depicts the relationship among 
Duke Energy, its stakeholders and the most important 
issues as overlapping circles within circles to show that 
they are interconnected. The stakeholders and issues 
are both arranged alphabetically to make it clear that 
they are all important while safety, as always, is our 
No. one priority. 

Engagement and collaboration with our stakeholders 
underpins Duke Energy’s business strategy.

The company has a rich history of engaging with a 
diverse range of stakeholders, many of whom have 
differing views from us. Now more than ever, it is 
critical that we all work together to find common 
ground and work to transform our collective 
energy future. 

We achieve better outcomes for our customers through 
collaboration. Recognizing the value of sustained 
engagement, we continue to expand our stakeholder 
engagement capabilities. Every stakeholder has a 
different priority, but they are all important. We 
work to understand those priorities and be open 
to compromise. Our goal is to find innovative and 
transparent solutions that effectively address these 
many competing interests.

Our jurisdictions currently have Advisory or Listening 
Councils. These councils provide an opportunity for 
Duke Energy to hear people from diverse stakeholder 
groups as the company develops and adapts its long-
term business plans. 

We are also making changes to solicit stakeholder 
input earlier than ever. For example, during a recent 
transmission siting project, the company worked with 
the local communities and landowners to understand 
the unique historic and cultural sensitives, which led to 
significant changes to the final route selection. 

Our business is different than most. The vitality of 
our communities depends upon energy, so we lack 
the option to stop making our product in the face 
of opposition. Therefore, we must find new ways to 
engage with stakeholders and find solutions that are 
workable for all to provide cleaner, affordable and 
reliable energy for our customers.

Expanded Referral Program Delivers 
Energy Efficiency

As customer expectations change, Duke Energy is 
working to better serve our customers. 

Duke Energy’s Referral Network launched its Find It 
Duke campaign to help customers find professionals 
for home improvement services such as attic insulation 
and HVAC and water heating repair and replacement. 
Contractors in the network can assist customers in 
qualifying for up to $1,450 in rebates for upgrades.

At the new Find It Duke website, customers can track 
the status of an existing rebate application, use a 
cost estimator tool to estimate savings, find special 
discounts on energy-efficient products and services 
and get tips on saving energy. 

The program has doubled the number of referrals 
each year since 2016 with more than 21,000 referrals 
generated in 2018 in the Carolinas. The program 
expanded to Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio in 2018. 

In addition to new programs, Duke Energy customers 
continue to benefit from established programs. Since 
2009, the company has delivered more than 90 million 
energy-efficient lighting products to residential 
customers at deeply discounted prices. Newly 
expanded options for lamps and fixtures provide even 
more energy-efficient solutions for customers.

LEDs use up to 66 percent less energy and last 
24 times longer than traditional bulbs, leading to 
savings on customers’ bills. Eligible customers can 
receive lighting options at participating retailers, 
accessing company-offered programs and by visiting 
the online store.

The company continues to expand its portfolio of 
energy efficiency programs to help the environment and 
customers get the most value for their money.

Duke Energy Restores Power After Two 
Major Hurricanes 

Duke Energy crews responded to massive customer 
power outages after two back-to-back hurricanes struck 
the company’s southeast U.S. service area in fall 2018.

Hurricane Florence

In September, Hurricane Florence made landfall 
and slowly moved inland through North Carolina 
and South Carolina, cutting power to more than 
1.8 million Duke Energy customers and causing historic 
flooding, widespread structural damage and multiple 
highway closures.

Though the flooding and road closures presented 
major challenges, repair crews restored power to 
nearly 1.2 million customers within three days after 
the hurricane’s landfall, and most of the remaining 
customers within seven days.

In advance of the hurricane, Duke Energy staged 
more than 20,000 repair workers – its own and 
those provided by other utility companies nationwide 
– in what was Duke Energy’s largest storm resource 
mobilization ever.

Duke Energy earned the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 
“Emergency Recovery Award” for the company’s power 
restoration efforts after Hurricane Florence.

CUSTOMERS| Duke Energy electrical substation immersed in floodwaters after Hurricane Florence.

“Duke Energy’s crews worked tirelessly in hazardous 
conditions to quickly and safely restore power,” said 
EEI President Tom Kuhn. “They are truly deserving of 
this award.”

Hurricane Michael

In October, Hurricane Michael ripped through the Florida 
Panhandle with 155 mph winds and record storm 
surges before speeding north into Alabama, Georgia, 
South Carolina and North Carolina as a downgraded 
– but still powerful – tropical storm. In Florida, the 
category 4 hurricane destroyed entire Gulf Coast 
communities, demolishing houses, apartment buildings, 
shopping centers and much of the electric grid.

Duke Energy crews restored power to more than 
75,000 Florida customers in the immediate aftermath 
of the storm.

They also began the longer-term task of rebuilding 
obliterated sections of the Panhandle’s electric grid, 
including transmission towers, utility poles, substations 
and transformers.

One day after striking Florida, what became Tropical 
Storm Michael hit the Carolinas, cutting power to more 
than 1 million Duke Energy customers, most of them 
in North Carolina. More than 10,000 repair workers 
restored power to most customers within five days.

“It was a challenging month-long period for our 
customers and employees, who endured back-to-back 
historic storms,” said Harry Sideris, Duke Energy’s chief 
distribution officer.

Shared Solar Shines on All Customers

Shared Solar, sometimes referred to as Community 
Solar, allows customers to benefit from renewable energy 
without having to have solar panels at their premises.

In South Carolina, the company’s first Shared Solar 
program kicked off in 2018. Additional facilities are 
expected online in South Carolina in 2019, with 
expansion in other states planned.

Customers joining the program pay a one-time 
application fee and a monthly subscription cost to fund 
their share of supporting the operation of a solar facility 
located in Dillon County. 

The company is waiving the application cost and 
upfront fees for qualified low-income customers to 
make the offering more widely available. By subscribing 
to the Shared Solar Program, customers receive a 
monthly credit from Duke Energy equal to the amount 
of solar energy the customer’s share produces.

The Dillon County facility was recently named The 
Whitney M. Slater Shared Solar Facility to honor a local 
community resident. Slater was a Darlington, South 
Carolina, nursing student attending North Carolina State 
University when she died of breast cancer at the age 
of 21. After receiving her diagnosis, she made it her 
mission to raise awareness about environmental health 
and breast cancer. Her mother attended the ceremony 
to kick off the program in August.

The 7-megawatt facility has more than 20,000 solar 
panels, and supplies more than 1,000 homes during 
peak output. Expect Shared Solar offerings from the 
company to continue to grow.

2018 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   18

CUSTOMERSGrid Improvements Help Keep 
the Power On 

Duke Energy’s multiyear grid 
improvement initiative advanced 
significantly through 2018, providing 
increased benefits to customers and 
demonstrating the value of smart 
technologies during historic storms that 
impacted the company’s service area.  

Duke Energy is making strategic, 
data-driven investments across its 
six-state service area to improve 
reliability, strengthen the grid against 
cyber and physical threats, expand 
solar and innovative technologies, and 
provide customers with the intelligent 
information they need to make smart 
energy choices and save money. 

The company’s smart-thinking grid 
technology, which is currently being 
installed in every state it serves, quickly 
identifies outages and automatically 
reroutes power to restore customers – 
often in less than a minute – and can 
help to reduce the number of customers 
affected by an outage by as much 
as 75 percent. A smart-thinking grid 
also supports the two-way power flow 
needed to effectively integrate rooftop 
solar and other distributed technologies.  

Smart-thinking technologies delivered 
significant benefits to customers 
during Hurricane Florence by helping 
to avoid more than 80,000 extended 
customer outages and keeping the 
power on for thousands of customers 
when they needed it most. These 
self-healing technologies also aided 
power restoration in Florida following 
Hurricane Michael in October. In total, 

around 700,000 extended outages were 
avoided across the company’s smart-
thinking grid in 2018, saving customers 
1.58 million hours of outage time.  

Following Hurricane Michael and a 
major winter storm in December, crews 
working in areas where smart meters 
have been deployed were able to “ping” 
meters at homes and businesses along 
repaired electric lines to instantly 
determine if power was restored or if 
more repairs were needed. Previously, 
this work could only be done by 
manually patrolling each power line to 
confirm restorations. This smart meter 
technology helped to shorten final 
restorations after recent major storms by 
up to two days, on average.

Duke Energy has also delivered 
improved options and control for 
customers in 2018 through smart 
meter deployments taking place in the 
Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. 

With about 5 million already deployed, 
smart meters are delivering information 
to help customers take control of their 
energy use and save energy and money 
before their bill arrives. They also 
provide improved outage detection and 
can help to speed restoration following a 
major outage. 

Additional work in 2018 included grid 
hardening activities, physical and cyber 
security improvements and targeted 
undergrounding of outage-prone lines, 
all of which will help deliver a better 
experience for customers when the next 
storm strikes.

STRATEGIC 
INVESTMENTS

Duke Energy is making 
strategic, data-driven 
investments across its 
six-state service area 
to improve reliability, 
strengthen the grid 
against cyber and 
physical threats, and 
expand solar and 
innovative technologies.

priority for Duke Energy to reliably 
serve customers now and in the future. 

Transforming the 
Customer Experience

At Duke Energy, the customer is at 
the center of our mission. Evolving 
customer expectations, emerging 
technologies and changing public 
policies all converge to create a 
dynamic environment for Duke Energy 
and the industry. 

Duke Energy is working to build 
genuine connections with all 
customers by listening, anticipating 
their needs and offering solutions. 
The company is now using Net 
Promoter Score, a metric that 
tracks customer loyalty and helps 
the company get better insight into 
improving customer satisfaction.  

Using data and analytics, the company 
is executing a long-term, customer-
focused strategy designed to deliver 
greater value to our customers. 

An example of this work is a builder 
and developer portal and mobile 
app that is designed to provide more 
transparency in our service – making 
project management for these 
customers easier and more consistent.

These tools allow builders to easily 
access the most updated information

Duke Energy Affirms Support for 
Human Rights 

Since the company was founded more than a century 
ago, Duke Energy has made respect for our employees’ 
and communities’ rights a fundamental belief inherent in 
the way we operate. To amplify this belief, the company 
adopted a Human Rights Policy in April 2019 that 
outlines policies and practices that support an ongoing 
commitment to, and respect for, human rights.  

Duke Energy respects international human rights 
principles, including those identified in the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights. The company’s Code of Business Ethics 
and Supplier Code of Conduct provide the backbone to 
the commitments outlined in the human rights policy, 
which include:

 ■ Workforce: We uphold human and workplace 

rights in all our operations, treat workers fairly and 
without discrimination and provide working conditions 
that reflect the human dignity of the people working 
at Duke Energy. Furthermore, we prohibit the 
use of forced labor, child labor and any form of 
human trafficking.  

 ■ Communities and Stakeholders: Duke Energy 

respects the rights of people in the communities it 
serves and seeks to operate the business in ways 
that protect the environment and mitigate adverse 
impacts from operations.

 ■ Suppliers and Partners: Duke Energy expects its 
suppliers of goods and services to adhere to the 
same beliefs that the company has prioritized, 
applying them to how they do business locally and 
around the world.    

Duke Energy engages an independent, third-party 
vendor to operate its EthicsLine, which is available 
24 hours a day, seven days a week, via phone or 
online. Employees, suppliers, customers and other 
stakeholders can report a human rights concern 
through the EthicsLine, which provides anonymity, or 
directly to the company. 

Adherence to and respect for human rights is more 
than a verbal commitment at Duke Energy. It’s an 
ongoing process of learning, evaluating and improving 
how we operate. Duke Energy will conduct periodic 
human rights assessments to determine whether its 
processes and systems used to identify and investigate 
any alleged violations are appropriate, and will publicly 
report on its human rights-related commitments in the 
annual Sustainability Report.

Supplier Relationships Advance  
Company Goals 

To provide electricity, natural gas, and 
renewable energy to our customers, 
Duke Energy purchased more than 
$12 billion worth of goods and services 
in 2018.

Our supplier partners share the 
company’s commitment to the local 
economies and communities we serve. 
We spent more than $4 billion with 
local suppliers in 2018, and our annual 
spending with minority-, women-, 
veteran-, service-disabled veteran-
owned and HUBZone businesses 
has exceeded $1 billion every year 
since 2015.

Duke Energy is committed to 
environmental stewardship and partners 
with vendors who are themselves 
environmentally friendly and support 
the company’s sustainability goals. 
Many of those suppliers are also locally 
based and/or diverse. Duke Energy’s 
expectations for suppliers are described 
in detail in our Supplier Code of 
Conduct, which was updated in 2018. 

Our suppliers help us create a better 
energy future. In 2018, more than 
100 individuals representing about 
40 companies attended the third annual 
Duke Energy Supplier Exchange Forum. 
The company recognized key suppliers 
for excellence in corporate responsibility, 
diversity and safety – all important 
aspects of the company’s supply 
chain objectives.

With the inclusion of local and diverse 
suppliers as one of the company’s 
priorities, Duke Energy was honored 
for having a Top Veteran-Friendly 
Supplier Diversity Program by the 
U.S. Veterans magazine.

Our efforts to identify and recruit 
diverse suppliers are important to the 
company’s overall supply chain sourcing 
strategy. The relationships we have 
with state and community economic 
development organizations (veteran-
related and others) enables Duke to 
positively impact our communities 
while creating enhanced value for 
the company.

10 times more than Duke Energy has 
online today.

In addition to simply storing energy for 
use at another time, battery storage 
can help expand the development 
of renewable energy and support a 
modernized energy grid.

The company announced plans to bring 
300 MW of battery storage in the 
Carolinas online over the next 15 years – 
a $500 million investment.

In western North Carolina, the company 
has one battery project online in 
Haywood County, with two others set 
to be online in 2020 in Buncombe and 
Madison counties.

In Indiana, Duke Energy is planning to 
install a 5-MW battery storage system 
and 3 MW of solar that will operate as a 
microgrid at the Indiana National Guard’s 
Camp Atterbury training operation. 

In Maryland, a similar microgrid 
project went online in 2018 at two 
government facilities.

The microgrid – connected energy 
sources like solar and a battery – can 
serve a customer on its own. It can also 
help with reliability and grid security.

Battery storage can not only store excess 
energy for when its needed, it can also 
control energy flow inside power lines, 
which results in fewer outages and flickers.

For example, clouds moving over solar 
panels and winds changing throughout 
the day lead to fluctuations in energy 
supply. For the energy grid, which 
depends on a perfect match between 
energy produced and customer demand, 
it’s difficult to manage.

Even a slight change in frequency or 
voltage can cause interruptions in 
power to a home or business. When 
needed, batteries can react in a fraction 
of a second to absorb the swings and 
stabilize the flow of energy.

Of course, batteries are not the only 
energy storage method. The company has 
more than 2,000 MW of pumped storage 
hydro power. Over the next few years, 
Duke Energy will increase the capacity 
at its Bad Creek facility in South Carolina 
by more than 300 MW as it upgrades 
the facility.

GROWTH| Duke Energy continues to build large solar power facilities in multiple states.

In Many Ways, Solar Power Keeps Growing 

Solar, in all shapes and sizes, was the big renewable 
energy story at Duke Energy in 2018.

Driven by rebate programs and other incentives, 
Duke Energy’s number of rooftop solar customers in 
our regulated states rose around 30 percent during 
the year. Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina 
remain the top Duke Energy states for privately owned 
solar systems, with more than 30,000 customers 
owning facilities.

In Florida, the 74.9-megawatt (MW) Hamilton Solar 
Plant came online in Jasper – making it the company’s 
largest solar facility to date.

In 2018, Duke Energy broke ground on the Columbia 
Solar Power Plant in Fort White, Florida. Duke Energy 
will own, operate and maintain the 74.9-MW facility, 
which is expected to be fully operational in 2020. In 
March 2019, the company announced three more solar 
projects in Florida, totaling 195 MW, that are expected 
to be in service in late 2019 or early 2020.

In the Carolinas, the company continues to roll out 
new offerings for customers interested in solar power. 
In its first two years, around 3,000 customers took 
advantage of Duke Energy’s $62 million solar rebate 
program in North Carolina. A similar, and just as 
popular, program is wrapping up in South Carolina.

The company will also be offering solar leasing to 
North Carolina customers through a subsidiary that 
will build, own and operate on-site solar facilities for 
customers. The program will provide customers another 
option to access renewable energy without paying a 
large upfront investment. 

For large customers, the company’s new Green Source 
Advantage program will allow customers to secure 
renewable power to meet sustainability and renewable 
energy goals. This “green tariff” provides customers the 
flexibility to negotiate directly with solar developers to 
add more renewable energy to the grid, with no cost to 
other customer classes.

The company’s unregulated unit, Duke Energy 
Renewables, expanded its operating solar portfolio 
to another state, with the 24.9-MW Shoreham Solar 
Commons Project near Brookhaven, New York. The 
project, placed into service in July, is about 60 miles 
east of Manhattan. Long Island Power Authority is 
purchasing the power produced from the project from 
Duke Energy Renewables.

The company continues to be on track for its 
sustainability goal of owning or purchasing 8,000 MW 
of wind, solar and biomass capacity by 2020. At 
the end of 2018, the company’s overall total was 
7,100  MW.

GROWTH| Charging an electric vehicle: Duke Energy is helping to install hundreds of charging stations.

Is Electricity a Better 
Fuel Choice?

Electricity fuels so much of our lives, 
it’s difficult to imagine it powering 
even more.

But that’s not how Duke Energy sees it. 
The company is now discovering new 
ways electricity can be the fuel of choice 
over other options – promoting efficiency 
and lower emissions to the environment.

Electric Vehicles – Electric vehicles 
(EVs) save consumers money through 
reduced fuel and maintenance 
expense. And, they contribute to 
cleaner air through lower emissions. 
Using electricity instead of gasoline 
as a fuel source drops the emissions 
from an EV by half versus a gas-
powered automobile.  

There are about 1 million EVs in the 
United States today. But that number 
is expected to grow to about 5 million 
by 2025. Duke Energy has around 
160 electric vehicles in its fleet, and 
the company has committed that 
5 percent of new vehicle purchases will 
be electric.  

Duke Energy is helping build the public 
EV charging station infrastructure 
needed to support EVs. Two years 
ago, Duke Energy provided grants to 
towns and cities in North Carolina to 
locate 200 public EV charging stations 
in the state. Most of these stations 
have now been installed. By 2022, the 
company will have installed more than 
500 charging stations in Florida.

Standby Refrigeration – So much of 
the nation’s food supply is transported 
by diesel trucks and refrigerated 
trailers. But many trailers use diesel-
driven refrigeration units at distribution 
warehouses as they wait to be 
dispatched. Duke Energy has worked 
with two companies in North Carolina 
to install plug-in outlets – allowing the 
refrigerated trailers to use electricity 
instead of diesel fuel.

The North Carolina projects – at Golden 
States Foods in Garner and Merchants 
Distributors in Hickory – are plugging 
in for lower operating costs, a quieter 
workplace and reduced emissions.

ELECTRIC VEHICLES

There are about 1 million 
EVs in the United States 
today. But that number is 
expected to grow to about 
5 million by 2025. 

2018 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   28

GROWTHForklifts – Noise and emissions can be drastically 
cut as adoption of electric forklifts increases in 
warehouses across the nation. Like heavy-duty EVs, 
they are more expensive than traditional diesel-fuel 
vehicles, but reduced operating costs allow 
companies to recoup their investment in two years.

Since electric forklifts have 90 percent fewer parts 
than internal combustion vehicles, repair costs are 
much lower. Plus, they provide a health benefit to 
warehouse employees. The electric forklifts have no 
airborne emissions and are quieter to work around.

Growing Sustainably on Five 
Major Fronts 

Duke Energy continues to build a sustainable and 
smarter energy future:

 ■ Modernizing the energy grid. Duke Energy is 

investing to create a smarter energy grid that will 
give customers more control over their energy 
usage, boost customer convenience, increase 
service reliability, accommodate additional 
renewable energy and bolster energy system 
security – both physical and cyber. (See related 
article on page 19, “Grid Improvements Help 
Keep the Power On.”) 

 ■ Generating cleaner energy. Duke Energy 

continues to generate cleaner energy by investing 
in natural gas-fired power plants, solar and wind 
energy, and other renewable sources.

 ■ Expanding natural gas infrastructure. Natural 
gas will play a major role in Duke Energy’s 
cleaner energy future. The company is investing 
in natural gas-fired power plants, interstate 
natural gas pipelines, and the retrofitting of 
coal-fired power plants to also burn natural gas.

 ■ Transforming the customer experience. Duke Energy 

is working hard to further improve the customer 
experience. New technology is shortening and 
sometimes eliminating power outages. Smart meters 
are giving customers new ways to manage and 
reduce electricity usage, saving them money. Electric 
vehicle charging stations are giving customers new 
transportation fuel options.

 ■ Engaging stakeholders. Fortune magazine named 
Duke Energy to its 2019 “World’s Most Admired 
Companies” list – an indication that Duke Energy’s 
many diverse stakeholders recognize and value 
the company’s significant progress on its future-
focused journey. The company continues to 
work collaboratively with regulators, legislators, 
environmentalists, consumer advocates and 
many others on its multiple sustainability and 
modernization initiatives.

Economic Development: Jobs and 
Major Investment

Duke Energy’s economic development team in 2018 
helped bring nearly 14,000 new jobs and $5.3 billion 
in private-sector investment – through 94 projects – to 
the six states served by the company’s electric utilities.

Site Selection magazine named Duke Energy to its 
“Top Utilities in Economic Development” list for the 
14th consecutive year.

Duke Energy’s economic development specialists 
work to attract new industry to North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. 
The team also encourages existing companies in those 
states to expand at home, rather than look elsewhere.

In 2018, the team evaluated 26 properties for 
potential business and industrial development through 
Duke Energy’s Site Readiness Program. The program 
identifies potential business and industrial sites, then

The team also completed a study of potential industrial 
development sites along a proposed natural gas pipeline 
in eastern North Carolina, and deployed a new drone 
program to assist in site evaluations in all six states.

The Duke Energy Foundation also provided more than 
$1 million to local economic development agencies 
and initiatives to fund job creation and business 
development projects.

“Economic development is a team sport, and we are 
a key position player – working with many local and 
regional partners in different capacities to achieve 
success,” says Stu Heishman, Duke Energy’s vice 
president of economic development. “We’re strongly 
committed to bringing capital investment and jobs to 
the communities we serve.”

Three members of Duke Energy’s economic 
development team received national recognition in 
2018 from site selection professional organizations: 
Consultant Connect named Margaret O’Riley and 
Erin Schneider to its “North America’s Top 50 
Economic Developers” list; DCI named Danielle Ruiz to 
its “40 Under 40” list of 40 rising stars under age 40 
in the economic development field.

A Strong Civic Voice 

Having constructive dialogue with lawmakers and 
regulators is vital to a highly regulated business such 
as Duke Energy. As one of the largest and most 
diverse power holding companies in the United States, 
Duke Energy is well-positioned to provide a balanced 
view on issues that impact the company, industry 
and communities.  

The company advocates for practical public policies 
in Washington, D.C., and state capitals throughout its 
service territory. And, the company encourages civic 
participation at all levels – from voting in local elections 
to engaging with federal regulators.

Duke Energy has many tools to ensure it meets 
its mission to create business value through better 
public policy. One such tool is DukePAC, a voluntary, 
nonpartisan political action committee that leverages 
the collective financial contributions of eligible 
employees to support political organizations and 
candidates seeking elected office at the federal 
and state levels. In 2018, DukePAC contributions 
were $1,518,430.

Duke Energy’s total reportable federal lobbying 
expenses in 2018 were $5,345,592. That amount 
includes $1,188,921 in trade association dues 
(includes dues in excess of $50,000) to support 
policy research and advocacy. The company also 
contributed approximately $1,623,700 to Section 
527 organizations created to support the nomination, 
election, appointment or defeat of a candidate.

Duke Energy’s Political Expenditures 
Policy requires compliance with 
laws and regulations governing 
political contributions, government 
interaction and lobbying activities. It 
also requires a semiannual update 
on political expenditures to the 
Corporate Governance Committee of 
the Duke Energy Board of Directors. 
The company is legally prohibited 
from making direct contributions to 
candidates for U.S. federal offices and 
certain state offices.

Natural Gas Plays Key Role in 
Cleaner Energy Future 

Natural gas is playing a key role as 
Duke Energy pivots toward a cleaner, 
lower-carbon energy future, and away 
from coal-fired electricity generation.

In 2018, the company put into service 
two new natural gas-fired power 
plants that replaced older coal plants: 
the W.S. Lee Station in Anderson 
County, South Carolina, and the Citrus 
Combined Cycle Station in Citrus 
County, Florida.

In 2019, Duke Energy will bring online 
a third new natural gas power plant that 
also will replace coal units: the Asheville 
combined-cycle natural gas plant project 
in Buncombe County, North Carolina. 

Meanwhile, the company has retrofitted 
two coal units at its Rogers Energy 
Complex near Cliffside, North Carolina, 
enabling it to reduce emissions by 
burning a combination of natural gas 
and coal – rather than coal only – to 
produce electricity. Similar retrofitting 
projects are underway at two other 
Duke Energy coal plants in North 
Carolina: Belews Creek Steam Station 
in Stokes County, and Marshall Steam 
Station in Catawba County.

In addition, the company is expanding 
its Lincoln Combustion Turbine Station, 
a natural gas power plant near Denver, 
North Carolina, adding a new generation 
unit that will significantly increase the 
plant’s electricity output, particularly 
during high-demand periods. When fully 
operational in 2024, the new unit will 
be about 34 percent more efficient than 
the site’s 16 existing units. 

On another front, legal and regulatory 
work related to the proposed Atlantic 
Coast Pipeline – partly owned by 
Duke Energy – continues. The 
approximately 600-mile underground 
natural gas pipeline will start in 
West Virginia and traverse Virginia and 
eastern North Carolina. 

LOWER CARBON

Natural gas is playing a 
key role as Duke Energy 
pivots toward a cleaner, 
lower-carbon energy 
future, and away from 
coal-fired electricity

2018 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   32

GROWTHThe pipeline’s natural gas will be used in Virginia and 
North Carolina to fuel power plants and industrial 
facilities; heat homes and businesses; support local 
economic development; and ensure that natural gas 
utilities have enough natural gas to meet growing 
customer demand. 

Delivering Results for Customers 
and Shareholders 

In 2018, Duke Energy achieved adjusted diluted 
earnings per share of $4.72. Through investments 
in the energy grid, cleaner generation and natural 
gas infrastructure, as well as a continued focus on 
managing costs across the business and using digital 
capabilities, the company delivered on its financial 
commitments to shareholders. 

2018 was a year marked by execution. The company’s 
electric and gas businesses saw strong growth, 
underpinned by a robust capital plan and operational 
excellence. And, Duke Energy displayed financial 
flexibility as the company responded to delays with the 
Atlantic Coast Pipeline and significant costs associated 
with storms throughout the year. This dexterity 
enabled the company to extend its earnings per share 
objective of 4 to 6 percent through 2023, based off 
the midpoint of the 2019 guidance range of $4.80 to 
$5.20 per share. 

Duke Energy remains committed to offering an attractive 
long-term investment to its shareholders. 2019 marks 
the company’s 93rd consecutive year paying a dividend 
to its investors, and Duke Energy grew that dividend by 
approximately 4.2 percent in 2018.

Duke Energy’s total shareholder return – measured 
as the change in stock price plus the reinvestment of 
dividends – for 2018 was 7.4 percent, compared to 
3.5 percent for the Philadelphia Utility Index (20 U.S. 
utilities) and -4.4 percent for the S&P 500 during the 
same period. Duke Energy gained traction in the market 
during 2018, demonstrating investors’ confidence in the 
long-term vision for the company, and the utility sector 
performed well as a result of macro uncertainties in 
the market.  

The company also completed its inaugural issuance 
of $1 billion in green bonds for the Duke Energy 
Carolinas utility during 2018. This was followed up 
with an issuance of $600 million in green bonds for the 
Duke Energy Progress utility in early 2019. The funds 
will finance eligible green energy projects – including 
zero-carbon solar and energy storage – in the Carolinas.

Looking ahead, Duke Energy will continue to create 
value for customers and shareholders. With solid 
investment opportunities and a strong focus on the 
dividend, the company is well-positioned to continue 
delivering on its financial commitments in 2019 
and beyond.

OPERATIONSCONSTANT 
MONITORING

Employees monitor more 
than 90 wind, solar and 
battery sites all day and 
all night. 

| Duke Energy’s Renewable Control Center monitors wind and solar facilities nationwide.

Control Center Helps Grow 
Renewable Energy 

Duke Energy Renewables, the company’s 
unregulated renewables business unit, 
not only produces wind, solar and 
battery storage power, it also keeps an 
eye on it, too.

Its Renewable Control Center (RCC) 
in Charlotte, North Carolina, uses 
technology and data to monitor and 
control energy across the United States.

A total of 30 employees monitor wind, 
solar and battery storage facilities all 
day and all night, from coast to coast, 
and direct 5,000 megawatts of energy 
to light cities and towns from North 
Carolina to California.

Some of that energy comes from power 
plants and facilities owned by other 
companies. That includes the nation’s 
first offshore wind farm 3 miles off 
the coast of Rhode Island. Overall, 
the center oversees enough power to 
provide electricity to 1 million homes.

The center started in 2009 with a 
manager and one operator per shift. Ten 
years later, employees monitor more than 
90 wind, solar and battery sites. For 
smaller companies, hiring Duke Energy 
Renewables allows them to afford more 
renewable energy without investing in a 
high-tech facility of their own.

The RCC uses weather data from 
Duke Energy meteorologists to predict 
how much renewable energy can be 
produced each hour and potentially 
in the days ahead. The more accurate 
their predictions are, the more valuable 
the forecast is for energy buyers. Here 
are some of the ways the center uses 
technology to increase renewable energy 
production and keep employees safe. 

 ■ It starts, stops and resets wind 
turbines and solar inverters to 
maximize availability and keep 
technicians safe. The center also 
adjusts solar panels to reduce damage 
during high winds and severe weather. 
In addition to monitoring individual 
plant components, operators look at 
the plant’s performance and output 
to make sure it is producing as much 
power as possible.  

 ■ The technology alerts operators to 
equipment malfunctions, which in 
some cases can be repaired remotely 
in minutes. When repairs require 
in-person assistance, employees 
in Charlotte will dispatch the 
nearest technician.

 ■ In addition to the six monitors at 
their desks, employees use eight 
television-size screens mounted on 
the wall to watch more systems – 
including weather, site cameras and 
substation components.

Striving for a Safer Workplace

Duke Energy is committed to the 
health and safety of its workforce and 
communities. Putting safety first not only 
enhances quality of life but contributes to 
the company’s business success. 

In 2018, our employees delivered 
strong safety results, consistent with 
our industry-leading performance from 
previous years. However, we fell short 
of our aggressive target for our total 
incident case rate. 

To help drive improvement, the 
company focused on injury prevention 
through two campaigns, including a 
summer program aimed at reducing 
heat-related illness and insect bites. 
The second campaign focused on 
reducing line-of-fire injuries caused by 
sharp, moving and low-hanging objects 
striking workers.

In addition to delivering results 
in business-as-usual situations, 
Duke Energy employees exceeded 
expectations under adverse weather 
conditions. The company safely and 
efficiently restored power to millions 
of customers after two catastrophic 
hurricanes impacted our territory 
during 2018.

Despite an improving safety trend, there 
is still work to be done. Duke Energy 
experienced three work-related fatalities 
and one life-altering injury in 2018. 
Reducing the number of serious injuries 
will be a focus for Duke Energy in 2019 
as the company strives to be an injury- 
and illness-free workplace.  

Commitment to a 
Lower‑Carbon Future 

Duke Energy continues to build an energy 
future that is cleaner, smarter and more 
resilient. Duke Energy recognizes the 
long-term challenge that climate change 
presents, and that reducing carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions is a benchmark 
in addressing this global challenge.

The company is at the forefront of the 
transformation underway in the industry. 
It is expanding renewable generation, 
transitioning our generation fleet from 
coal to natural gas and modernizing the 
grid to support new technologies. It has 
reduced its CO2 emissions by 31 percent 
compared to 2005 levels, outpacing 
the industry average of 28 percent, and 
plans to reach a 40 percent reduction 
by 2030.

For nearly a century, unmanned aerial 
vehicles – or drones – were primarily 
tools for the military. But in the last 
decade, various industries have 
embraced this emerging technology.

The energy industry is no exception. 
Duke Energy started using drones in 
2015 to inspect wind and solar sites. 
The uses keep growing: In February 
2018, drone operators engineered a way 
to help string power lines in Puerto Rico 
following Hurricane Maria.

The company now has close to 
100 qualified drone pilots, and operates 
around 60 drones. Employees in various 
departments are now certified pilots 
supporting every major line of business.

Drones have many uses at the company:

 ■ Flying a drone with an infrared 

camera over a solar site eliminates 
time-consuming electrical testing 
and helps technicians identify faulty 
equipment within seconds of takeoff.

The investments Duke Energy has 
made to retire less efficient coal- and 
oil-fired power plants, build highly 
efficient natural gas generation, expand 
its portfolio of renewables, and support 
its zero-CO2 emissions hydropower 
and nuclear plants have diversified the 
company’s system and significantly 
reduced CO2 emissions. 

Duke Energy’s dedication to the facts, 
the science and a balanced generation 
portfolio helped it to achieve its 2018 
emissions milestone, and positions the 
company for further reductions. Along 
with significant coal unit retirements 
over recent years, the company has 
saved over a million homes-worth of 
energy through efficiency programs, 
dedicated $11 billion to cleaner energy 
capacity, and maintained its existing 
nuclear generation, among other 
achievements detailed in this report. 

Reducing CO2 emissions is only part 
of Duke Energy’s commitment to a 
cleaner energy future. Duke Energy has 
a responsibility to take a comprehensive 
approach to reducing its environmental 
footprint, and has made significant 
progress across a number of areas, 
including reducing sulfur dioxide 
emissions by 96 percent from 2005 
levels, to using municipal reclaimed 
water in energy generation in Florida.

OPERATIONS ■ Helicopters remain the primary tool 
for damage assessment after major 
storms because they can travel 
faster and farther than drones, but 
operators can use drones to perform 
detailed inspections, especially in 
densely populated areas where a 
helicopter cannot go safely.

Duke Energy first used drones for 
storm damage assessment following 
Hurricane Matthew in 2016 when 
crews were unable to drive through the 
Carolinas’ flooded roads. With drones, 
the team could inspect power lines and 
vegetation quicker – knocking days off 
the company’s assessment. 

Recently in Ohio, a team completed a 
drone inspection of a transmission tower 
and power lines in days along the Ohio 
River. These inspections would have 
taken weeks if lineworkers had to climb 
the towers.

Across the energy industry, drones are 
making it easier and safer to inspect 
many tall structures. Instead of climbing 
a power pole (some are more than 
300 feet tall), a drone can fly to the 
top and take pictures from multiple 
angles. Drones are also able to zoom in 
on equipment, which makes it easier to 
see small defects like cracks on a wind 
turbine or porcelain insulator.

Staying Ahead of the Game: 
Securing the Energy Grid 

The world is becoming more digital 
every day – and with more technology 
comes more opportunities for 
cybersecurity threats.    

As the largest operator of the energy grid, 
protecting our infrastructure, operations 
and customer information is a top priority 
for Duke Energy. The company is making 
the electric grid more secure, so that it 
can withstand and protect against the 
growing threats of cyber and physical 
attacks. With multiple layers of security, 
company experts can quickly identify 
threats and protect essential systems 
and equipment. 

Duke Energy focuses its cybersecurity 
efforts in many areas. The company 
educates employees and increases 
awareness of threats – from routine test 
phishing emails and annual trainings 
to seminars and video resources. 
Duke Energy also maintains a round-
the-clock incident response team of 
highly skilled cybersecurity professionals 
solely devoted to this issue, who identify 
and mitigate threats.

The company has implemented 
defenses to safeguard our systems – and 
continues to implement new safeguards 
as threats and technology evolve. To 
prepare for an incident, the company 
conducts drills to test emergency 
response plans and ensure employees 
are prepared in case an event occurs.

As with many industries, information 
sharing is also essential – that’s 
why Duke Energy works with many 
federal and regional agencies, 
industry organizations and emergency 
management to share lessons learned.

OPERATIONSHydro Team Manages Lakes 
During Wet Year

For more than 100 years, Duke Energy 
has been harnessing rivers to generate 
clean renewable energy. Its hydropower 
plants are key to the company’s long-
term mission to provide sustainable 
energy solutions that customers value. 

2018 was an especially challenging 
year for Duke Energy’s hydro operations 
team, with hurricanes Florence and 
Michael, followed by winter storm 
Diego and back-to-back rain storms in 
December. It contributed to one of the 
wettest years in almost 50 years.

For Duke Energy’s hydro system, 
the 2018 yearly total rainfall was 
56.55 inches, 10.29 inches above the 
47-year long-term average. December 
was the wettest December since 1971, 
with 8.40 inches of rain across the 
entire hydro system. 

Because the safety of downstream 
residents is the company’s highest 
priority, the hydro team works closely 
with the company’s meteorologists and 
hydrologists to anticipate and prepare 
for severe weather that could affect 
lake levels. 

The company’s 32 hydro stations and 
reservoirs in the Carolinas are operated 
from the Regulated Renewables 
Operations Center in Charlotte, which 
is staffed around the clock to manage 
reservoirs along the Catawba-Wateree, 
Yadkin-Pee Dee, Keowee-Toxaway, 
Broad and Nantahala rivers.  

RELIABLE POWER 

Safe, reliable power is a high priority for Duke Energy and our 7.7 million 
customers. In 2018, reliability remained high, despite hurricanes Florence and 
Michael, and winter storm Diego. Each year the company sets power delivery and 
generation fleet performance targets.

OPERATIONSCOMMUNITY INPUT

Duke Energy is working proactively with local communities on more than 
750 transmission projects.

The largest lakes on the Catawba River system – 
Lake James, Norman and Wylie – can store substantial 
amounts of precipitation and runoff, which significantly 
reduces downstream impacts to property and public 
safety. With a forecast of 8 to 10 inches of rainfall in 
the river basin from Hurricane Florence, the hydro team 
aggressively moved water in advance of the storm to 
create additional storage capacity, lowering the three 
lakes as much as 4 to 5 feet over six days. 

During high water and flooding conditions, Duke Energy 
works closely with local emergency management 
officials to notify and protect the public. The company 
also maintains a lake website with current lake level 
information and high-water alerts, as well as a toll-free 
phone line with current lake levels, special information 
and advisories.

Although 2018 was a challenging year for managing 
reservoirs, the hydro operations team succeeded 
at keeping reservoirs from reaching critical levels 
that could have resulted in evacuations or power 
disconnects in low-lying areas.

To provide customers more information, Duke Energy 
is communicating through multiple channels including 
letters, postcards, project-specific documents, face-to-
face meetings with key stakeholders, project-specific 
websites, public meetings, interactive maps and 
dedicated telephone project hotlines. The company 
takes customer preferences regarding the route and 
aesthetics into account to the extent practical while 
designing the project.

In Polk County, Florida, Duke Energy is rebuilding a 
19.9-mile, 230-kilovolt transmission line. In advance 
of construction, company representatives worked 
with local communities to minimize the impacts from 
construction such as traffic lane closures, noise and 
other potential inconveniences to property owners.

This type of collaboration is playing out continuously 
throughout the Duke Energy service territory and 
resulting in better education about projects for the public, 
improved understanding by the company of community 
interests, and fewer impacts to property, natural and 
cultural resources, communities and commerce. 

Engaging the Community on 
Transmission Projects 

Duke Energy is working proactively with local 
communities on more than 750 transmission projects. 
Projects range from new transmission line installations 
and rebuilding existing lines, to new substations, 
substation expansions, safety and security equipment, 
interconnection projects and pole replacements.

Customers have a desire to know what’s happening 
near their homes and in their communities. They 
want more specific and detailed information regarding 
those projects.

Strong Progress To Permanently Close 
Ash Basins

As Duke Energy’s work to close 59 ash basins at 
21 plants continues to accelerate, expert teams focused 
on basin closure logged more than 7 million hours in 
2018, demonstrating the company’s commitment to 
safely managing coal ash.

By the end of 2018, the company had ceased sending 
ash to nearly all basins, well in advance of state and 
federal requirements. At most operating coal plants, 
new systems and equipment replaced ash basins, 
positioning Duke Energy to begin the closure process.

2018 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   41

OPERATIONSAbout 22 million tons of ash have 
been excavated since basin closure 
began, including more than 5 million 
tons moved in 2018. Ash has been 
excavated from seven basins in North 
Carolina, South Carolina and Indiana, 
with seven others in North Carolina 
and Kentucky expected to be complete 
in 2019, including the Dan River site.

Duke Energy continues to look for 
innovative ways to recycle and reuse 
coal ash. Overall, the company 
successfully recycled nearly 80 percent 
of the coal ash produced at its 
operating power plants in 2018.

Hurricane Florence brought historic 
flooding to the Sutton and H.F. 
Lee facilities, displacing a small 
amount of ash and cenospheres, 
another combustion byproduct. N.C. 
Department of Environmental Quality 
testing validated that the public and 
water quality remained protected 
throughout the storm. The company’s 
experts and spokespeople responded 
quickly to address and correct 
misleading media reports during 
the hurricane.

In April 2019, North Carolina officials 
ordered the company to excavate nine 
basins where closure decisions had 
not yet been made. We believe the 
decision imposes a financial burden on 
our customers and the economy of the 
Carolinas through the most expensive 
and disruptive closure option possible, 
despite that these basins are rated 
“low risk” by the state and capping 
would be fully protective of people and 
the environment. 

The company is appealing the order as 
we continue to advocate for common 
sense plans to close all of our basins 
in ways that benefit customers 
and communities.

OPERATIONSNUCLEAR CORNERSTONE

With the company looking to reduce 2005 greenhouse gas levels by 40 percent 
by 2030, nuclear generation is the cornerstone for achieving this target.

Nuclear: Carbon‑Free Powerhouse

Generating one-third of the company’s electricity, 
nuclear power is Duke Energy’s largest source of 
carbon-free energy.

All the company’s 11 nuclear generating units in the 
Carolinas have been operating for longer than 30 years. 
Yet, in many ways, the units are operating better 
than ever.

The company’s fleet achieved a combined capacity 
factor of 93 percent in 2018, which is above the 
industry average. That means the units were operating 
practically all the time. It was the 20th consecutive 
year the fleet capacity factor exceeded 90 percent.

Many units of the company’s plants produced record 
generation during 2018 – in either specific months or 
quarters. That power was needed during the hottest 
and coldest days of the year – since 2018 had both 
extreme cold and heat in the Carolinas.

Continuous operation marks of more than 500 days in 
a row were hit by several units in 2018. For the nuclear 
industry, that was unheard of 20 years ago.

With the company looking to reduce 2005 greenhouse 
gas levels by 40 percent by 2030, nuclear generation is 
the cornerstone for achieving this target.

Piedmont Innovates with Vertical 
Main Project

Although our natural gas business serves 1.6 million 
residential customers across its service territories, 
natural gas service in residential buildings such as 
apartments or condominiums is uncommon.

When the developer of City Lights in Nashville, 
Tennessee, approached Piedmont Natural Gas to bring 
natural gas service to its residents in a seven-story 
condominium complex, the company stepped up to 
the challenge. 

“The growth in Nashville has been phenomenal 
over the past five years,” said Eddie Davidson, state 
government affairs director for Piedmont Natural Gas. 
“New buildings are being built taller and taller, requiring 
inventive natural gas solutions.”

While Piedmont is accustomed to burying pipelines 
– and running underground service lines to homes – 
delivering service vertically to homes dozens of feet off 
the ground requires a unique approach. 

The Piedmont team engineered a “vertical main,” a 
natural gas line that runs upward through the entire 
building to a series of meter rooms, one on each 
floor. From these meter rooms, service lines run to 
the building’s 71 individual residences, as well as 
to an amenities area and restaurant space on the 
development’s first floor.

As with every project Piedmont undertakes, safety is 
the No. 1 priority. To ensure proper ventilation in the 
building, the team created a mechanical ventilation 
system from the first floor of the building to the roof 
where a fan runs continuously to draw air up and out of 
the building.

Because of its work on the City Lights project, 
Piedmont has the specifications in place to safely bring 
this innovative approach to other buildings, expanding 
the market of residential customers for the future.

2018 electricity generated and 
generation capacity

Duke Energy has a diverse, increasingly clean 
generation portfolio. Almost 38 percent of the 
electricity we generated in 2018 was from 
carbon-free (nearly zero carbon emissions) 
sources, including nuclear, wind, hydro and 
solar. Over 32 percent was from lower-carbon 
natural gas, which emits about half as much 
carbon dioxide as coal when used for electric 
generation. About 30 percent was from 
higher-carbon coal and oil. Taken together, 
owned and purchased renewables are 
equivalent to over 9 percent of our generation. 
Duke Energy Renewables sells the electricity 
and/or Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) 
it generates to its customers.

Water withdrawn and consumed 
for electric generation

Water withdrawn is the total volume removed 
from a water source, such as a lake or a river. 
Because of the once-through cooling systems 
on many of our coal-fired and nuclear plants, 
over 98 percent of this water is returned to 
the source and available for other uses. Water 
consumed is the amount of water removed for 
use and not returned to the source. 

Emissions from electric generation

Many factors influence emissions levels and 
intensities, including generation diversity and 
efficiency, demand for electricity, weather, 
fuel availability and prices, and emissions 
controls deployed. Since 2005, our carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased by 
31 percent, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions 
decreased by 96 percent and nitrogen oxides 
(NOX) emissions decreased by 74 percent. 
These decreases are primarily due to addition 
of pollution control equipment, decreased coal 
generation, increased natural gas generation 
and replacement of higher-emitting plants. 

Methane emissions from  
pipeline operations

Methane (CH4) is the primary component of 
natural gas, and is a greenhouse gas. We 
work to minimize methane emissions, but 
some is released during pipeline operations 
and maintenance. Duke Energy is a founding 
partner of the U.S. EPA’s Natural Gas Star 
Methane Challenge program, which is aimed 
at cost-effective technologies and practices 
that improve operational efficiency and 
reduce methane emissions.

Sulfur hexafluoride emissions

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an insulating gas 
used in high-voltage electric transmission 
and distribution switchgear equipment, and 
is a greenhouse gas. We work to minimize 
SF6 emissions, but some is released during 
transmission and distribution operations 
and maintenance.

Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)

Duke Energy’s TRI releases for 2017 were 
down nearly 86 percent from 2007, primarily 
due to the significant investments we’ve 
made in environmental controls for our power 
plants, and decreased coal generation. (Data 
for 2018 will be available in August 2019.)

Waste

We came in just below our goal to recycle 
80 percent of our solid waste, and are working 
on strategies to meet this goal in the future. 
(This goal excludes Duke Energy Renewables, 
which has a relatively small waste stream.)    

Reportable oil spills

Oil spills include releases of lubricating 
oil from generating stations, leaks from 
transformers, or damage caused by weather 
or by third parties (typically because of 
auto accidents). 

Environmental regulatory citations

Fines/penalties were relatively large in 
2015 because of the May 2015 coal ash 
enforcement agreement; and in 2016 because 
of a 2014 oil spill at the Beckjord Station 
in Ohio, and a 2014 coal ash spill. See 
the “Legal Cases Resolved” article in the 
2015 Sustainability Report.

EMPLOYEES| Duke Energy employs more than 2,000 military veterans, including engineers and powerline technicians.

A Strong Commitment to Those Who 
Serve in the Military

Employees who work as a team and can solve 
problems describes the men and women who serve in 
the military. It’s the main reason that Duke Energy is 
striving to attract these people to our workforce. 

“Duke Energy highly values employees who are military 
veterans, National Guard members and military 
reservists,” says Lynn Good, company chairman, 
president and CEO. “We’re extremely proud to support 
the men and women who serve our country, protect our 
freedom and make our company great.  

“They possess training, technical skills and leadership 
qualities that transfer to business. They excel at working 
in diverse teams and adapting to new environments 
and assignments. And, they have a determination 
to see a job through to the end, no matter what 
the circumstance.” 

Duke Energy received the 2018 Secretary of Defense 
Employer Support Freedom Award – the highest honor 
given by the U.S. Department of Defense to companies 
that provide outstanding support to employees who serve 
in the National Guard and Reserve. 

The company was one of only 15 companies to receive 
the award out of more than 2,300 companies nominated. 

Highlights of Duke Energy’s commitment to those who 
serve in the military:

 ■ Duke Energy employs more than 2,000 military 
veterans – from engineers who operate the 
company’s nuclear power plants to lineworkers who 
connect customers to the electric grid.

 ■ Duke Energy provides 120 hours (three weeks) of 
full pay for annual military leave to employees who 
serve in the National Guard and Reserve. That puts 
Duke Energy near the top of companies supporting 
those who serve their country.

 ■ “Together We Stand” – a 450-member, veteran-

focused Duke Energy employee resource group – 
mentors newly hired veterans at the company.

 ■ Duke Energy actively participates in Enable America, 
a nonprofit group (funded in part by the Duke Energy 
Foundation) that provides training and job placement 
assistance to disabled veterans and transitioning 
service members.

EMPLOYEES| Duke Energy’s commitment to diversity and inclusion helps the company attract top talent.

Deepening and Diversifying the 
Talent Pipeline

Duke Energy’s communities, customers and workforce 
are more diverse today than ever. Diverse employees and 
leadership are critical assets as the company transforms 
to better serve customers and communities. 

Duke Energy believes that a commitment to diversity 
and inclusion helps foster innovation and enables us to 
attract and retain world-class talent. 

With that in mind, the company elevated diversity and 
inclusion to the C-suite and named Joni Davis as chief 
diversity and inclusion officer. In that role, Davis is 
focused on building a diverse and inclusive organization 
that delivers the right products and services to its 
customers, grows the business and enables people to 
reach their full potential. 

One of the many ways the company aims to diversify its 
talent pipeline is through deepening relationships with 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In 
2018, Duke Energy became the first energy company 
to sign up for the HBCU Partnership Challenge created 
by the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus.

Congresswoman Alma S. Adams (D-NC) and 
Congressman Bradley Byrne (R-AL), co-chairs of 
the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, launched the HBCU 
Partnership Challenge to promote greater engagement 
and support from private companies with HBCUs. 

Duke Energy’s wide-ranging support of HBCUs 
underscores the company’s commitment to attract 
and retain the diverse talent the business needs to 
successfully serve its customers. For example:  

 ■ Through the Duke Energy Foundation, the company 
has provided more than $1.5 million to nine HBCUs 
to support scholarships, academic programs and 
other initiatives, with a focus on programs aligned 
with the energy industry’s future workforce needs. 
For instance, the company invested in a five-week 
bridge program at North Carolina A&T State University 
to attract and retain high-achieving students in 
engineering and computer science disciplines.  

 ■ In 2018, Duke Energy established the position of 

HBCU and Diversity Recruiter, which is solely focused 
on deepening the talent pipeline from HBCUs and 
other diverse organizations and communities.  

 ■ The company participates in career fairs and 

information sessions and conducts on-campus 
interviews at several HBCUs across our service 
footprint, including North Carolina A&T State 
University, Florida A&M University, Johnson C. Smith 
University, Wilberforce University and South Carolina 
State University. 

Managing Human Assets with the 
Future in Mind

To grow as a company, Duke Energy is looking for 
better ways to manage its assets, including the ones 
most critical to the company’s success: employees. 
Through both formal training and knowledge transfer, 
the company continues to invest in and prepare workers 
to meet industry challenges.  

2018 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   50

EMPLOYEESFOCUSING ON EMPLOYEES

Through both formal training and knowledge transfer, the company continues to 
invest in and prepare workers to meet industry challenges.

The Duke Energy Leadership Academy offers a 
variety of learning and development opportunities 
companywide. The core curriculum offers independent 
studies and facilitated programs to address the needs 
of each leadership level. Elective resources are also 
available to further support specific learning and 
development needs. 

Duke Energy’s nuclear fleet is using 3-D printing to train 
employees. In addition to seeing pictures of breakers 
and valves, students can touch and study 3-D printed 
models of the metal components they’ll encounter.  

Since the models are plastic, they are easy to handle and 
can be customized to meet the needs of student training. 
And, the printed models mean real, more expensive 
components are not needed simply for training.

Nuclear employees are also transferring knowledge 
in other ways. The company’s North American Young 
Generation in Nuclear (NAYGN) members created a 
fleetwide program to formally recognize experienced 
employees who mentor newer teammates.

The program, which has been replicated at nuclear 
plants nationwide, encourages more experienced 
employees to help their less-seasoned colleagues gain 
the valuable knowledge and experience to ensure the 
nuclear fleet continues operational excellence. Such 
knowledge transfer leads to error-free work, workload 
reduction and a more engaged workforce.

As Duke Energy looks to extend the licenses of its 
nuclear fleet for another 20 years, programs like these 
ensure valuable operating knowledge and experience 
are retained and passed on to the next generation 
of workers. 

And, they serve as a model for the rest of the company 
as Duke Energy evolves to meet the needs and 
expectations of all customers. 

Training the Next Generation 
of Lineworkers

North Carolina’s community colleges are key to creating 
a skilled workforce and thriving business climate. 
That’s why Duke Energy partners with several of these 
institutions as it harnesses new technologies and works 
to innovate and transform the customer experience. 

The Carolinas Energy Workforce Consortium estimates 
the industry will need 1,500 new lineworkers each 
year for the next five to six years in North Carolina. It’s 
important the company collaborates to develop job-
specific training and energy-related curriculums, while 
helping introduce much needed entry-level talent into 
the job market.

Duke Energy relies on the expertise of lineworkers 
to maintain and grow energy infrastructure across 
the state, not to mention to power North Carolina’s 
economy and communities. As the company works to 
build an even smarter energy grid that will improve the 
way Duke Energy serves customers, the need for skilled 
line technicians will be even greater.

To date, Duke Energy has partnered with 10 community 
colleges in North Carolina to develop lineworker training 
programs that blend hands-on learning and classroom 
instruction to train the next generation of employees.

One of those institutions is Cape Fear Community 
College, located in Wilmington, North Carolina. 
With the help of a $200,000 grant from Duke Energy, 
the college launched its Power Line Technician 
Program in June 2018. The program includes a 
10-week course to teach students pole climbing and 
equipment installation as well as commercial driving. 
This program is graduating roughly 40 new students 
every class and has projections to reach 150 to 
200 graduates annually.

EMPLOYEES| Rick Burger – Duke Energy’s Rick Burger was honored for his decades of service to Indiana communities.

COMMITTED TO 
SERVICE

In 2018, Rick Burger 
was honored with a 
James B. Duke Award, 
Duke Energy’s highest 
employee honor for 
service to the company 
and community.

In late 2018, Duke Energy announced 
it is partnering with the South Carolina 
Technical College System to invest 
$1 million in grants to expand training 
opportunities for lineworkers across the 
state. A committee will award grants 
twice a year with a maximum grant for 
any program capped at $200,000. The 
Carolinas Energy Workforce Consortium 
is projecting the need for at least 
500 lineworker hires every year for the 
next five years in South Carolina.  

With Hands, Heart, Rick 
Burger Makes Indiana Better

In 2018, Rick Burger was honored with 
a James B. Duke Award, Duke Energy’s 
highest employee honor for service to 
the company and community.

The award honored Burger’s lifetime 
achievement to the company. In more 
than four decades with Duke Energy, 
he has become a household name in 
west central Indiana. He’s taken the 
company’s commitment to charitable 
giving and volunteerism to a high 
level – helping raise millions of dollars 
for charities.

During the holiday season, you’ll 
find Burger dropping off cookies to 
community leaders as a “thank you.” 
Or, the government and community 
relations manager might be helping raise 
money for a new animal shelter.

Burger’s first job for predecessor 
company Public Service Indiana was as 
an agricultural representative – working 
with farmers on their needs for electricity.

Now, he’s the person local reporters 
contact when they’re chasing an 
energy-related story – doing more than 
100 interviews a year.

When he learned that the police 
department in Brazil, Indiana, needed a 
new station, he helped negotiate the sale 
of an old Duke Energy office to the city.

In 2018, he helped organize an air show 
that featured the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, 
Air Force’s F-22 Raptor and Tora! Tora! 
Tora! The event drew 60,000 people 
and had a major economic impact on 
the community.

When someone asks Burger how he’s 
doing, he hands out a business card 
with a simple message: “Working for the 
people and living the dream.”

2018 DUKE ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   54

NON‑GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
NON‑GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Non-GAAP Measures

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP 
financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. 
These items represent income from continuing operations attributable to 
Duke Energy, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. 
As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, 
which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy’s ongoing 
performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and 
adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides 
them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance 
across periods.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and 
forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, 
employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted diluted EPS is also 
used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable 
GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are GAAP 
Reported Earnings and GAAP Reported EPS, respectively.

Special items included in the periods presented include the following, which 
management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

  Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from strategic 

acquisitions.

  Regulatory and Legislative Impacts in 2018 represents charges related to 
the Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas North Carolina rate 
case orders and the repeal of the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. For 
2017, it represents charges related to the Levy nuclear project in Florida and 
the Mayo Zero Liquid Discharge and Sutton combustion turbine projects in 
North Carolina.

  Impairment Charges in 2018 represents an impairment at Citrus County 
CC, a goodwill impairment at Commercial Renewables and an other-than-
temporary impairment of an investment in Constitution Pipeline Company, 
LLC. For 2017 and 2016, the charges represent goodwill and other-than-
temporary asset impairments at Commercial Renewables.

  Sale of Retired Plant represents the loss associated with selling Beckjord, a 

nonregulated generating facility in Ohio.

  Impacts of the Tax Act represents amounts recognized related to the Tax Act.
  Severance Charges relate to companywide initiatives, excluding merger 

integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and 
workforce optimization.

Adjusted earnings also include the operating results of the International 
Disposal Group, which has been classified as discontinued operations. 
Management believes inclusion of the operating results of the International 
Disposal Group within adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS results in a 
better reflection of Duke Energy’s financial performance during the period.

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other 
companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.
