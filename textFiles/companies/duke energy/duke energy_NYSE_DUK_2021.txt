A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO

Duke Energy is a mission-driven company, and our mission today is nothing 
short of leading the industry’s most ambitious clean energy transition.

Thanks to the accomplishments of our more than 27,000 employees, we 
advanced our clean energy strategy, solidified our leadership, and found new 
ways to deliver value to our stakeholders in pursuit of that mission. 

For the past 15 years, we published a Sustainability Report outlining the 
contributions that improved the lives of our customers, communities, 
employees and society. This year, we’ve renamed and expanded the report 
to align with our company’s focus on environmental stewardship, social 
responsibility and corporate governance, or ESG. 

For us, ESG is not an aspiration. Rather, it’s fundamental to our corporate 
purpose and our business strategy. Our entire company is focused on 
achieving our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, while maintaining 
affordability and reliability for our customers and delivering returns to our 
shareholders. We are collaborating with stakeholders and transforming and 
readying the system to decarbonize our generation fleet. 

We also place great value on social responsibility. We’re creating a 
diverse and inclusive workforce and investing to provide employees new 
opportunities to grow, develop and advance. Equitable solutions also remain 
a top priority as we strengthen our focus on environmental justice and a 
just transition to cleaner energy. And to bolster governance excellence, 
we’ve adopted a management approach to ESG that engages all levels 
of the company to ensure we’re delivering results the right way and 
with transparency.

4   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Our entire company is 
focused on achieving our 
goal of net-zero emissions 
by 2050, while maintaining 
affordability and reliability for 
our customers and delivering 
returns to our shareholders.

2021 Highlights 

This ESG focus will continue to define our success, 
and our achievements in 2021 speak to the incredible 
progress we’ve made: 

 ■ Reduced Scope 1 carbon emissions from electricity 
generation by 44% since 2005 – the equivalent of 
taking more than 13 million vehicles off the road. 
And we recently expanded our net-zero goal to 
include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.

 ■ Continued to lead the largest planned coal exit in the 
country. Since 2010, we retired 7,500 megawatts of 
coal. We’re targeting energy from coal to represent 
less than 5% of our total generation by 2030 and a 
full exit by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals. 

 ■ Surpassed more than 10,000 megawatts of owned, 
operated or purchased renewables and remain on 
track to reach 16,000 megawatts by 2025 and 
24,000 megawatts by 2030.

 ■ Supported comprehensive energy legislation in North 
Carolina that prioritizes affordability and reliability 
and introduces regulatory reforms to align utility 
investments with customer needs and improve 
rate certainty.

 ■ Submitted our first subsequent license renewal 

application – for Oconee Nuclear Station, our largest 
nuclear plant – and intend to file for all 11 units to 
keep our assets operating up to 80 years. 

 ■ Brought 225 megawatts of solar online in Florida 

as part of a combined $2 billion investment to add 
nearly 1,500 megawatts of solar to our Florida 
generation portfolio by the end of 2024. 

 ■ Completed our multiyear Park and Plug pilot 

program, installing over 625 charging stations in 
Florida. We plan to invest $100 million over the next 
three years on additional pilot programs that will help 
decarbonize the transportation sector. 

 ■ Committed more than $44 million from our company 
and our Foundation to address the greatest needs 
of our communities, including $6 million for social 
justice and racial equity efforts and more than 
$3 million for pandemic relief. 

 ■ Supported vulnerable customers, offering flexible 

payment arrangements and establishing a dedicated 
team to partner with nonprofit organizations to 
help customers receive more than $100 million in 
financial support. 

 ■ Improved leadership and workforce diversity, 

expanded training and built awareness around key 
diversity and inclusion priorities. We were one of few 
companies in our industry to disclose data from an 
Employment Information Report (EEO-1) last year. 

 ■ Developed a Sustainable Financing Framework to 
help fund investments in eligible green and social 
projects, while providing greater transparency around 
our investments and priorities. 

 ■ Conducted a review of our political expenditures and 
lobbying policies and practices, adding additional 
oversight and releasing the industry’s first Trade 
Association Climate Review. 

Advancing Our Clean 
Energy Transformation 

We’re taking aggressive action and are working 
alongside regulators, policymakers, investors and 
other stakeholders to make even greater progress in 
combating climate change, ensuring the best outcomes 
for our company and communities. We look forward 
to updating you on our progress at our fall ESG 
Investor Day.

Duke Energy’s purpose is to power the lives of our 
customers and the vitality of our communities, and 
the contents of our 2021 ESG Report show how we’re 
delivering on this purpose.

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CSO

In 2021, change, adaptation and agility continued to be a part of our 
“next normal.” In keeping with that theme, it’s only fitting that after 15 years 
of publishing a Sustainability Report, we’ve retitled our annual reporting 
document to reflect our progress more accurately along the dimensions of 
environmental, social and governance (ESG). 

ESG is essential to who we are. Our ESG strategy is focused on how we 
create value while at the same time mitigate the risks associated with our 
business. We are committed to a future that offers reliable, accessible and 
affordable clean energy for all customers and areas we serve. Achieving 
this vision will require us to transition to low- and zero-emissions energy, to 
invest in our communities, and to develop and prepare a diverse workforce. 
Taken together, these efforts will deliver long-term value for our customers, 
employees, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders.

We undertook an intensive research and stakeholder benchmarking exercise 
in 2021 to ensure we are focused on the ESG issues that provide our 
company with the opportunity to make the biggest impact and where we 
are uniquely positioned to make a positive difference. Keeping stakeholder 
engagement at the forefront of all we do, our ESG priorities center on 
the clean energy transition and fall into four themes, each of which have 
subcomponents and all of which are interconnected:

 ■ Justice, equity and inclusion

 ■ Climate resiliency

 ■ Vibrant economies

 ■ Employee, customers and communities 

We use a data-driven and dynamic process for ESG risk identification and 
monitoring and will continue to solicit feedback from stakeholders as we 
make progress on our clean energy transformation and net-zero goals.

6   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

We are committed to a 
future that offers reliable, 
accessible and affordable 
clean energy for all 
customers and areas 
we serve.

Key highlights in this year’s 
report include:

Our clean energy transition: We have retired 56 coal 
units since 2010 and reduced our carbon emissions 
from electricity generation by 44% from 2005 levels. 
And we are on pace to achieve our goal of at least 
50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 from 
electricity generation and net-zero methane emissions 
from our natural gas business by 2030. In February 
2022, we took additional steps toward action on 
climate change by targeting energy generated by coal to 
represent less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and 
to fully exit coal by 2035, pending regulatory approval, 
as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in 
the industry. We also expanded our 2050 net-zero goals 
to include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.

Environmental justice and the just transition: Our 
long-term success is deeply intertwined with the health 
and well-being of the communities we serve. We 
believe environmental justice is a business imperative, 
fundamental to our operations and a pillar of meaningful 
stakeholder engagement. In 2021, we published the 
principles that guide our work. And, as we navigate the 
largest planned coal retirement in the industry, we are 
meaningfully addressing the impacts to employees and 
communities, building from our past work. Our focus in 
2021 was deep research to determine best practices 
and we are leaning in to better understand what the 
needs are across a diverse set of stakeholders. We want 
to create solutions that work for employees, customers 
and communities. 

Human capital management: We are being intentional 
as we continue to develop an innovative, talented team 
of professionals who also represent the diversity of 
our customers and communities. This is foundational 
to our success. We launched a talent marketplace for 
employees to find short-term development opportunities 
to share their skills and more than 400 gig positions 

have been filled. We had our most diverse recruiting 
year ever with 35% female and 34% people of color as 
new hires. We are actively recruiting from historically 
Black colleges and universities. Internally, we had nearly 
6,000 employees attend 50 sessions of our “Let’s Talk 
About It” series that continues to help us build a more 
inclusive workplace. 

Governance: We have adapted a management 
approach to ESG that engages all levels of the company 
from the Board of Directors to our employees. Our 
newly formed ESG Strategy and Disclosures Committee 
provides additional oversight of ESG strategy, 
disclosure controls and process, and helps to align 
the business units with ESG risks and opportunities. 
And we’ve enhanced our transparency around 
political involvement.

Change is our constant and the challenges and 
opportunities facing the energy sector require all of us 
to come together to take action. We believe business 
accelerates at the speed of trust. Transparently 
addressing issues like climate change and human 
capital management through reporting and disclosure 
is top of mind not just for our company but increasingly 
for policymakers, investors and other stakeholders. 
And we aim to continue to provide our stakeholders 
with insight into our practices so they can chart our 
progress and help hold us accountable. Trust begins 
with transparency. We look forward to working together 
on a brighter and more equitable energy future!

We are taking additional steps toward action on climate change while maintaining our commitment to reliable, 
accessible and affordable energy for customers and communities. As one of America’s largest electric and gas utilities, 
we along with many of our stakeholders share the view that the company can take a leadership role in tackling the 
greenhouse gas emissions associated with our business and value chain. 

This includes: 

 ■ Targeting energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal by 

20351 as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. 

 ■ Expanding our 2050 net-zero goals to now include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.

 ■ In the electric business, our net-zero goal will include greenhouse gas emissions from the power we purchase 
for resale, from the procurement of fossil fuels used for generation and from the electricity purchased for our 
own use.

 ■ For the natural gas business, it means adding a new net-zero by 2050 goal that includes upstream 

methane and carbon emissions related to purchased natural gas and downstream carbon emissions from 
customers’ consumption.

We are currently working to determine the emissions associated with relevant Scope 3 categories. Then we will 
prioritize the categories for which we have adopted goals and identify what actions the company can take over time to 
reduce these emissions.

Already, we have reduced Scope 1 carbon emissions from electricity generation by 44% from 2005 levels, the 
equivalent of removing 13 million vehicles from the road. And are on pace to achieve our goals of at least 50% 
reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 from electricity generation and net-zero methane emissions in the natural 
gas business by 2030. 

Actions in our electricity business include:

 ■ Retired 56 coal units, representing approximately 7,500 MW since 2010.

 ■ Filed integrated resource plans with preferred scenarios that support exiting coal generation by 2035. 

 ■ Submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a subsequent license renewal for Oconee 

Nuclear Station to keep this carbon-free energy source running for an additional 20 years. We plan to pursue similar 
license renewals for each of our nuclear units. 

 ■ Surpassed more than 10,000 MW of owned, operated or purchased renewable energy and remain on track to 

reach 16,000 MW by 2025 and 24,000 MW by 2030.

 ■ Partnered with Siemens and Clemson University on a Department of Energy-supported study to evaluate hydrogen 
integration and utilization at the Duke Energy-owned and operated Clemson University combined heat and power 
plant. It and other opportunities are continuing to be explored to demonstrate hydrogen for energy generation.

 ■ Partnered with TerraPower and the Natrium Reactor team to provide consulting and in-kind services for the 

demonstration of this advanced nuclear reactor with integrated thermal storage. 

 ■ Partnered with Honeywell to test its new flow battery technology, which can store and discharge electricity for up 

to 12 hours, exceeding the duration of lithium-ion batteries, which can only discharge for up to four hours.

1  Subject to regulatory approvals. Contemplates retiring Edwardsport coal gasifiers by 2035 or adding carbon capture utilization and storage to reduce carbon emissions.

11   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Our natural gas business continues to decarbonize to meet its climate goals. With the expanded Scope 3 net-zero goal, 
we have an opportunity to shape the industry through making our own investments, offering customer programs and 
working with suppliers to reduce methane and carbon emissions. Work underway includes:

 ■ Partnered with Accenture and Microsoft on a unique satellite leak detection platform designed to measure actual 

baseline methane emissions from natural gas distribution systems.

 ■ Replaced more than 1,400 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe, resulting in eliminating more than 95% of the 

methane emissions previously attributed to the cast iron and bare steel infrastructure. 

 ■ Using new technologies to improve measurement and monitoring of methane emissions, including satellite 

technology and real-time measurement devices to pinpoint and repair leaks faster.

 ■ Analyzing the potential procurement of responsibly produced and transported natural gas from suppliers that 

balance low methane emissions with affordable energy for our customers, whenever possible.

 ■ Investing in renewable natural gas (RNG) projects and continuing to work with our jurisdictions to expand RNG 

availability for our customers.

 ■ Sourcing RNG for our compressed natural gas stations, with a pilot project underway. We plan to extend RNG to 

our publicly accessible fueling stations, further increasing the environmental benefit of CNG.

We will achieve our transformative goals by adopting the use of new and existing energy technologies, alternative fuels 
like RNG and hydrogen, and by collaborating with policymakers, industry peers and external partners on how best to 
meet this challenge.

KEY STAKEHOLDER ISSUES
STAKEHOLDER AND MATERIAL ISSUES

The Importance of Our Stakeholders

We are committed to a future that offers reliable, accessible and affordable clean energy for all customers and areas 
we serve and to making a positive impact on our communities. This requires that we consider the needs and concerns 
of a diverse stakeholder audience, which includes customers, shareholders, regulators, environmental organizations, 
social advocates, community agencies, elected officials, employees, and many others. Doing so requires that we get 
their perspectives early and often and work together to develop and deliver smart energy solutions. We engage and 
interact (both remotely and one-on-one). We hold open houses. We listen before we act.

Customers: Access to affordable, reliable and 
increasingly clean energy

Communities: Collaborative partners in creating 
stronger, more inclusive and vibrant economies

Suppliers: Collaborators in the clean energy transition

Investors: Creating long-term returns through financial 
and ESG leadership

policy helps drive change for climate action in a  
way that maintains reliability and affordability  
for customers

NGOs (non-governmental organizations): Provide 
feedback on ESG-related issues and priorities and help 
hold us accountable

Thought Leaders: Key to communicating the clean 
energy transition and different dimensions that matter 
to other relevant stakeholders

16   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Strategic Framework

Having the right data and insight is key to understanding the issues that are most important to our stakeholders and to 
us. Our goal is to better identify, assess and prioritize issues, and ensure that we continue to build an ESG focus that 
responds to external events, evolving business priorities, stakeholder expectations, and our own performance results. 

Using new and dynamic data gathering technology is our way forward and it will empower the decisions we make. 
That said, we continue to rely on insight gleaned from sources such as stakeholder feedback, surveys, reporting and 
rating frameworks, thought leader perspectives, social and traditional media coverage.

Mapping it all out

We have mapped our priority issues to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to “end 
poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.” Since their development in 2015, the 17 SDGs have gained 
traction with stakeholders concerned about sustainability issues. While there was alignment between our priorities 
and several of the SDGs, goals such as “Seven: Affordable and Clean Energy,” and “Thirteen: Climate Action,” are 
especially applicable to our company. 

We use a data-driven and dynamic process for ESG risk identification and monitoring, focusing on these important 
topics and key priorities:

Justice, Equity 
and Inclusion

  Just transition
  Environmental justice
  Respect for  
human rights

  Enhanced energy  
equity programs
  Social justice and  

racial equity 

Climate Resiliency

Vibrant Economies

  Climate change 

and risk management
  Disaster preparedness 

and relief

  Biodiversity and  
natural capital

  Supply chain
  Workforce development 

and job creation

  Economic development

Employees, Customers 
and Communities 

  Employee health 

and safety

  Employee diversity, 
equity and inclusion
  Talent development
  Charitable giving

Stakeholder engagement is a critical enabler underpinning these priorities.

ENVIRONMENTAL

Seizing the opportunity  
to deliver cleaner energy.

22   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

ENVIRONMENTAL

Duke Energy is leading one of the most ambitious 
clean energy transformations in our industry. We 
have a $63 billion five-year capex plan of which 82% 
($52 billion) includes investments in our generating 
fleet’s transition to low- and zero-carbon resources and 
a modernized grid. We have set goals for achieving 
at least a 50% carbon reduction from 2005 levels 
for electricity generation and to reduce our methane 
emissions from natural gas distribution to net-zero by 
2030. We have also set an ambitious goal to reach 
net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 
2050. In February 2022, we broadened our greenhouse 
gas emission reduction goals by incorporating Scope 
2 and certain Scope 3 emissions. For the electric 
business, this means we will include CO2 emissions 
from purchased power for our use, greenhouse gas 
emissions from purchased power for resale, and the 
upstream emissions related to purchased fossil fuels 
for generation.

Additionally, we set an enterprisewide goal of exiting 
coal generation by 2035 as evidenced by the preferred 
scenarios of our recent integrated resource plans. And 
we will file the first Carbon Plan in North Carolina 
pursuant to House Bill 951 that will recommend 
several pathways toward meeting the state’s carbon 
reduction goal of 70% by 2030. We will continue 
to execute our clean energy plan with rate cases to 

accelerate coal retirements, call for more renewables 
and extend the life of the largest regulated nuclear fleet 
in the country.

We are increasing our renewable resources and are a 
top 10 U.S. renewable company by capacity, for our 
combined regulated and commercial business, with 
operations in 25 states. We are also expanding our 
renewable footprint and own, operate or purchased over 
10 gigawatts (GW) of renewables (solar and wind) in 
2021, targeting 24 GW by 2030.

For the natural gas business, we recently added a 
new goal of net-zero methane and carbon emissions 
by 2050 for upstream emissions related to purchased 
natural gas and downstream carbon emissions arising 
from our customers’ consumption.

Our first step will be to take a full inventory of Scope 3 
emissions to establish our baseline and identify what 
steps we may be able to take over time to reduce these 
emissions. Additionally, we are incorporating advanced 
methane leak technologies and recently launched a 
satellite pilot program for methane detection on natural 
gas infrastructure. This pilot program can identify leaks 
as small as a leak on a natural gas meter, enabling us 
to identify and rapidly eliminate leaks on the distribution 
system. We continue to innovate, test, and deploy other 
methane detection technologies.

We look to identify the concrete actions we can take 
in the short, medium and long term to reduce our 
emissions as we strive for a cleaner energy future. 

23   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Combining no-emission sources like hydro, nuclear, solar and 
wind generation, approximately 55% of our generation will be 
carbon-free by 2030.

Clean Energy Transition

Net-Zero Carbon 

Climate change is a critical issue that our employees, 
customers, communities and other stakeholders are 
passionate about – as are we. That is why our climate 
strategy is our business strategy. And central to this 
business strategy is delivering increasingly clean 
energy while maintaining reliability, accessibility and 
affordability for our customers.

To address the role of carbon emissions in climate 
change, Duke Energy is taking bold action, with an 
ambitious goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions 
by 2050. Our goal is aligned with the ambitions of the 
Paris Agreement and, in January 2021, we publicly 
announced our support of President Biden’s decision to 
reenter the agreement. 

Attaining our goal in the future requires taking strategic 
action today, which is why we recently announced our 
commitment to the largest planned coal fleet retirement 
in the industry. Subject to regulatory approval, we are 
targeting energy from coal to represent less than 5% 
of our total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal 
by 2035.

While this 2035 announcement is new, it reflects a 
very deliberate, purposeful road map that has been 
years in the making. Since 2010, we’ve retired 56 coal 
units representing approximately 7,500 MW. Already, 
the company has reduced carbon emissions from 
electricity generation by 44% from 2005 levels – the 
equivalent of removing 13 million vehicles from the 
road. By the end of 2035, we expect to retire almost 
16 GW of coal generation – almost a GW a year. 

In the Carolinas we are going even bolder, targeting 
70% carbon reduction in the 2030 time frame – a 
goal outlined by North Carolina’s new clean energy 
legislation, which was signed into law in October 2021 
with bipartisan support. After gathering feedback 
from stakeholders in both North Carolina and South 
Carolina, we’re incorporating this public input into 

our proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan – a road map for 
modernizing our two-state energy system in a manner 
that reduces risks for customers while also lowering 
emissions and balancing affordability and reliability.

Trenton Solar Facility  /  Trenton, Florida

We are well on our way to achieving our systemwide 
target of at least 50% carbon reduction by 2030. 
Achieving our net-zero vision requires us to transition 
to low- and zero-emissions energy, while also making 
strategic investments in grid modernization to integrate 
more renewable energy and energy storage. Our road 
map centers around the following elements:

 ■ Deploying renewables such as solar, wind and 

energy storage at unprecedented rates, expanding 
the renewables we own, operate or purchase from 
10 GW in 2021 to 24 GW in 2030.

 ■ Maintaining and optimizing our carbon-free nuclear 

fleet for peak performance.

 ■ Leveraging natural gas facilities that are hydrogen-
capable, enabling further carbon reductions as 
hydrogen technology evolves.

 ■ Capitalizing on emerging technologies such as 

hydrogen, longer-duration storage, advanced nuclear 
and carbon capture.

 ■ Encouraging supportive public policy at both the 

federal and state levels, as demonstrated by North 
Carolina’s forward-thinking policymakers.

We can grow our business while also addressing the 
greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain, 
focused on methane and carbon. 

We are committed to bringing our customers and 
communities affordable, reliable and clean carbon-
free energy as quickly as possible. You can read more 
about Duke Energy’s strategy to address climate risks 
and deliver a clean energy future on the company’s 
Global Climate Change page.

Regulated and Commercial 
Renewable Energy

Duke Energy is a top 10 U.S. renewable company by 
capacity, with operations in 25 states. By 2050, we 
project renewables will be the largest source of energy 
in our regulated utilities.

Meeting our goals means the company must work with 
stakeholders and regulators in our communities to 
build and connect projects through our regulated and 
commercial renewables businesses. 

With a total renewables portfolio of over 3,000 MW, 
Duke Energy’s Sustainable Solutions, our commercial 
renewable business, brought new wind projects online 
in Oklahoma and Texas during 2021. 

In Oklahoma, the company expanded its Frontier 
Windpower project – its largest with 550 MW of 

25   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Trenton Battery Storage Facility  /  Trenton, Florida 

capacity. In Texas, the company began operation at the 
182-MW Maryneal Windpower project. 

The company’s DESS solar portfolio also continues to 
grow – totaling nearly 180 projects in 16 states. 

Our approach is to enhance our long-serving 
hydroelectric assets while actively deploying the 
advancement of battery storage. We plan to invest more 
than $600 million in battery energy storage by 2025, 
which will help to support our renewables portfolio.

One of the nation’s and Duke Energy’s fastest-growing 
areas for solar power is Florida and in 2021, the 
company expanded solar through its regulated utility 
in the Sunshine State with the addition of 225 MW 
through three new solar power plants. With a combined 
investment of over $2 billion, by 2024, Duke Energy 
Florida’s solar generation portfolio will include 25 
grid-tied solar power plants, which will benefit all 
Florida customers and will provide about 1,500 MW of 
emission-free generation with approximately 5 million 
solar panels installed. 

In both North Carolina and South Carolina, we have 
more than 4,500 MW of solar capacity connected to 
its grid – including company-owned and independent 
projects. We continue to grow our solar portfolio in the 
regulated and commercial businesses as we continue 
on our clean energy transition. 

Energy Storage

There are many facets to energy storage – from 
traditional hydroelectric pump storage to new 
technologies around battery storage. We are projecting 
more than 13,000 MW of energy storage on our system 
by 2050.

Commercial 

The company has almost a decade of experience with 
large-scale battery storage. In 2013, our commercial 
business, DESS, installed one of the largest batteries in 
the nation at its Notrees Wind facility in Texas. DESS 
has about 40 MW of total capacity, with additional 
battery storage sites in Ohio.

Regulated 

The company has over 60 MW of battery energy 
storage in service. By the end of 2022, we will have 
at least 50 MW of battery energy storage in Florida, 
including a battery on Cape San Blas on the Gulf of 
Mexico. In North Carolina, the Hot Springs Microgrid 
was placed in service, which combines a 2-MW 
solar array with a 4.4 MW of battery. This will be the 
company’s largest microgrid – supporting reliable power 
to a small town.

We are testing long duration energy storage 
technologies at our Duke Energy Emerging Technology 
and Innovation Center in Mount Holly, North Carolina. 
Multiple new battery chemistries will be tested in the 
2022-2023 time frame that will influence our future 
deployments at scale.

Catawba Nuclear Station  /  York County, South Carolina

Nuclear

Duke Energy’s 11 nuclear stations provide the 
company’s largest source of carbon-free generation 
as well as baseload, dependable capacity. Continual 
investment in new technologies means our plants 
remain reliable and efficient: 

 ■ Our nuclear fleet matched its record capacity factor 
of 95.72% in 2021, marking the 23rd consecutive 
year with a fleet capacity factor greater than 90%. 

 ■ In 2021, approximately 83% of Duke Energy’s 

carbon-free generation was from nuclear energy, 
and about 37% of our total generation was from 
nuclear energy.

 ■ The Duke Energy nuclear fleet generated more than 
75 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and avoided 
the release of over 50 million tons of carbon dioxide, 
which equates to about 10 million cars no longer on 
the road.

Marking a significant milestone, we submitted the 
subsequent license renewal application to the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission for Oconee Nuclear 
Station in June 2021. Oconee is the company’s largest 
nuclear station with three generating units that produce 
more than 2,500 MW and can provide electricity for 
1.9 million homes. We plan to pursue subsequent 
license renewals for the entire fleet, so these plants 
can safely and reliably continue providing carbon-free 
electricity to customers for decades to come.

In addition, we are supporting and actively involved 
with industry groups and companies researching the 
deployment of advanced nuclear technologies. For 
example, we have partnered with TerraPower and the 
Natrium Reactor team to provide consulting and in-kind 

advisory services for demonstration of the Natrium 
technology, which will provide zero-carbon electricity 
with integrated thermal storage. This project is targeting 
to be operational by 2028.

Natural Gas

As we transition our fleet, we continue to see the need 
for dispatchable resources to ensure that the lights 
come on when our customers flip the switch. This is 
where natural gas plays an important role and will 
enable the acceleration of our coal fleet retirement. 

With our net-zero methane emissions goal for our 
natural gas business by 2030 and our net-zero 
Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions goal 
by 2050 set in early 2022, we have an opportunity 
to lead the industry through our own investments, 
customer programs and relationships with suppliers 
to make meaningful reductions in methane and 
carbon emissions.

This work is essential and consistent with our business 
model to supply reliable, affordable, accessible 
and increasingly clean energy to our communities. 
We can grow our business while also addressing 
greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain, 
while embracing technology and innovation to meet 
our environmental goals.

And, our investments in renewable natural gas 
production facilities provide sought-after renewable 
natural gas supplies to the market, taking advantage of 
the benefits of removing methane from the agriculture 
and waste sectors, and repurposing it for use by end 
users through the existing natural gas pipeline network.

of Emissions

facility and a compressor station. This technology can 
provide immediate alerts and measurement of methane 
leaks if they occur, so that we can take action. 

Our approach to reduce methane is to first identify 
and measure where methane may be emitted within 
our own natural gas operations and eliminate leaks on 
our system. Meanwhile, we are working upstream and 
downstream with suppliers and customers to reduce 
methane and carbon emissions. 

Methane Detection 

Duke Energy announced a new partnership with 
Microsoft and Accenture on the development of a 
technology platform designed to measure actual 
baseline methane emissions from natural gas 
distribution systems. The platform was featured at 
Accenture’s COP26 pavilion in Glasgow, Scotland. 

This unique platform provides near-real-time data 
collection, allowing Duke Energy’s field response teams 
to more rapidly identify and repair methane leaks. It 
also tracks and prioritizes data associated with leaks 
using advanced detection methods such as satellites, 
fixed-wing aircraft and ground-level sensing technology. 
Ongoing satellite captures have proved successful, and 
the company plans on expanding this technology into 
other service territories.

We also have a pilot underway utilizing natural gas-
cloud imaging cameras to continuously monitor and 
measure methane leaks at a Liquefied Natural Gas 

Methane Reduction

We’ve eliminated cast iron and bare steel pipe from our 
system. These pipeline replacements have resulted in 
eliminating more than 95% of the methane emissions 
previously attributed to cast iron and bare steel 
pipe infrastructure.

We’ve also increased the cadence of our leak surveys, 
moving from a requirement for leak surveys every five 
years to performing surveys every three years. We are 
identifying leaks faster and repairing them faster – 
eliminating emissions much more rapidly.

Cross-compression technology is being used in certain 
operational activities such as decommissioning a pipe 
or in-line inspections to eliminate the release of natural 
gas to the atmosphere or flaring the natural gas. This 
technology moves natural gas from a pipeline being 
depressurized into another section of the natural gas 
system and has reduced methane emissions through 
these activities by nearly 99% and saved 2.4 million 
cubic feet of natural gas thus far. 

As part of our expanded net-zero emissions efforts, 
we continue to work with ONE Future, a coalition of 
natural gas companies across the natural gas supply 
chain, to find solutions to make meaningful methane 
emission reductions.

Coal Ash Management

Duke Energy continued to meet the federal and state 
requirements for its coal ash basins and landfills, 
including the EPA’s Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, 
the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act, as well 
as other state and local agreements and orders. 

With all its ash basins removed from service, the 
company has excavated over 38 million tons of coal ash 
in the Carolinas and Midwest, and safely placed it into 
approved facilities. This includes 500,000 tons of ash 
for the concrete market from three newly constructed 
ash reprocessing units required by North Carolina 
House Bill 630. In addition to coal ash, Duke Energy 
recycled over 1,300,000 tons of gypsum to the 
wallboard industry. 

In North Carolina, the Department of Environmental 
Quality has approved all permits required at this time 
to meet our closure plan schedule at sites not utilizing 
beneficiation or reprocessing facilities. These permits 
support the settlement agreement reached with the 
North Carolina Attorney General, the Public Staff 
and Sierra Club. This agreement continues to provide 
benefits to customers and long-term certainty for the 
company and its investors. All Indiana ash basin closure 
plans have been approved by the Indiana Department 
of Environmental Management, and closure activities 
are currently in progress on five basins, complete or 
nearing completion on eight other basins, with nine 
basins remaining to be closed. In South Carolina, half 
the basin ash has been excavated from the two retired 
coal sites, and the single ash pond in Kentucky has 
been excavated. 

Clean Energy Technologies and 
Zero-Emitting Load-Following 
Resources (ZELFRs)

We are taking our clean energy transformation to 
the next level through innovative partnerships and 
technologies. We need zero-emitting load-following 
resources (ZELFRs) that are low carbon or carbon-free 
and can respond to dynamic changes in both customer 
demand and renewable generation. 

While existing clean energy resources like solar, wind 
and nuclear, continue to play an important role in our 
electric generation energy mix, we’re engaged with 
others who are developing new technologies to be 
used at scale by the mid-2030s to achieve our net-zero 
carbon goals while maintaining reliable, affordable and 
accessible energy for the communities we serve. We are 
also actively incorporating advanced new methane leak 
technologies in our natural gas business.

In 2021, Duke Energy partnered with businesses, 
universities, government agencies and industry groups 
to advance new resources capable of following electric 
load over long durations like advanced nuclear, 
hydrogen and long-duration storage. With greater 

integration of variable renewables into the grid, these 
technologies will become increasingly important to 
reliably meet energy needs. For example:

 ■ Advanced nuclear – we have partnered with 
TerraPower and the Natrium Reactor team to 
provide consulting and in-kind advisory services for 
demonstration of the Natrium technology, which 
will provide zero-carbon electricity with integrated 
thermal storage.

 ■ Hydrogen – Duke Energy, Siemens and Clemson 
University began examining how to produce and 
use hydrogen for energy storage and as a low- or 
no-carbon fuel source. In addition, Duke Energy 
sponsored a hydrogen study that included a 
multisector workshop to explore the potential for 
green hydrogen as a decarbonization technology in 
the Carolinas.

 ■ Long-duration storage – a partnership with 

Honeywell and EOS Energy Storage to test new 
flow and zinc-based batteries in the Duke Energy 
Emerging Technology and Innovation Center in 
Mount Holly, North Carolina. In addition, we teamed 
up with Malta to begin studying converting coal units 
into clean energy storage systems.

30   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Additionally, federal infrastructure legislation passed 
at the end of 2021 complements our emerging clean 
energy technology investments by funding additional 
research, development and demonstration projects and 
critical enabling infrastructure. The bipartisan effort 
represents the type of robust and sustained support 
essential to rapidly commercializing and deploying 
needed new technology at scale. 

Grid Modernization 

Our generation transition relies upon modernizing and 
enhancing our energy grid – the largest in the nation. 

That modernization will be a major form of investment 
in the future. We have underway a 10-year storm 
protection plan in Florida and a three-year grid 
improvement plan in North Carolina. This is in addition 
to infrastructure plans in our South Carolina, Ohio and 
Kentucky service territories. In Indiana, the company 
is also in the final year of a seven-year, $1.4 billion 
transmission and distribution modernization plan, 
and has recently filed for a new six-year, $2 billion 
modernization plan.

The investment will better prepare the company for 
extreme weather caused by climate change. Recent 
installations of flood protections around substations in 
North Carolina and South Carolina that have experienced 
historic flooding in recent years will help protect 
vulnerable communities from extended outages like they 

experienced during hurricanes Matthew and Florence. 
When aligned with vegetation management, pole and 
line upgrades, targeted undergrounding of outage-prone 
lines and self-healing technology installation in many of 
the same areas, we can significantly increase resiliency 
and help better protect the local community and 
economy during extreme weather.

We are also leveraging data analytics and technology 
to achieve improvements in energy reliability and 
resiliency, while also supporting our clean energy goals. 

For example, we are installing smart, self-healing 
technology that can automatically detect power 
outages, isolate the problem and then quickly reroute 
service to other available lines to restore power faster. 
In 2021, self-healing technology avoided more than 
700,000 extended outages and saved customers nearly 
1.2 million hours of total outage time.

This same technology also helps enable the two-way 
power flow needed to support growth of renewables 
and distributed technologies like battery storage 
and electric vehicles. When layered with improved 
system control technologies and voltage optimization 
capabilities, the improvements help increase not only 
resiliency, but also improve monitoring and protection 
against physical and cyber risks, enable the growth 
of company-owned and third-party renewables, and 
provide a foundation to help us achieve net-zero carbon 
by 2050.

Duke Energy is installing smart, self-healing technology that can 
automatically detect power outages, isolate the problem and 
then quickly reroute service to other available lines to restore 
power faster.

Low-Emission Vehicles

According to the Edison Electric Institute, as many as 
18 million electric vehicles (EVs) may be on the road by 
2030. This gives us an opportunity to grow our clean 
energy portfolio – with part of that new generation 
helping lower emissions in the transportation sector.

We are a strong supporter of utility involvement in 
emission-free vehicles and are promoting greater access 
to EV charging for all. It’s a major reason we introduced 
comprehensive initiatives to embrace and encourage the 
transition to greater transportation electrification. 

Starting inside the company, we committed to 
electrifying our own fleet. We have pledged to convert 
100% of our nearly 4,000 light-duty vehicles and 50% 
of about 6,000 combined fleet of medium-duty, heavy-
duty and off-road vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids or 
other zero-carbon alternatives by 2030. 

In Florida, the company’s Park and Plug pilot has 
installed more than 600 EV public charging stations 
throughout the state. To date, drivers have used the 
Park & Plug network for almost 130,000 charging 
sessions, displacing more than 215,000 gallons of 
gasoline and installations are in easily accessible 
locations across Florida: 

 ■ 182 public Level 2 chargers at local businesses.

 ■ 52 DC fast chargers in public locations.

 ■ 220 Level 2 chargers in multiunit dwellings.

 ■ 173 Level 2 chargers in workplaces.

The DC fast chargers are in strategic locations 
connecting major and key secondary corridors and 

evacuation routes in Florida. This creates critical 
infrastructure needed for EV adoption and helps reduce 
range anxiety. 

In the Carolinas, regulatory action in 2020 led to EV 
pilot programs being approved. We are now working 
on an expanded suite of EV programs, making it more 
affordable and convenient for customers to access 
EV charging infrastructure. 

An additional pilot program is waiting regulatory 
action in North Carolina; pilot programs are under 
consideration by regulators in Ohio and Indiana. 

The company is evaluating “Make Ready Credit” 
programs to provide credits to reduce the upfront 
cost of upgrading electrical systems to install charging 
infrastructure for homeowners and businesses. In 
addition, we aim to make sure future charging is 
equitable to rural and low- to middle-income areas.

We are a member of the National Electric Highway 
Coalition – a collaboration among electric companies 
committed to enabling installation of EV fast charging 
stations that will allow the public to drive with 
confidence along major U.S. travel corridors by the 
end of 2023.

Elsewhere, the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, 
eTransEnergy, helps large businesses and municipalities 
with all the planning, financing, acquisition and 
deployment services to electrify their fleets. 
eTransEnergy provides unregulated services to assist 
school districts, transit agencies and companies 
across the country achieve their economic and 
sustainability goals as they transition to clean energy 
transportation options.

32   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Harris Lake County Park  /  Wake County, North Carolina

We are also promoting compressed natural gas (CNG) 
vehicles, which help lower overall transportation 
emissions. Around 50% of the fleet at Piedmont 
Natural Gas runs on CNG – a total of almost 700 trucks 
and vehicles. The company owns and operates public 
CNG fueling stations across its three-state territory. We 
started offering RNG at some CNG stations and are 
working on expanding this offering. 

Natural Capital 

Duke Energy’s approach to protecting and enhancing 
biodiversity and natural capital benefits is guided by our 
corporate commitment to Biodiversity, Natural Resource 
Conservation Vision Statement, Corporate Environmental 
and Health & Safety (EHS) Management System. 
We believe we have an obligation to manage the 
natural assets where we operate, including associated 
procedures, mitigation hierarchy process, stewardship 
and conservation projects and Avian Protection Plan. 
We are committed to continue supporting biodiversity 
through the additional development and implementation 
of protective corporate policies, investment in 
conservation projects, environmental initiatives and 
research, and through relationships that will conserve 
biodiversity and important local, regional and national 
ecosystems and habitats.

Water

The water supply in our communities is a public 
resource with multiple stakeholders responsible for 
its protection. We share that commitment with water 
users in the river basins where we operate power 
plants to ensure a resilient water supply is available to 
communities. This shared responsibility is particularly 
important during drought conditions. 

As part of the relicensing process for many of 
Duke Energy’s hydroelectric projects, partnerships were 
created to protect water supplies for all users. These 
groups, called drought management advisory groups, 
developed and use low inflow protocols to establish 
objective criteria and actions for reductions in water 
use, as well as communications pathways during 
periods of low inflow into the basins. 

The goal is to take the actions needed in the basins 
to delay the point at which the available water storage 
inventory is fully depleted. This allows more time for 
rainfall to restore inflows to the lake system. We perform 
a monthly evaluation of different indicators and then 
issue a report to all large water users along each river 
basin. When certain conditions are reached, a drought 
stage is declared, and the users and stakeholders of the 
water supply take certain agreed-upon actions. There 
are five separate drought stages of increasing severity. 

Duke Energy shares that commitment with water users in the river 
basins where we operate power plants to ensure a resilient water 
supply is available to communities.

33   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Mountain Island Hydro Station  /  Gaston County, North Carolina

In the final four months of 2021, the Duke Energy 
rain gauges show several regions received less than 
half the long-term average rainfall for the same period. 
Due to this dry weather, the Low Inflow Protocol in 
the Catawba-Wateree River Basin was implemented. 
It helps major water users in the basin conserve water 
supplies during droughts. This proactive and forward-
thinking approach to managing the shared water supply 
helps mitigate drought risks, and in the Catawba-
Wateree case, risks that affect 26% of Duke Energy’s 
generation operations that depend on that supply. 

Biodiversity

The company’s Corporate Commitment to Biodiversity 
– published in 2021 – offers an outline of how we 
conduct business with respect to biodiversity. Under 
it, Duke Energy uses best management practices, 
procedures, and the mitigation hierarchy process 
(i.e., avoid, minimize, restore/rehabilitate) as an 
integral part of its project planning, siting, construction, 
operational and maintenance decisions. 

Duke Energy also seeks to foster constructive working 
relationships and partnerships with stakeholders 
with respect to biodiversity. Putting that philosophy 
into action, Duke Energy developed the Catawba-
Wateree (CW) and the Keowee-Toxaway (KT) Habitat 
Enhancement Programs (HEP) – cooperative initiatives 

by Duke Energy, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource 
Commission and the South Carolina Department of 
Natural Resources. 

The programs aim to deliver an effective means of 
allowing continued private recreational access while 
providing meaningful habitat creation, enhancement and 
protection activities for fish and wildlife along the shores 
of both the Keowee-Toxaway and the Catawba-Wateree 
Hydroelectric Project reservoirs. 

Since its inception, the programs have provided 
over $3 million in funding to support 108 
environmental projects.

In 2021, the CW HEP funded land conservation efforts 
to remove invasive plants and establish native plants on 
Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake and Lake Wylie. 
Avian nesting boxes were installed on Lake Cedar 
Creek, Great Falls Lake, Rocky Creek Reservoir and 
Fishing Creek Reservoir. 

The KT HEP funded land acquisitions to permanently 
conserve valuable fish and wildlife habitat and place 
artificial fish habitat structures in Lake Keowee. 

This collaborative program ensures the sustainability 
of water and natural resources and recreational 
opportunities for our growing population while also 
meeting energy production needs.

35   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

2021 electricity generated and 
generation capacity

Duke Energy has a diverse, increasingly 
clean generation portfolio. Over 40% of the 
electricity we generated in 2021 was from 
carbon-free sources, including nuclear, wind, 
hydro and solar. Thirty six percent was from 
lower-carbon natural gas, which emits about 
half as much carbon dioxide as coal. And 
about 22% was from higher-carbon coal and 
oil. Taken together, owned and purchased 
renewables are equivalent to almost 11% of 
our electricity generation. 

Fuels consumed for 
electric generation

Since 2008, the use of coal and oil as 
generation fuels has significantly decreased. 
These fuels are being replaced by cleaner 
natural gas and renewables. 

 
 
Water withdrawn and 
consumed for electric 
generation

Water withdrawn is the total volume removed 
from a water source, such as a lake or a river. 
Because of the once-through cooling systems 
on many of our coal-fired and nuclear plants, 
almost 98% of this water is returned to the 
source and available for other uses. Water 
consumed is the amount of water removed 
for use and not returned to the source. 

Emissions from electric 
generation

Many factors influence emissions levels and 
intensities, including demand for electricity, 
generation diversity and efficiency, weather, 
fuel and purchased power prices, and 
emissions controls deployed. Since 2005, our 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased 
by 44%, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions 
decreased by 98% and nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
emissions decreased by over 83%. These 
decreases are primarily due to the addition 
of pollution control equipment for SO2 and 
NOx in previous years, replacement of coal 
generation with natural gas and renewables 
and increased dispatch of cleaner, more 
efficient plants. In 2021, CO2 emissions 
were somewhat higher than in 2020 due to 
increased generation as the economy began 
to rebound, though the long-term reduction 
trend continued.

Methane emissions from  
natural gas distribution

Methane (CH4) is the primary component 
of natural gas and is a greenhouse gas. We 
work to minimize methane emissions, but 
some is released during pipeline operations 
and maintenance. Duke Energy announced in 
October 2020 its goal of reducing methane 
emissions in its natural gas distribution 
companies to net-zero by 2030. The emissions 
reported here are estimates pursuant to EPA 
methodology. The EPA methodology applies 
emissions factors to facility counts such as 
miles of pipe, customer meters, numbers 
of services, and other equipment. As our 
distribution system expands due to customer 
growth, the emissions estimates increase 
because additional facilities are added.

Sulfur hexafluoride emissions

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a greenhouse 
gas that is used as an insulating gas in 
high-voltage electric transmission and 
distribution switchgear. We work to minimize 
SF6 emissions, but some is released during 
operations and maintenance. 

Scope 3 greenhouse gas 
emissions

We are currently working to determine the 
emissions associated with relevant Scope 
3 categories. Then we will prioritize the 
categories for which we have adopted goals 
and identify what actions the company can 
take over time to reduce these emissions.

Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)

Duke Energy’s TRI releases for 2020 were 
down 91% from 2007, primarily due to the 
significant investments we’ve made in 
environmental controls for our power plants, 
and decreased coal generation. Variations in 
releases were largely due to coal ash basins 
and their closure operations. These releases 
are expected to decrease significantly as coal 
ash basins are closed. (Data for 2021 will be 
available in August 2022.)

Waste

Duke Energy nearly met its goal to recycle 
80% of solid waste. We are working on 
strategies to minimize landfilled waste and 
continually improve performance on this goal. 
These strategies include planning to avoid 
waste generation, reuse and repurposing 
of generated materials, identifying reuse 
and recycling technologies and partners, 
and benchmarking with other companies 
to identify best practices. (This goal 
excludes DESS, which has a relatively small 
waste stream.)

Reportable oil spills

Oil spills include releases of lubricating 
oil from generating stations, leaks from 
transformers, or damage caused by weather 
or by third parties (typically because of 
auto accidents). 

Environmental regulatory 
citations

The increase in the number of citations from 
2018 to 2019 was due mostly to an increase 
in water discharge reporting and compliance 
issues, which have been resolved with 
regulatory authorities.

The energy sector must transition for the future in a way that also benefits 
our society today. Our long-term success is deeply intertwined with the 
health and well-being of our employees and the communities we serve. We 
provide tens of thousands of good jobs, invest millions locally, and contribute 
time and resources to public initiatives and nonprofit programs. Through 
strategic actions, we seek to protect the local environment and ensure the 
safety of our people and our customers.

Our efforts include providing well-paying jobs, offering opportunities for 
employees to grow and advance in their careers, and increasing the diversity 
of our teams across the company. These actions help us better reflect 
the communities we serve and ultimately, be a better employer and local 
partner. They also help ensure that we have the talent and the skills we need

Energy Equity

Duke Energy’s Electric Rates 

In effect as of summer 2021  
(cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh))

We recognize energy bills can be a burden for many of our 
economically vulnerable households.

Residential

In 2021, Duke Energy founded its vulnerable customer 
team to better aid underserved and low-income 
customers. One example of this is a new centralized 
agency team that works directly with assistance agencies 
across our service territories to make it as easy as possible 
for them to help our customers. More than $100 million 
was applied to the energy bills of customers in need. 
Employee donations, customer donations, state and 
federal dollars, hundreds of local agencies, Duke Energy 
Foundation grants, and countless others helped answer 
the call for assistance.

In North Carolina, Duke Energy and the state government 
implemented the North Carolina moratorium in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting more than 
100,000 customers from disconnection, extending time 
to apply for assistance funds, and extending payment 
arrangements past-due balances. 

In South Carolina and Florida, we are working 
with the Emergency Rental Assistance Program 
(ERAP) to pilot streamlined application processes 
to reduce documentation and expedite approvals for 
eligible customers.

In North Carolina and Indiana, we are teaming up with 
other utilities and state government on low-income 
collaboratives to define a strategic framework of rates, 
programs, and regulatory parameters that can further 
energy equity in each state. 

In November, we launched our Share the Light Fund 
designed to provide increased financial assistance and 
make it easier for customers to give and get help with 
energy bills. The fund raised $1 million more in its 
inaugural year than we raised the previous year. And the 
Duke Energy Foundation matches every dollar donated up 
to $500,000. 

Following Hurricane Ida, we sent nearly 500 resources – 
lineworkers, vegetation management crews and damage 
assessors – and donated nearly $1 million worth of

Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is an important tool for our business 
– it helps customers by reducing energy costs, 
the company by reducing electric load, and for the 
environment since less energy used generally means 
less emissions. 

In 2021, we exceeded energy efficiency goals by 
achieving a cumulative reduction in customer energy 
consumption of 21,361 GWh at year’s end – equivalent 
to the annual energy usage of 1.78 million homes. We 
also reduced cumulative peak demand by 6,929 MW. 

As the pandemic continued to impact lives in 2021, 
we helped customers manage energy costs while 
improving access to their homes’ specific energy 
profiles, including:

 ■ Home Energy Reports (MyHER) reports – individual 
reports for over 2.6 million residential customers 
each month. With the information, customers 
can make meaningful decisions about their own 
energy use.

 ■ New, modernized billing and technology system 
– for customers in the Carolinas and Florida, new 
billing and payment options, improved digital 
experience with more self-service choices, and 
insights into energy use and spending. In December, 

71% of enrollments in payment assistance programs 
and 70% of billing program enrollments were 
completed via the new self-service methods. 

 ■ Direct outreach – through grassroots awareness 
campaigns, the company used a wide variety 
of communications tactics to deliver important 
messages about higher bills. We provided customers 
with tools to help them manage their bills, reduce 
energy use, and save money. 

 ■ Program and engagement options – to simplify 

next steps for customers that want to take action 
to save energy and money, the company’s Online 
Marketplace, retailer discount and in-home 
assessments continue to be cost-effective choices 
for customers.

 ■ Piedmont Natural Gas has provided funding for 

low-income weatherization assistance programs that 
provide a more energy-efficient and comfortable 
home environment for the customers served. 

 ■ Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky employee volunteers 

assembled hundreds of winter weatherization 
kits that were handed out to customers. The 
weatherization kits were distributed in partnership 
with community organizations across Ohio and 
Kentucky, and included items such as draft stoppers, 
window insulation, outlet covers, weatherstripping, 
etc. to help customers prepare for the cold winter 
months and make their homes more energy efficient 
to cut down on their energy costs.

As we look to 2022 and beyond, contemporary options 
such as time-based rate options, program bundles, and 
education and tools around electric vehicle charging will 
provide even more value for customers.

Customer Experience 

Customer satisfaction (CSAT) continues to improve. The company not only 
maintained higher than targeted CSAT performance throughout the year as 
measured by proprietary studies, but also improved satisfaction as measured 
by J.D. Power, which provides a benchmark of our performance compared to 
other utilities. 

Four of our utilities ranked as top quartile performers among large utilities 
nationally in 2021 – outgaining the industry and delivering increasingly 
consistent performance across jurisdictions. 

In 2021, we implemented a new, modernized billing and technology system 
for customers in the Carolinas and Florida that introduced new billing and 
payment options, delivered an improved digital experience with more self-
service choices, and provides more insights into energy use and spending. 

These changes are part of our commitment to offer more convenience and 
flexible options that make it easier for customers to do business with us. So 
far, our customers are taking advantage of these new options. In December, 
71% of enrollments in payment assistance programs and 70% of billing 
program enrollments were completed via the new self-service methods. 

Through grassroots awareness campaigns, the company used a wide variety 
of communications tactics to deliver important messages about higher 
bills. Designated webpages, video, social and traditional media, direct-to-
consumer communications, fact sheets and more armed customers with 
tools to help them manage their bills, reduce energy use, and save money.

Economic Development

Our communities depend on economic growth, and we 
play an important role. 

In 2021, the company’s economic development team 
helped attract approximately 12,500 new jobs and 
$6.2 billion in capital investment to six states served by 
the company’s electric utilities: North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.

The 26-person team focused on several key business 
sectors – aerospace, data centers, advanced 
manufacturing, automotive, life sciences and food/
beverage processing.

In addition, the team evaluated 20 properties for 
potential business and industrial development through 
Duke Energy’s Site Readiness Program. The program 
– in partnership with local economic development 
agencies – identifies potential industrial sites, assesses 
the sites’ strengths and weaknesses, facilitates 
improvements at the sites, and markets the sites to 
future businesses.

Since 2005, the program has evaluated 327 sites 
– with 81 “project wins,” generating $12.5 billion in 
capital investment and 17,073 jobs.

Site Selection magazine named Duke Energy to its 
“Top Utilities in Economic Development” list for the 
17th consecutive year.

We are mindful that our principles may evolve as we continue to 
engage stakeholders on environmental justice concerns.

Environmental Justice and  
the Just Transition

The energy sector must transition for the future in a 
way that also benefits our society today. Our long-term 
success is deeply intertwined with the health and 
well-being of the communities we serve.

We have a couple of opportunities to engage with our 
communities through this transition: environmental 
justice and just transition.

Environmental Justice

We believe environmental justice is a business 
imperative, fundamental to our operations and a pillar 
of meaningful stakeholder engagement. We continually 
look for new ways to identify, communicate and 
engage with those potentially affected by infrastructure 
projects. Over the past year, we have worked with both 
internal and external stakeholders to build upon the 
principles that guide our work.

We recognize and understand the importance of both 
the impact of our work on communities as well as the 
importance of early engagement. We believe in being 
transparent on what we are trying to accomplish, 
seeking feedback and input, and adjusting and aligning 
where possible to bring about the best outcomes for the 
communities we serve. As we have talked to subject 
matter experts in the environmental justice field, we 
have learned there is an opportunity to create access 
to opportunities like jobs and economic development 
to help communities benefit from the clean energy 
transition. Our communities care about these issues 
and want to be included in the discussion.

Internally, our teams are purposeful in asking critical 
questions about projects and their associated 
impacts. We’re building a process that includes early 

development, analysis and assessment. In fact, we’ve 
taken significant steps forward to internalize our 
environmental justice principles.

A few examples include:

 ■ Improving the quality and rigor of our screening 

process by incorporating the latest EPA screening tools 
and industry best practices as well as accounting for 
environmental justice inputs as we plan projects.

 ■ Working with our community relations managers to 
help identify disadvantaged communities early in 
project development to engage in more meaningful 
and authentic stakeholder engagement.

 ■ Improving the way we communicate environmental 

justice analysis to permitting agencies, policymakers 
and community members. This will help ensure 
we’re identifying the most critical community 
concerns earlier in the process and working toward 
constructive solutions.

We are mindful that our principles may evolve as we 
continue to engage stakeholders on environmental 
justice concerns. 

Just Transition

As we navigate the largest planned coal retirement 
in the industry, we are being intentional in how we 
approach a fair, equitable and just transition for our 
employees, customers and communities. We are 
building from our past work, as we have already 
learned a great deal in previous coal retirements where 
we’ve meaningfully addressed impacts to workers 
and communities.

In 2021, we conducted a benchmarking exercise to 
determine best practices guided by groups who are 
experts in this space. We are also leaning in to better 
understand what the needs are across a diverse set 
of stakeholders including local governments and 

45   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

nonprofits. The results of the benchmarking and 
this important dialogue will inform our next steps in 
developing our long-term strategy. 

Duke Energy, our customers and our local communities 
all benefit from us retaining and refocusing our 
workforce, and we have a proven record of successfully 
placing employees impacted by plant retirements 
in other positions with the company. In April 2021, 
we initiated a multiskilled training pilot program for 
500 coal plant employees in North Carolina. The 
program includes about 100 hours of traditional 
classroom, computer-based and on-the-job training. 
The additional training provides employees with 
the skills needed to generate reliable power for our 
customers during the transition and prepare to operate 
and maintain cleaner technologies, including natural 
gas, solar and battery storage.

As we retire our coal fleet, we will continue to serve 
those communities. Our employees have deep roots 
in the communities where they live and work, often 
making financial contributions and volunteering 
their time and talent to advance the mission of 
local organizations.

We are determined to meet the energy needs of 
customers today and into the future and we are meeting 
with community leaders to gain input into the coal plant 
retirement plans. We want to create solutions that work 
for customers, communities and employees. This will 
continue to be an important conversation as we – along 
with our stakeholders – strive for a cleaner energy 
future for all.

New opportunity

Beyond traditional means of development, we 
are focused on building a more flexible workforce 
to execute our clean energy transition. A key 
component of our development strategy includes 
leveraging temporary assignments or “gigs” 
outside of an employee’s current role. This helps 
employees learn new skills and expand their 
network of relationships. 

Allison Hampton has been with Duke Energy 
for 34 years. She joined the company as a 
technician in 1987 after earning a two-year 
degree in electronics and electro-mechanical 
technology. Allison had the opportunity to 
participate in a digital transformation gig 
assignment. She saw this as a chance to broaden 
her horizons, bring her diverse skill set to other 
areas of the company, and expand her network. 
This ultimately led to a new role for Allision as 
Product Analyst. 

“This is the best job of my 34 years,” Allison 
said. “It uses all of my talents, everything I have 
learned through the years as a craft worker, and 
my computer skills. It makes me feel that I’m 
able to leverage all of my skills and knowledge 
to help make a better work environment. It’s like

Charitable Giving 

Our purpose to “power the lives of our customers 
and the vitality of our communities” underpins how 
we support employees, customers and communities 
through one of the largest clean energy transformations 
in our industry. 

The Duke Energy Foundation spent the past year 
listening, learning and adjusting to stakeholder 
feedback on a variety of topics from pandemic 
impacts to environmental justice. These conversations 
led to deepening our focus on root causes and 
system challenges.

We believe by focusing the Duke Energy Foundation on 
the topics we are best positioned to address, leveraging 
the unique capabilities of both our company and our 
Foundation, we can deliver the best outcome for our 
communities. Through this holistic approach, we are 
prioritizing three pillars, each of which includes a broad 
suite of adjacent topics:

 ■ Vibrant economies

 ■ Climate resiliency 

 ■ Justice, equity and inclusion

In addition, our process for grantmaking and community 
engagement opportunities is evolving to be more 
customizable and community based. Beginning in 
the Carolinas, we are prioritizing our efforts on the 
community challenges that intersect with the clean 
energy transformation. Our approach will help ensure 
our business responds to community needs while also 
being intentional about supporting work where we

can have the most positive impact. In addition, we 
are aligning our employee volunteerism to reflect our 
strategic direction. In 2021, over 70,000 hours were 
donated to local projects. Pandemic-related limitations 
required us to suspend many in-person volunteer 
events, and look forward to supporting our communities 
through volunteerism in 2022.

We have seen this approach work effectively over the 
past two years in our COVID-19 relief efforts and our 
commitment to social justice and racial equity. We have 
also focused on the diversity of the organizations we 
support. Last year 53% of our grantee organizations 
were led by women or people of color. 

Our refreshed strategy is already delivering results 
for the communities where we operate. In November 
2021, the Foundation team in South Carolina directed 
$250,000 toward a month-long hunger relief campaign 
across the state, prioritizing food insecurity and 
inequity. Part of the program included nearly $150,000 
in microgrants including a food share program delivering 
boxes to those who may not have access to fresh food.

We believe this strategy will deliver more meaningful 
community engagement and outcomes, shifting us to 
more collaborative relationships to solve the challenges 
associated with the clean energy transition together.

EMPLOYEES 

Safety

Our commitment to safety helps us attract the 
best workers possible as we continue our clean 
energy transformation.

For the seventh consecutive year, we expect to be an 
industry leader for safety as measured by Total Incident 
Case Rate (TICR). TICR is a measure of how the 
company uses its safety programs to protect employees 
from injuries. The company’s TICR rose slightly in 
2021 to 0.36 (the lower the number, the better), but 
performance remains better than in 2018 and 2019.

Though company leaders are pleased with this 
performance and recordable injuries have steadily 
declined during the last decade, serious injuries 
or fatalities (SIFs) have plateaued. In 2021, the 
company recorded one employee work-related fatality 
and 15 SIFs. In addition, there were two contractor 
work-related fatalities. We aim for no work-related 
fatalities each year.

To reduce SIFs, we worked with the Edison Electric 
Institute (EEI) and industry leaders to design and 
implement a new high-energy hazard detection 

48   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Frontier Windpower II  /  Kay County, Oklahoma 

and mitigation program. Our historical injury data 
showed that over 50% of our SIFs result from 
high-energy hazards.

The program identifies 13 high-energy hazards that are 
most likely to cause serious injuries or fatalities, such as 
falls from elevation, electrical energy, and motor vehicle 
or equipment accidents. It helps employees prioritize 
their actions to reduce or eliminate these hazards 
and includes a platform for consistently sharing best 
practices and lessons learned from events across the 
utility industry. 

COVID-19 Response

Employee safety remains paramount for us, which 
includes our response to COVID-19.

Human Capital Management

The energy industry is in the midst of a massive 
transformation, and we must have an innovative, 
talented team of professionals who represent the 
diversity of the customers we serve as a foundation 
for success. We are being very intentional about 
our actions.

Creating opportunities for employees to learn 
and develop

We are focused on identifying talent in the organization 
and providing coaching and development to build 
a strong pipeline of leaders. We are also providing 
learning solutions for upskilling and reskilling employees 
to support business transformation and are leveraging 
technology and innovation more than ever before. 

Due to the essential nature of generating energy 24/7, 
nearly half of the company’s employees have remained 
in the workplace since the start of the pandemic in 
2020. The other half, who had been working remotely, 
started returning to the workplace in 2021. 

As part of the company’s clean energy transition, we 
are providing additional training to coal plant workers 
to support this transformation and continue our track 
record of successfully placing employees impacted by 
plant retirements in other positions within the company.

The company has managed COVID-19 through its 
Incident Support team, rigorous case management 
program and continued to follow Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. 
We instituted wearing face coverings, social distancing 
and maintaining office buildings at 50% capacity. In 
addition, we have consistently monitored both internal 
and external COVID-19 trends and our exemplary 
response resulted in internal testing rates less than 
10% of the community CDC positive case rates.

We also made home test kits available to employees 
and continue to keep employees informed on ways to 
stay safe and healthy. 

In 2021, we launched a talent marketplace across 
our company, where employees can find short-term 
development opportunities (“gigs”) to expand and 
broaden their network of relationships. Already, 
over 400 gig positions have been filled. Not only 
does this grow our workforce’s capabilities, but 
it also helps employees identify and follow new 
career paths throughout the company, supporting 
retention and bringing new insights to support our 
transformation efforts.

Ensuring our employees feel heard, 
included and enabled

We believe when employees are engaged, they are 
motivated to show up to work every day to contribute 
to our purpose of powering the lives of our customers 
and the vitality of our communities. Building a culture 
of transparency by engaging in continuous dialogue with 
our employees is important, so last year we transitioned 
to an ongoing survey strategy.

“The Voice” survey is the primary tool we use to 
measure employee engagement, motivation and to get 
feedback. The survey uses Net Promoter Score – a well-
known customer loyalty metric – to gauge employees’ 
likelihood to recommend Duke Energy or Piedmont 
Natural Gas as a place to work to a friend or colleague. 

We are showing good progress. We had a survey response 
rate of 40% and our overall employee Net Promoter Score 
(eNPS), or how likely teammates are to recommend our 
company as a place to work, increased to 30 (up five 
points over 2020 results). 

Real-time listening also allows us to better understand 
employee trends to guide our actions. In 2020, 
employees told us they needed more information about 
the company’s clean energy strategy and direction. We 
developed a plan to increase communication about 
our strategy from our most senior leaders down to our 
front-line workers, and as a result, we saw a five-point 
increase in employees indicating they had a better 
understanding and optimism about our future.

The survey also shows that employees feel proud to 
work at Duke Energy and are motivated to help the 
company reach its goals. The highest performing 
dimensions are teamwork and ethics and safety (both 
89% favorable). Of particular note, 92% of employees 
said their immediate manager supports diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace and 93% of employees 
agree that their teams collaborate and are committed to 
delivering high-quality work.

Evolving the way employees work

In 2021, we introduced a new hybrid workplace model 
– WorkSmart – providing employees an opportunity to 
maintain the flexibility they desire, while also allowing 
us to reignite some of the most important aspects of 
our collaborative culture. Approximately 80% of our 
office-based workforce will participate in the new hybrid 
workplace model. 

In 2021, as employees who were working remotely 
began to transition back into the workplace, the 
company continued to maintain safety protocols that 
were proven effective at preventing the spread of the 
virus within the workplace – including social distancing, 
wearing face coverings, limiting space occupancy and 
making testing available for those who want an extra 
level of confidence. COVID-19 may never fully go away 
– fortunately, our safety protocols and flexible workplace 
model enable us to continue serving our customers and 
communities with confidence.

Support for Employee Well-Being

We support our employees physically and emotionally 
through our wellness and mental health programs and 
provide webinars and coaching focused on improving 
financial wellness. As we entered the second year of 
a global pandemic, we launched a new, inclusive and 
flexible well-being program, Duke Energy WellPower 
Rewards. This program helps employees take care of 
themselves and their families and rewards employees 
for participation in over 50 activities.

We continue to support employees who experience 
financial hardships through our Relief4Employees 
program and provided pandemic assistance to more 
than 450 employees.

Building a diverse and inclusive culture 

Diversity, equity and inclusion is a business imperative 
that is wired in how we power communities and run our 
business. The accountability and support for diversity 

50   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

and inclusion starts at the top with our leadership team. 
Our executive team leaders take ownership for driving 
diversity and inclusion goals forward. 

We are guided by our vision of an inclusive environment 
where all people are valued, respected and encouraged 
to reach their full potential. And we pursue a strategy 
that integrates diversity and inclusion into everything 
we do. This goes beyond race and gender. It includes 
diversity of thought, work and life experiences, 
perspectives and cultures. We work hard to help ensure 
all employees feel that they have an equitable and 
inclusive experience, leveraging our employee resource 
groups as well as diversity and inclusion councils. In 
2021, we launched a new employee resource group to 
represent Native American employees.

In addition, we’ve developed a portfolio of training for 
all employees to build our knowledge and understanding 
of diversity, equity and inclusion, and build skills and 
capabilities for creating a more inclusive workplace.

Fair and Equitable Compensation

We are committed to providing market competitive, 
fair, and equitable compensation by regularly reviewing 
employee pay, and conducting internal pay equity 
reviews and benchmarking against peer companies to 
ensure our pay is competitive.

Attracting Diverse Talent

We are intentional about our actions to attract 
diverse talent.

We continuously evaluate our practices across the hiring 
life cycle to attract a talented and diverse workforce to 
deliver on our commitments to customers. We have a 
dedicated team focused on building relationships with 
four-year colleges and technical schools, as well as 
community organizations to strengthen diversity in our 
future pipeline of talent. 

2021: Our most diverse recruiting year ever

People of Color 
New Hires

In 2021, we partnered to create a historically Black 
colleges and universities (HBCU) Energy Leadership 
Pathway pilot program with four HBCUs located in 
North Carolina and South Carolina. This program will 
provide students of color with mentoring, internships, 
and access to the rapidly evolving clean energy 
workforce. Also in 2021, we hosted a couple of virtual 
diverse HBCU campus recruiting events and moving 
forward are expanding our active recruitment at several 
HBCUs in our service territories. 

Courageous Conversations

“Let’s Talk About It” is a series of organized events 
held around possibly difficult, but necessary and 
thought-provoking topics, that help build understanding 
and awareness and support an inclusive workplace. 
In 2021, we had 50 sessions with nearly 6,000 
employees attending.

An empowered, diverse workforce and inclusive 
workplace makes us a stronger company and provides 
a competitive advantage for connecting with the ever-
changing needs of our customers and communities.

Delivering results with

54   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

GOVERNANCE

We have adopted a management approach to ESG that 
engages all levels of the company from the Board of 
Directors to our employees. We also strive to embed 
sustainable business practices throughout the company. 

The Board of Directors oversees all ESG strategies and 
issues. This places an emphasis on the oversight of 
ESG only because our Board of Directors understands 
the importance of those issues to the long-term 
success and vitality of the company, our customers and 
communities. Some of the key ESG risks that the Board 
of Directors focuses on are climate and environmental 
operations and regulations; human capital management; 
diversity, equity and inclusion; cybersecurity, including 
our information technology and operational technology 
systems; political expenditures; and ESG disclosures. 

On environmental and climate matters, the Board of 
Directors reviewed issues related to our climate strategy 
opportunities and risks at every regularly scheduled 
meeting in 2021 and invited outside speakers to 
discuss these issues on several occasions. The topics 
included discussions of emerging technologies, carbon 
emissions reduction goals, generation fleet transition, 
customer needs related to low-carbon energy, and 
federal and state policy. 

The Compensation and People Development Committee 
also reviews issues regarding employee engagement 
trends, diversity and inclusion goals, and progress on 
those goals, and pandemic-related workforce issues. 
This committee incorporated a qualitative climate 
goal into our short-term incentive plan in 2021.  
The goal focuses on demonstrating leadership to 
advance our climate strategy to achieve our net-zero 
goals, advocating for public policy that supports 

our climate strategy, and investing in clean energy, 
including renewables, to support higher levels of 
carbon-free generation. In 2022, a quantitative goal 
was incorporated into the short-term incentive plan for 
our senior executives.

Several other committees on the Board of Directors 
cover areas of ESG oversight. The Corporate 
Governance Committee regularly discusses charitable 
contributions and priority areas, including contributions 
for diversity initiatives in the communities that our 
utilities serve. The Operations and Nuclear Oversight 
Committee is responsible for the oversight of our 
carbon-free nuclear fleet as well as environmental 
operations and safety. The Finance and Risk 
Management Committee is responsible for the oversight 
of our enterprise risk assessment, including ESG risks, 
and also responsible for the review and approval of 
major capital projects, such as large renewable projects 
or the construction of new generation assets. And the 
Audit Committee is responsible for the review of any 
ESG matters that are included in the periodic reports 
filed with the SEC.

Board of Director refreshment continued in 2021. 
We announced Michael Browning, who has served 
as Duke Energy’s independent lead director since 
2016, would retire from the Board at the end of his 
current one-year term. Upon Browning’s retirement, 
Ted Craver will succeed Browning as the Board’s 
independent lead director. In recent years, the Board 
has focused on refreshment with respect to diversity, 
and is 50% diverse in terms of gender, racial and 
ethnic diversity. In 2021, four new directors were 
added. Most recently, Idalene Kesner, dean of Indiana 
University’s Kelley School of Business, joined as a 
new director, and in 2022, Derrick Burks, a former 
managing partner at global professional services 
company EY also joined.

Board Governance 

Effective corporate governance continues to be a 
critical component to the success of our business 
strategy. Our Board of Directors, led by our Chair, 
President and CEO Lynn Good, provides the leadership 
and guidance that drives sustainable, long-term value 
for our stakeholders, employees, customers and the 
communities we serve.

Our Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s 
long-term strategy to provide clean, reliable and 
affordable energy to our customers. As part of this 
oversight, the Board focuses on ESG matters, goals and 
strategies, as well as how our company’s performance 
metrics and incentives align with those goals.

The Board regularly reviews its composition to ensure 
that its collective membership has the skills to meet 
the needs of the business and reflects a diversity of 
perspectives and experiences.

The Board is structured with a strong independent 
lead director role that assists the chair and CEO in 
setting agendas, approves meeting schedules, and 
leads the independent members of the Board in 
executive committee sessions at each meeting, among 
other responsibilities.

All members of the Board, except Lynn Good, are 
independent and comprise the five committees: Audit, 
Compensation and People Development, Corporate 
Governance, Finance and Risk Management, and 
Operations and Nuclear Oversight. The committees 
oversee all operational, financial, strategic and 
reputational risks as set forth in their respective 
committee charters. 

For more information about our Board of Directors, 
see the proxy statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting 
of Shareholders and the corporate governance section

Executive Compensation 

We maintain a market-based, metrics-driven executive 
compensation program, designed to: 

 ■ Attract and retain talented executives and other 

key employees.

 ■ Align executives’ interests with those of stakeholders, 
including shareholders, employees and customers. 

 ■ Link pay to performance. 

 ■ Emphasize performance-based compensation to 
motivate executives and other key employees. 

 ■ Reward individual performance. 

 ■ Encourage long-term commitment to Duke Energy.

The company meets these objectives through a mix 
of compensation that includes base salary, short-term 
incentives, and long-term incentives consisting of 
performance shares and restricted stock units.

To support clean energy initiatives, we measure the 
performance of our nuclear and renewable generation 
assets through a reliability index under the company’s 
short-term incentive (STI) plan. 

The Board of Directors’ Compensation and People 
Development Committee added a qualitative climate 
goal to the STI plan in 2021, further bolstering the 
company’s commitment to decarbonization. For 

2022, a quantitative metric based on non-emitting 
MW capacity growth was added to the STI plan for 
senior executives.

Other key components of the company’s compensation 
program include:

 ■ Safety metric – to ensure safety remains the 

company’s top priority, with the goal of an injury-
free workplace; based on the “total incident case 
rate” among employees (defined as the number 
of recordable safety incidents per 100 workers, 
using U.S. Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration criteria).

 ■ Environmental events metric – to ensure the 

company’s commitment to the environment; based 
on the number of reportable environmental events.

 ■ Customer satisfaction metric – to prioritize the 
customer experience and customers’ growing 
demand for cleaner energy; based on a composite 
of customer satisfaction survey results for each 
business area.

We regularly review our compensation program and 
performance metrics with the Board’s Compensation 
and People Development Committee, revising as 
needed. For more information about our compensation 
practices, see the proxy statement for the 2022 Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders.

Financial Results 

We operate in constructive regulatory environments 
with attractive growth profiles. Our robust capital plan 
and proven ability to deploy capital efficiently position 
the company to deliver strong, consistent, and enduring 
benefits to our customers, communities and investors. 

The company benefited from growth in our core 
businesses, constructive rate case outcomes and 
continued cost management execution. As a result, we 
announced 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $5.24, 
above the midpoint of the company’s updated earnings 
guidance range.

Based on the momentum we generated in 2021, we 
are accelerating our clean energy transformation and 
plan to deploy over $130 billion in capital investments 

over the next decade, with $63 billion of investments 
occurring over the next five years. This represents a 
$4 billion increase over our previous five-year plan.

Over 80% of our capital plan through 2026 will 
fund investments in our fleet transition and grid 
modernization. This will improve reliability and resiliency 
as we add more renewables to the system and extend 
the life of our carbon-free nuclear fleet to better 
meet the needs of the growing number of customers 
we serve.

As part of our strategy, in 2021, we implemented 
a Sustainable Financing Framework to define the 
categories of investments that are aligned with our 
ESG priorities. Since 2018, Duke Energy has issued 
$5.5 billion in green and sustainability bonds. 

60   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Our sizable capital plan, high-growth service territories, 
proven capability to control costs, and constructive 
regulatory frameworks give us confidence in our ability 
to achieve our 2022 earnings guidance range of $5.30 
– $5.60, with a midpoint of $5.45. Through 2026, 
we expect annualized earnings growth of 5% to 7% 
off the $5.15 midpoint of our original 2021 earnings 
guidance range.

Our ability to execute our robust capital program is 
underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and we remain 
committed to maintaining our current credit ratings, and 
the long-term value proposition we offer shareholders.

In 2021, for the 95th consecutive year, the company 
paid a dividend to its investors. We remain committed 
to continued growth of the dividend, targeting a payout 
ratio of between 65% to 75%.

Sustainable Financing Framework

Driving a clean energy transition, we launched a new 
framework to attract billions of dollars of investments 
in eligible green and social projects. Our Sustainable 
Financing Framework defines the investment areas 
aligned to our clean energy strategy, further enabling 
us to issue green and sustainability bonds, loans or 
other financing instruments. We have a $63 billion 
capex plan over the next five years, over 80% of 
which represents investments toward our clean energy 
transition and grid modernization.

Our long-term investment strategy will provide 
sustainable environmental, social and customer benefits 
as we work to achieve our net-zero goals. 

Eligible project categories include, but are not limited 
to investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, 
advanced grid technology, climate change adaptation, 
and expanded opportunities for diverse suppliers and 
small businesses. 

Since 2018, we have issued $5.5 billion in green and 
sustainability bonds. The framework strengthens our 
commitment to sustainable financing and broadens 
the scope of eligible projects to align with our ESG 
priorities. Green and sustainability bonds can make an 

economic difference in what we will have to pay for 
debt through bond sales, which translates into long-
term customer savings. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

As interest around climate change and the company’s 
clean energy transition continues to grow, we are 
leveraging our enterprisewide risk management 
philosophy to ensure that risks associated with climate 
change are identified, assessed and managed. 

We are peering into the next decade and beyond 
to identify, assess and manage climate-related 
risks, including risks to physical infrastructure, 
risks associated with our transition to clean energy 
sources, risks related to the development of the new 
technologies needed for that transition, and the risks 
and impacts of federal and state energy policies. 

To manage these risks effectively, we include climate 
change considerations in our annual Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) process. The ERM process is 
used to identify potential risks to corporate profitability 
and value and provides a framework to respond in an 
integrated and informed fashion. 

Business unit leaders across the company analyze risks 
and determine how we can best address near-term and 
long-term risks. The Finance and Risk Management 
Committee of the Board is also integral in reviewing 
the annual enterprise risk assessment, and the Board 
routinely discusses climate risk governance. 

We incorporate climate, technology, and economic 
risks into our long-term planning through integrated 
resource plans for each of our regulated electric 
utility companies. These 10-, 15- and 20-year plans, 
depending on the state where we serve customers, 
provide options for how the company can continue to 
serve customers and communities. 

The filings consider forecasts of potential future 
climate policies, future electricity demand, fuel 
prices, transmission improvements, new generating 
capacity and technologies, integration of renewables, 
energy storage, energy efficiency and demand 
response initiatives.

61   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

We are also taking a closer look at climate-related 
physical risks and the potential vulnerability of the 
company’s assets to future climate change impacts. 

In the Carolinas, as part of a settlement agreement 
approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, 
the company has engaged world-class experts to 
develop a robust set of utility-relevant climate change 
projections to better understand the range of potential 
climate change impacts on the company’s transmission 
and distribution system. 

The company is also working with more than 35 
stakeholder groups in this Carolinas process to create 
meaningful opportunities for stakeholder input and to 
gather consensus around future steps. 

Supply Chain Governance

Our supply chain sustainability strategy enables us to 
reduce carbon emissions in our supply chain, promote 
economic development and build diversity among our 
supply base. As we chart the path toward net-zero 
carbon emissions, our supply chain environmental 
programs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
preserve natural resources. 

We also created more efficiencies in trucking and 
logistics. During 2021, the company coordinated 129 
backhaul pickups, saving over 12,000 miles traveled. 
And by using telematics, we reduced the amount 
of time our trucks operated in idle mode by 8%, 
preventing 90 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. 

We promote economic development and support 
our communities through various aspects of our 
operations, including investment with suppliers, vendors 
and contractors. In 2021, we spent approximately 
$11.5 billion purchasing goods and services to provide 
electricity and natural gas to our customers. 

Adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct is a 
condition of doing business with the company and 
describes in detail our expectations of suppliers. We 
have a strong Human Rights Policy, and we expect 
our suppliers to adhere to these same principles and 
support fair labor practices for all workers involved in 
supply chains. These policy principles are reflected in 
contractual requirements to our suppliers through the 
Supplier Code of Conduct and suppliers are to report 
any violations by any party to Duke Energy. In addition, 
we closely monitor our supply chain and have begun to 
ask manufacturers to demonstrate their products do not 
contain materials from areas using forced labor.

In 2021, we diverted more than 87,700 tons of solid 
waste through recycling and beneficial reuse. This 
includes over 90% of old power poles, pallets, reels 
and other wood. The company also remanufactured and 
repaired 22% of its scrap transformers, significantly 
reducing the need to purchase new equipment and 
the use of oil and metals such as copper, aluminum 
and steel.

Another way we are helping support economic 
development is through Hire North Carolina, an 
innovative program that aligns with our supply chain 
sustainability strategy. Through the program, which is 
directed and overseen by the North Carolinas Utilities 
Commission, we added 136 suppliers to our Hire 
North Carolina list of qualified resident contractors, 
expanding the local contracting source pool for high

value work taking place within the state. During 2021, 
Duke Energy awarded $224 million with resident 
contractors through 23 contracts, nine of which were 
awarded to diverse businesses. 

We improve the vitality of our communities by 
consistently considering local economic impact, 
diversity and environmental stewardship in our sourcing 
selection process. In 2021, Duke Energy spent more 
than $4 billion with local suppliers. Spending with 
diverse suppliers exceeded $1.5 billion, with nearly 
40% of the spending from subcontracting by our 
prime contractors.

Through the collaborative efforts of internal customers, 
prime contractors and our supply chain department, we 
have spent more than $1 billion annually with diverse 
suppliers for seven consecutive years. 

Local, regional and national outreach efforts with 
educational institutions, trade associations, community 
economic development organizations and others raise 
awareness of opportunities to work with Duke Energy. 

In 2021, the company introduced an inaugural 
Supplier Diversity University, a two-day educational 
event focused on enhancing existing diverse supplier 
relationships and developing new ones. 

As a testament to our commitment to local and 
diverse suppliers, we earned two Supplier Diversity 
Advocate of the Year Awards, one from the Florida 
State Minority Supplier Development Council and the 
other by the National Association of Women Business 
Owners Orlando Chapter. These honors acknowledge 
our dedication to the continued growth of our supplier 
diversity program.

Diversity in Clean Energy (DiCE) 

DiCE is a coalition sponsored by Duke Energy’s 
Sustainable Solutions team working 
collaboratively with T-Mobile, Microsoft, Kroger 
and three diverse suppliers. The collaborative 
has partnered with the American Association 
of Blacks in Energy to create a first-of-its-kind 
diverse supplier platform.

DiCE’s goal is to advance the voice of diverse 
suppliers by using existing relationships, 
influence and advocacy to raise awareness, 
open doors and amplify the voices of 
diverse supplies.

To make it easier to locate diverse suppliers in 
the clean energy industry, the DiCE’s platform 
will go live in the third quarter of 2022. In 
addition, the coalition is working to form other 
partnerships with energy-based entities.

The ultimate goal is to have diverse 
suppliers in clean energy incorporated into 
mainstream corporate supply chains and 
to destroy systemic barriers, which exclude 
them from competing with larger, non-
diverse counterparts.

DiCE is good for business – it can enable 
companies to meet diverse supplier goals and 
promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

DiCE is good for society – it helps to create 
vibrant economies by supporting diverse 
suppliers in local communities.

We look forward to creating a diverse and 
equitable future for our customers, suppliers 
and communities.

 1  This amount includes the $937,075 federal lobbying portion of trade association dues (includes dues in excess of $50,000 during the half-year periods in which they were reported) to support policy 

research and advocacy. 

Political Involvement 

A necessary component of our clean energy 
transformation will be to partner with stakeholders and 
champion durable public policies at the local, state and 
federal levels that enable us to transition our generating 
fleet, expand and adapt our electric grid, and adopt 
new carbon-free technologies that will reduce emissions 
while keeping energy affordable and reliable. It is 
essential for us to engage in public policy discussions to 
advocate for the interests of our stakeholders.

Policy Engagement

2021 was a momentous year for policy issues affiliated 
with climate and sustainability. We engaged in 
discussions at international, national and regional levels. 
A few examples include:

 ■ Participated in events affiliated with COP26 in 

Glasgow, Scotland, to share our perspective on the 
clean energy transition and our net zero ambition.

 ■ Signed a letter organized by the Center for Climate 
and Energy Solutions (C2ES) and sent to Speaker 
of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority 
Leader Chuck Schumer to encourage them to enact 
the climate and clean energy provisions of the Build 
Back Better framework.

 ■ Supported the direct regulation of methane emissions 

under the Clean Air Act.

 ■ Worked to advance clean energy tax credits in the 
Clean Energy for America Act and the Build Back 
Better Act.

 ■ Participated in a utility roundtable at the White 
House, led by Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 
President Tom Kuhn and several top energy 
company leaders voicing support for clean energy 

tax provisions that are crafted to provide accelerated 
customer benefits like lower power bills and 
cleaner energy.

 ■ Elevated policies to benefit underserved customers, 
specifically supporting Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program (LIHEAP) action day. 

 ■ Participated in a White House Cybersecurity  

Summit and strengthened our security partnerships 
to provide resilient service for our customers 
and communities.

 ■ Added our voice to a video series produced by the 

Business Roundtable to address climate change and 
call for policies to support the rapid development and 
deployment of cleaner technologies.

Political Giving 

The Corporate Governance Committee regularly 
reviews the company’s political expenditures, as well 
the processes and priorities related to those political 
expenditures. Additionally, the Corporate Governance 
Committee also reviews the feedback from shareholders 
regarding our political expenditures and the alignment 
of our lobbying practices with our climate goals. In 
response to this feedback, in 2021, we:

 ■ Updated our Political Expenditures Policy to provide 
additional disclosures, beginning with the Corporate 
Political Expenditures Report for the first half of 
2022 regarding certain contributions and dues 
to 501(c)(4)s and 501(c)(6)s, as described in the 
Political Expenditures Policy.

 ■ Published our first Trade Association Climate Review, 
which was one of the first such disclosures in our 
industry and discusses the alignment of our climate 
position with major federal trade associations. We 
updated the report in April 2022.

64   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Ethics and Compliance

Duke Energy’s Ethics and Compliance Program is 
designed to foster a culture of ethical and compliant 
behavior. This includes adhering to our ethics codes for 
directors, employees and suppliers, and living our values 
of safety, integrity and service. The Audit Committee of 
the Board of Directors exercises important oversight for 
the effectiveness of the program. 

New employees are required to complete ethics and 
compliance training in their first 30 days on the job and 
refresher training is required annually for all employees. 
All employees also are required to acknowledge 
annually their responsibility to comply with company 
ethics policies and confirm their obligation to report 
violations of laws, rules, or company policies. 

In 2021, we also revamped our Supplier Code training, 
so suppliers better understand their ethical obligations 
when engaging with Duke Energy. We also put an 
upgraded data analytics program in place to explore 
the effectiveness of training and assess the learner’s 
knowledge retention. 

In addition to training, we continuously review policies 
and strengthen controls and oversight to improve 
performance and accountability. For example, we 
implemented enhanced due diligence in 2021 for 

political contributions and engagement of external 
political consultants and lobbyists. 

We continue to be vigilant to address the varying 
ethical and security risks associated with a work-from-
home environment for many of our employees. Among 
other steps, our Chief Executive Officer frequently 
communicated to the workforce through videos and 
fireside chats the company’s expectations to adhere 
to the CDC guidelines to keep our workforce and 
customers healthy and safe. 

Workers are encouraged to report suspected 
wrongdoing and may do so anonymously without 
fear of reprisal through an independent third party, 
which provides a 24-hour telephone line and an online 
reporting option. All allegations are investigated to 
ensure fair and consistent treatment, and retaliation is 
strictly prohibited. We expect company leadership to 
frequently discuss ethical issues with employees. 

In 2021, we received 1.92 reports per 100 employees 
of breaches of our ethics codes compared to our 
benchmark median of 1.7. Of those, 34% were 
substantiated resulting in corrective action. Corrective 
action includes but is not limited to discipline up to 
and including termination of employment, process and 
internal control reviews, policy improvements, and 
communication to reinforce expectations. 

65   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

Cybersecurity

As one of the nation’s largest grid operators and 
operators of designated critical natural gas pipelines, we 
know assets and information are critical to deliver the 
essential service customers and communities rely on. 
Maintaining a steadfast and sophisticated cybersecurity 
operation is a vital part of that responsibility. 

Cybersecurity remains a critical issue for our industry 
and nation. And in 2021, international tensions put a 
spotlight on the need for a strong cybersecurity posture 
for critical infrastructure. Threat actors continue to 
develop more frequent and sophisticated attacks, 
even exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We have a highly skilled, cross-functional team of 
cybersecurity and physical security professionals 
devoted to identifying and mitigating these threats 
24 hours a day. The cybersecurity team collects 
millions of data points every day and distills the threat 
data into actionable alerts. In 2021 alone, cybersecurity 
analysts at Duke Energy conducted hands-on 
investigations of nearly 33,000 alerts. 

To stay ahead of threats, we use a proactive strategy 
focused on robust cybersecurity standards, a 
multilayered defense, and partnerships and information 
sharing. The electric, nuclear power, and natural gas 
sectors are subject to a range of mandatory regulations 
and security directives, as well as cybersecurity 

standards and voluntary guidelines. And as we 
further modernize our grid and accelerate digital 
transformation across the company, we continue to 
implement advanced security measures for operational 
technology at our substations, power plants, and new 
grid mechanisms.

We regularly communicate and coordinate with peer 
utilities, industry partners, security organizations, and 
government agencies – including the Department of 
Homeland Security and the FBI – to share intelligence 
and best practices. In preparation to respond to threats, 
we hold drills several times a year to test incident 
response plans and ensure employees understand their 
roles in an event. We also participate in external drills 
that include members of management and, at times, 
our Board of Directors, that help coordinate with other 
critical infrastructure. 

The company also maintains a team dedicated to 
educating employees and building their awareness 
around threats – employing annual cyber responsibility 
trainings, sending routine phishing emails and creating 
seminars and video resources that can be used by every 
level and division of the company. 

The Audit Committee receives updates on cybersecurity 
and reviews metrics and trends at every regularly 
scheduled meeting and discusses ESG disclosures, 
processes, and disclosure frameworks.

STATEMENT REGARDING RENEWABLE 
ENERGY CERTIFICATES

Duke Energy’s subsidiary electric utilities generate 
power from solar, hydroelectric and biomass (including 
waste to energy) resources, but do not always retain the 
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) related to such 
generation. The RECs associated with such generation 
may be used to meet statutory or regulatory compliance 
obligations (on behalf of the respective electric utility and 
certain wholesale customers), assigned to customers 
pursuant to retail programs or sold/traded via bilateral 
commercial agreements. Duke Energy’s electric utilities 
also buy power through purchased power agreements 
(PPAs) from solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass 
(including waste to energy) resources. Under certain 
PPAs for energy from such resources, the electric utilities 

purchase both the energy and the associated RECs. 
Under other PPAs, including some of those entered into 
pursuant to the electric utilities’ respective obligations 
under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 
(PURPA), Duke Energy does not purchase any RECs 
associated with the energy. Under PPAs entered into 
by Duke Energy’s electric utilities pursuant to certain 
retail customer programs, such utilities purchase RECs 
associated with the energy, but conveys the RECs to 
participating customers, or retires such RECs on the 
customers’ behalf. Duke Energy’s subsidiary Duke Energy 
Renewables sells the electricity and/or RECs it generates 
to its customers.

68   2021 DUKE ENERGY ESG REPORT

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Non-GAAP Measures 

Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS)

Duke Energy’s 2021 ESG Report references adjusted EPS for the year-to-
date periods ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $5.24, $5.12 and 
$5.06, respectively.

The non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EPS, represents basic EPS available to 
Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP reported EPS), adjusted for 
the per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items represent 
certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of 
Duke Energy’s ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation 
of adjusted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them 
with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across 
periods. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for planning and 
forecasting and for reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of 
Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted EPS is also 
used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable 
GAAP measure for adjusted EPS is reported basic EPS available to Duke Energy 
Corporation common stockholders.

Special items included in the periods presented include the following items, which 
management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

Workplace and Workforce Realignment represents costs attributable to 
business transformation, including long-term real estate strategy changes 
and workforce realignment.
Regulatory Settlements represents an impairment charge related to the 
South Carolina Supreme Court decision on coal ash, insurance proceeds and 
Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress coal ash settlement and 
the partial settlements in the 2019 North Carolina rate cases.
Gas Pipeline Investments represents costs related to the cancellation of the 
ACP investment and additional exit obligations.
Severance represents the reversal of 2018 Severance charges, which were 
deferred as a result of a partial settlement in the Duke Energy Carolinas and 
Duke Energy Progress 2019 North Carolina rate cases.
Impairment Charges represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at 
Citrus County CC and an other-than-temporary impairment on the remaining 
investment in Constitution. 

Duke Energy’s adjusted EPS may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure 
of another company because other entities may not calculate the measure in the 
same manner.

The following is a reconciliation of reported EPS to adjusted EPS for 2021, 2020 
and 2019:

Duke Energy’s 2021 ESG Report references Duke Energy’s forecasted 2022 
adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 per share. The materials also 
reference the forecasted 2022 adjusted EPS midpoint of approximately $5.45. In 
addition, the materials reference the long-term range of annual growth of 5% to 
7% through 2026 off the midpoint of original 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range 
of $5.15. The forecasted adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure as it 
represents basic EPS available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders 
(GAAP reported EPS), adjusted for the per share impact of special items (as 
discussed under Adjusted EPS). Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-
GAAP financial measure for future periods, information to reconcile it to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as 
management is unable to project all special items for future periods, such as legal 
settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments.

Dividend Payout Ratio

The materials for Duke Energy’s ESG Report include a discussion of Duke Energy’s 
long-term target dividend payout ratio of 65% to 75% based upon adjusted EPS. 
This payout ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure as it is based upon forecasted 
basic EPS from continuing operations available to Duke Energy Corporation 
stockholders, adjusted for the per share impact of special items, as discussed 
above under Adjusted EPS. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for 
adjusted EPS is reported basic EPS available to Duke Energy Corporation common 
stockholders. Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial 
measure for future periods, information to reconcile it to the most directly 
comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management 
is unable to project all special items, as discussed above under Adjusted 
EPS Guidance.
