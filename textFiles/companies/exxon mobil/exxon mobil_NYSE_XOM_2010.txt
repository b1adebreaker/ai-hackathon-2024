2010 Corporate Citizenship Report

about this report

ExxonMobil’s 2010 Corporate Citizenship 
Report details our environmental, social, 
and governance performance. The report 
continues our annual practice of reporting 
on both our achievements and areas for 
improvement as we work to deliver energy 
to meet growing world needs. 

Reporting standards
This report was produced in accordance 
with the reporting guidelines and indicators 
of the International Petroleum Industry 
Environmental Conservation Association 
(IPIECA) and the American Petroleum 
Institute (API) Oil and Gas Industry 
Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability 
Reporting (April 2005). In December 2010, 
our involvement in a three-year, industry-
wide process to update the Guidance 
concluded with the publication of a new 
guide. We plan to report in accordance 
with the updated Guidance beginning 
in reporting year 2011. The Guidance is 
intended to facilitate the comparison of 
nonfinancial reporting across companies, 
help companies engage stakeholders, drive 
performance, and promote understanding 
of sustainability issues.

The majority of these indicators are also 
consistent with the indicators used by the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in the  
G3 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 
(see our IPIECA/GRI index on page 48).

Scope of the report
The report covers ExxonMobil’s operations 
as of December 31, 2010, unless otherwise 
indicated. Both qualitative descriptions and 
quantitative metrics are used to explain 
our policies, programs, and practices. For 
environmental performance data, the unit 
of measure is metric, unless otherwise 
labeled. Financial information is reported in 
U.S. dollars. 

Assurance
We believe third-party assurance of our 
report provides an objective evaluation of 
how well we report our citizenship informa-
tion and gives our reporting processes 
additional credibility. Lloyd’s Register Quality 
Assurance, Inc. (LRQA) conducts annual 
third-party assurance of the ExxonMobil 
reporting system. For the full assurance 
statement, see the inside back cover.

ExxonMobil reports greenhouse gas 
emissions on an equity basis for all our 
business operations, reflecting our percent 
ownership in an asset. Environmental, 
safety, and health data are reported for 
those operations under direct ExxonMobil 
management and operational control. In 
2010, ExxonMobil acquired XTO Energy Inc. 
(see pages 10, 16, and 30). XTO’s integra-
tion is discussed in general terms, but 
specific sustainability performance data 
will not be presented until integration has 
been completed. Exxon Mobil Corporation 
has numerous affiliates, with many names 
that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Mobil, and 
Esso. For convenience and simplicity, those 
terms, and terms such as Corporation, 
company, our, we, us, and its, are some-
times used as abbreviated references to 
specific affiliates or affiliate groups.

Feedback
External feedback on our report is a key 
component of our continuous improve-
ment strategy. Comments are reviewed 
by management and, in many instances, 
incorporated into the report. We solicit 
feedback and identify information gaps, 
strengths, and weaknesses through a 
variety of mechanisms, including our Web 
site, interviews with employees, opinion 
leaders from nongovernmental organiza-
tions, academia, socially responsible or 
sustainable investment firms, industry 
analysts, and our External Citizenship 
Advisory Panel (see page 9). For addi-
tional information, to view previous

Materiality analysis

Our materiality analysis process identi-
fies economic, environmental, and social 
issues that are of particular interest and 
concern to both our stakeholders and 
business operations. Material issues may 
have a significant current or future impact 
on our company and may expand beyond 
financial reporting or regulatory issues. 
We identify issues of external significance 
by monitoring stakeholder expectations 
and concerns through direct dialogue, 
public debate, legislation, international 
agreements, and feedback on our report. 
To further evaluate issues of global signifi-
cance, we look to international reporting 
standards and expectations, such as the 
United Nations Global Compact and the 
Millennium Development Goals.

Priority issues are determined by using a 
three-tiered review system that rates each 
issue based on its level of significance to 
different stakeholder groups as well as its 
cumulative business impact. This analysis 
allows us to monitor recurring issues and 
to identify emerging issues. 

The results of the analysis are reviewed by 
ExxonMobil senior management and are 
used to build the content of our report. 
The process promotes internal under-
standing of corporate citizenship and 
sustainability issues and helps to shape 
our strategies and objectives. In this 
report, we discuss those material issues 
within the context of ExxonMobil opera-
tions. For additional information, see our 
Web site (exxonmobil.com/analysis).

Letter from the Chairman and CEO

rex w. tiLLerson, chairMan and ceo

“Without leadership by example and 
without thoughtful, honest, and objective  
self-assessment, no system is sustainable.”

Statement to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling,  
November 9, 2010 

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     3

Welcome to the 2010 Corporate Citizenship Report

This past year, everyone with an interest in the energy industry—and in corporate citizenship more generally—
was reminded of the critical importance of corporate accountability and responsibility. 

The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico last summer shook our industry and the confidence of 
many of our stakeholders. After 14,000 deepwater wells drilled successfully around the world, this isolated incident 
caused many to ask fundamental questions about what it means to be a good corporate citizen in the energy 
industry. The incident was a painful reminder about the importance of integrity and responsible operations.

As you will read in this report, ExxonMobil remains committed to a systematic and unwavering focus on  
corporate responsibility at all levels. Our own experience after the Exxon Valdez oil spill fundamentally shaped 
the way our company understands and manages risk. It motivated us to recommit ourselves—that safety, 
operational excellence, environmental protection, financial discipline, and ethical standards must be a part  
of our business each and every day. 

This year’s Corporate Citizenship Report details our systematic approach to managing our global operations, 
and the measures we employ to successfully operate in a variety of environments. It describes how we address 
the challenges of developing energy resources—and supplying that energy to world markets while delivering  
a return to our shareholders. 

There is no question that this requires the constant management of risk. The sustainability of our business 
is based on our ability to apply consistent processes and systems in our daily operations to ensure that risk 
is identified, planned for, and successfully managed. We recognize that embedding the highest standards of 
safety, environmental performance, ethics, economic stewardship, and community engagement in every aspect  
of our activities is critical to protecting local communities and supporting our company’s long-term success. 

It is also critical to meeting the shared challenge that the world faces: how to provide the energy required for eco-
nomic growth and improved standards of living while protecting the environment. This challenge is acute because 
oil and natural gas reserves are often located in remote and sensitive regions. To develop these resources while 
respecting the local environments and communities in which they are found, we must employ the highest indus-
try safety, environmental, and social standards. For example, our project in Papua New Guinea traverses areas 
requiring careful environmental and cultural planning. As you will read in this report, we are conducting social and 
environmental surveys in that country and are adapting our project activities accordingly.

To meet growing global energy demand, society will increasingly rely upon new ways to produce resources. 
One example is Canada’s oil sands—the second largest oil reserves in the world. Investments in the devel-
opment and deployment of improved technologies for extraction and transport of this valuable resource are 
critical. And when done successfully, these technologies can minimize impacts to the environment. Natural gas 
is another example. Vast amounts of natural gas are located in shale formations around the world. By combining 
technology with operational excellence, we can safely unlock these supplies for the benefit of this generation 
and the next. We recognize that there are multiple viewpoints on the appropriate production and use of these 
resources—as there are with all energy sources—and we are committed to constructive engagement with our 
stakeholders on these issues. 

2010 was a year of significant challenge for the energy industry. We know that the confidence of stakeholders is 
critical to the industry’s ability to operate and to be successful. From ExxonMobil’s perspective, we are committed 
to maintaining this confidence by continuing to operate safely, responsibly, and in a manner that promotes the 
long-term economic, environmental, and social health of our communities.

We hope you find our 2010 Corporate Citizenship Report useful in understanding how ExxonMobil addresses 
challenges in these important areas. We welcome your comments.

Sustainability

Our world faces a major challenge: meeting rising global energy demand—which lifts people out of 
poverty and improves living standards—while addressing the environmental impacts that come with 
energy use. It is this challenge that lies at the heart of discussions about sustainability and the energy 
industry. Without energy, there can simply be no improvement in the quality of life of the world’s citizens. 

ExxonMobil is committed to addressing the challenge of sustainability—balancing economic growth, 
social development, and environmental protection so future generations are not compromised by actions 
taken today. We take our commitments in these areas very seriously; they are critical to our ability to do 
our job well, every day.

Downstre a m

In this report, we articulate how we address 
the challenge of sustainability through six 
focus areas: Safety, Health, and the Workplace  
(page 12); Corporate Governance (page 20); 
Environmental Performance (page 24); Managing 
Climate Change Risks (page 32); Economic 
Development (page 38); and Community 
Engagement and Human Rights (page 44). 

These focus areas span the length and breadth 
of our business, and we recognize the critical 
importance of continuous improvement and 
excellence in each area.

We work in sensitive environmental and 
social locations to find and produce new 
sources of energy. Many of our refining 
facilities are located close to homes and 
businesses. We supply essential chemical 
products to make other industries—such as 
modern computing, medical supplies, and 
automobiles—possible. In all such activi-
ties—and in the many others, which together 
comprise our business—a constant focus on 
sustainability is critical to our success.

And, given the events of 2010 in the Gulf of 
Mexico, we are reminded of the fundamental 
importance of operations integrity. Without a 
commitment to responsible operations and 
careful planning in all activities, the energy 
industry cannot lay claim to being sustainable. 

It is the goal of this report to outline for 
stakeholders how ExxonMobil puts our com-
mitment to sustainability into practice every 
day. We invite comment and dialogue on this 
important area from all who take an interest in 
our company and our industry.

The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030

The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030, our long-term forecast of supply and demand trends, projects 
global energy demand in 2030 to be about 35 percent higher than it was in 2005—even with substantial 
gains in efficiency. Meeting this rising demand for energy in a safe and environmentally responsible way 
is ExxonMobil’s mission and is a key challenge facing governments and societies worldwide. The scale 
and nature of this challenge is described in the Outlook, which we use to help guide our investment 
decisions. We also share it publicly to encourage broader understanding of energy issues.

Doha, Qatar. Many of the hallmarks of human progress—the improvements in how people live, work, and stay safe and healthy—are enabled by energy. As societies 
and technologies develop, people’s energy usage will continue to evolve.

Population and economic 
growth drive demand 
Population growth continues to be a key 
factor behind rising energy demand. Today, 
the world’s population is approaching  
7 billion, but as personal incomes grow, 
population expansion will slow—a trend 
emerging in the last decade. By 2030, the 
global population will reach about 8 billion. 

Other major influences on energy demand 
include economic growth and increasing 
prosperity. From 2005 to 2030, the global 
economy will expand at an average rate 
of 2.8 percent per year, but growth will be 
fastest in Non-OECD1 countries. By 2030, 
demand in these nations will rise by more 
than 70 percent, led by China and India, 
while energy demand in OECD countries  
will remain essentially flat as efficiency 
gains help offset demand growth.

Energy-related CO2 emissions 
growth moderates 
Meeting the world’s energy challenges goes 
beyond balancing supply and demand; it also 

requires managing the risks posed by rising 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We project 
global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions will increase about 25 percent 
from 2005 to 2030. Although substantial, this 
increase is significantly lower than the pro-
jected 35-percent growth in energy demand, 
reflecting expected efficiency gains and a shift 
toward less carbon-intensive energies over 
time. Globally, we anticipate efficiency gains 
will not only curb global energy demand growth 
by almost 65 percent through 2030, but also 
contribute significantly to offsetting 75 percent 
of the potential growth in CO2 emissions.

In OECD countries, CO2 emissions will 
decline through 2030 even as economic 
output grows by more than 60 percent and 
population grows by 10 percent. This shift 
will be spurred in part by government policies 
designed to reduce emissions by impos-
ing a cost on CO2. For the purposes of the 
Outlook, ExxonMobil anticipates that by 2020, 
adoption of these policies will be equivalent to 
adding CO2 costs of about $30 per metric ton 
in OECD countries, rising to $60 per metric 
ton by 2030. At these levels, natural gas and 

other lower-carbon energy sources become 
increasingly cost competitive, particularly in 
the power generation sector. 

Non-OECD countries will see gains in energy 
efficiency and increase their share of cleaner 
fuels, but the resulting CO2 savings are more 
than offset by the tremendous rise in energy 
demand needed to fuel rapid economic 
development. By 2030, these nations will 
account for approximately two-thirds of 
energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide.

Diverse mix of reliable, affordable 
energy sources required 
With the scale of the world’s energy needs 
already enormous, it is clear that a mix 
of reliable, affordable energy sources 
must continue to be developed in order to 
provide the energy needed for economic 
growth and societal development. As new 
technologies advance, our energy sources 
evolve—growing cleaner and more diverse. 
Through 2030, there will be significant shifts 
in the composition of the world’s energy, but 
oil, natural gas, and coal are projected to 
remain the most significant energy sources. 

1Dividing the world’s nations into two groups—according to membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)—is useful for studying energy trends. This is because the 
more than 30 members of the OECD—including Australia, most of Europe, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United States—generally have more mature economies and well-developed patterns of 
energy use. Non-OECD countries will have different energy-use patterns because their economies are rapidly advancing.

By 2030, they will provide just under  
80 percent of global energy, down slightly 
versus today. Nuclear, along with wind, solar, 
and biofuels, is projected to grow rapidly, sup-
plying about 8 percent and 3 percent of the 
world’s energy needs in 2030, respectively.

Liquid supplies diversify 
By 2030, total liquids demand is expected 
to reach slightly more than 100 million oil-
equivalent barrels per day. Because of their 
high energy density, availability, and con-
venience, liquid fuels will continue to be the 
fuel of choice for transportation—the sector 
responsible for about 85 percent of projected 
liquids demand growth.

Resources requiring advanced technologies 
to unlock supplies that exist in geographically 
challenging locations or that require more 
complex extraction technologies will play an 
increasing role in meeting liquids demand. 
By 2030, deepwater and oil sands resources 
will likely contribute close to 20 percent of 
worldwide liquids supply, while natural gas 
liquids will contribute an additional 10 percent. 

Natural gas adapts to  
growing needs 
Natural gas is expected to be the fastest- 
growing major fuel source through 2030, with 
its share of global energy rising from about  
20 percent to about 25 percent, displacing 
coal as the second most prominent source of 
energy worldwide (see case study, page 30). 
This rapid expansion of natural gas demand 
through 2030 reflects several important factors. 
One is a steep rise in Non-OECD demand in 
the residential, commercial, industrial, and 
power generation sectors. The second is a shift 
away from coal for power generation in order to 
reduce CO2 emissions in OECD countries. 

Given its abundance, affordability, dependabil-
ity, and properties as a cleaner-burning fuel, 
expanded use of natural gas can help meet 
growing demand while enabling advancement 
of environmental goals worldwide.

Taking on the world’s toughest 
energy challenges 
Supplying reliable, affordable energy in a 
safe and environmentally sound manner is 
critical to enabling advancement and pros-
perity. Meeting growing demand will require 
an integrated set of solutions to expand all 
economic energy sources, accelerate gains 
in efficiency, reduce energy-related CO2 
emissions, and develop new energy tech-
nologies. To provide solutions at the scale 
embodied in the Outlook, the world will need 
tremendous levels of investment sustained 
over decades; an unwavering drive for

Engagement

Like most energy providers, we operate at the center of challenging issues that require transparency 
and responsiveness. Our increasingly diverse group of stakeholders includes governments, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), communities, shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, 
and others. External engagement is fundamental to how we conduct our business. 

Ongoing dialogue and engagement with our 
stakeholders provide opportunities to listen 
to concerns, identify material issues, and 
benchmark performance against expecta-
tions. We focus our engagement efforts 
primarily on groups and individuals directly 
impacted by, or who have a direct impact on, 
our operations. 

Our engagement takes many forms, including 
internal and external one-on-one and group 
dialogues and briefings; senior executive 
speeches; quarterly earnings teleconferences; 
focus groups; community consultations; 
e-mail communications; publications, such

Oil spill response

In April 2010, the oil spill in the Gulf of 
Mexico highlighted the importance of 
effective emergency response practices. 
ExxonMobil engaged with policymakers 
and industry leaders to address capabili-
ties in oil spill prevention and emergency 
response. Through joint industry task 
forces, congressional briefings, and 
multiple consultations with the National 
Commission on the BP Deepwater 
Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling 
and the U.S. Departments of Interior 
and Energy, we supplied input into the 
response mechanisms and future policy 
development. For information about 
our participation in the development of 
a marine well containment system, see

It can be challenging to address certain 
stakeholder issues that directly conflict with 
our business practices. Additionally, it is 
not uncommon for us to encounter oppos-
ing stakeholder views. For example, many 
diverse viewpoints exist surrounding shale 
gas development using hydraulic fracturing 
(see page 30). We listen to all perspectives 
on the energy debate and consider these 
discussions in long-term planning.

The Esso refinery and chemical facility  
at Fawley is the largest in the United 
Kingdom. Each year, employees at Fawley 
volunteer to participate in local community 
projects. To further engage the community 
and promote understanding of operations 
at the facility, guided tours are offered to 
local residents. Each tour provides visi-
tors with an introductory presentation of 
Fawley operations, including a detailed 
overview of safety, in which visitors learn 
about the site’s safety performance as well 
as community emergency response pro-
cedures. In 2010, more than 500 residents 
toured the facility, responding positively 
to seeing firsthand the level of security, 
environmental controls, and safety pro-
cedures implemented at the site.

In 2010, we held approximately 35 meet-
ings and teleconferences with institutional 
investors and socially responsible 
investors on issues, including oil sands 
development, shale gas development, 
and executive compensation. One of 
our institutional investors, the American 
Federation of Labor and Congress of 
Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), sug-
gested we adopt principles for climate 
change action. We conducted several 
calls with the AFL-CIO and concluded 
that our approach to climate action is 
consistent with their principles. The 
proposal was withdrawn following our 
agreement to aggregate and post our 
views and principles to manage long-term 
risks from climate change in one location  
on our Web site (exxonmobil.com/climate).

external citizenship advisory panel 

In 2009, we established our first External 
Assessment Panel (EAP) to provide an 
independent review of ExxonMobil’s corpo-
rate citizenship public reporting, including 
the materiality analysis process, content, 
clarity, and relevance. The panel’s com-
ments on both the 2008 and 2009 Corporate 
Citizenship Reports have been used to 
enhance our external reporting. 

As part of ExxonMobil’s commitment to 
continuous improvement, we are adjusting 
the focus of external feedback to include 
ongoing dialogue on citizenship practices, 
rather than focusing solely on the develop-
ment of the Corporate Citizenship Report. 
In 2011, we will establish an External 
Citizenship Advisory Panel (ECAP), in place 
of the previous EAP, to provide feedback on 
the development of ExxonMobil’s citizenship 
activities, strategy, and communications.

The ECAP consists of five members, exter-
nal to ExxonMobil, each with recognized 
expertise in environmental, social, or gover-
nance issues. Over the course of the year, 

panelists will be invited to participate in a 
range of activities and discussions relevant 
to citizenship at ExxonMobil. These include 
reviewing a draft of the 2010 Corporate 
Citizenship Report and participation in a 
tour of ExxonMobil operating facilities, which 
will provide an opportunity for firsthand 
observation of our operating standards, 
processes, and programs. Panelists will also 
convene to discuss environmental, safety, 
and social issues of external concern. 
ExxonMobil subject matter experts and 
senior management representatives will 
engage with the panelists on these issues. 

We anticipate these opportunities for  
dialogue with the ECAP will not only con-
tinue to shape our Corporate Citizenship 
Report, but will also enhance our overall 
approach to addressing stakeholder  
interest in the company’s approach to  
corporate citizenship.

EXAMPLE 
Papua New Guinea—
local supplier base

Our lubricants business provides cus-
tomers with leading-edge technology 
products. Our synthetic lubricants and 
greases are used across a wide range of 
automotive and industrial applications to 
help extend equipment life and reduce 
the number of oil changes needed. We 
continue to work with customers to 
develop sustainable product solutions. In 
2010, we redesigned our U.S. multiquart1 
packaging to incorporate sustainability 
considerations from both our custom-
ers’ and ExxonMobil’s standpoints. The 
new packaging reduces plastic resin 
consumption by up to 7 percent. The 
redesigned bottles and cartons also 
allow more cases per pallet, improving 
transportation efficiency and optimizing 
retailers’ shelf-space utilization.

In April 2010, the Papua New Guinea 
project opened a resource center to help 
local companies strengthen their man-
agement skills (see page 42). More than 
4900 Papua New Guinean businesspeople 
received information about the project 
and more than 1000 businesses regis-
tered with the supplier database. This 
database provides access to domestic 
company profiles, business assessment 
summaries, domestic business-to-business 
opportunities, and center events. We 
have allocated more than $1 million 
to the center to support local supplier 
registration, assessment, training, and 
communication events. The project has 
invested more than $550 million in Papua 
New Guinean service contracts for the 
supply of goods and services.

leadership and safety 
program

At ExxonMobil, safety is a core value. In 
2009, ExxonMobil Australia launched a 
program to enhance leadership behavior 
and improve the safety culture at our 
Gippsland operations. Approximately 
95 percent of the workforce responded 
to a safety culture survey and identified 
improvement opportunities. In response to 
feedback, in 2010, the Production Company 
delivered the ExxonMobil Fundamentals 
of Safety course to 600 employees and 
contractors. Participants in this two-and-
a-half-day program learned best practices 
in safety leadership and developed safety 
improvement plans. Employees who 
completed the training demonstrated 
improved behavior and a commitment to 
positively influence safety.

Performance Data

Efficiently collecting and managing data related to our six citizenship focus areas and the overall 
financial health of the Corporation is essential to measure performance. To ensure that the citizen-
ship data provided in our performance data table and elsewhere in this report are relevant, we 
selected indicators based on guidance provided by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental 
Conservation Association (IPIECA) and cross-referenced the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

Long-term financial resource 
management
ExxonMobil’s responsibility is to provide 
competitively priced energy supplies to our 
customers while delivering value to our share-
holders. Because the investments we make 
today can impact our financial performance 
for decades, we utilize a disciplined approach 
to pursue and select the most attractive 
investment opportunities. In 2010, we contin-
ued investing at record levels—more than  
$32 billion in capital and exploration expen-
ditures for the year—and we expect to invest 
more than $165 billion over the next five years. 

creating shareholder value. We seek to 
deliver superior shareholder value through 
disciplined capital investments, operational 
excellence, and the maintenance of a long-
term industry perspective. We expect this 
approach to translate into strong earnings and 
cash flows throughout the business cycle, 
which provides the basis for business invest-
ments and distributions to shareholders. 

Approximately 2.5 million individual sharehold-
ers own about 50 percent of ExxonMobil’s 
common stock. The remaining 50 percent 

of shares are owned by institutions, includ-
ing those that manage mutual funds and 
pension funds. For more than 100 years, 
the Corporation has paid dividends. In 2010, 
shareholder distributions from dividend pay-
ments and net share purchases totaled more 
than $20 billion. Annual dividend payments 
per share have increased for 28 consecutive 
years—by 5 percent in 2010 and 53 percent 
over the last five years.

reserves replacement. At year-end 2010, 
ExxonMobil had proved reserves totaling 
nearly 25 billion oil-equivalent barrels or 
nearly 15 years of reserves life at current 
production levels. In 2010, we replaced  
209 percent of production including property 
sales and 211 percent excluding property 
sales. Our five-year average replacement ratio 
was 131 percent. We have replaced more 
than 100 percent of production for 17 consec-
utive years, as determined on ExxonMobil’s 
basis, reflecting our strategic focus on 
resource capture and a disciplined approach 
to investment and project execution.

taxes. In 2010, ExxonMobil’s worldwide 
tax expenses amounted to more than $89 
billion, about three times our earnings in the 
same period. In 2010, our worldwide effective 
income tax rate was 45 percent. 

xto energy inc.—data integration

In June 2010, ExxonMobil acquired 
XTO Energy Inc. Financial and produc-
tion data reported for 2010 include XTO 
performance. As part of the integration 
process, ExxonMobil and XTO are cur-
rently assessing XTO’s environmental, 
health, safety, human resources, and 
social data collection requirements and 
processes. Once program differences 
have been identified, we will implement 
a plan to ensure consistent data collec-
tion. XTO environmental, health, safety, 
human resources, and social data will not 
be reported until this integration process 
is complete.

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     13

Safety and operations integrity are the foundations of ExxonMobil’s business. Nothing is more important.

Safety, security, and health 
management
We hold our commitment to excellence in 
safety, security, and health in the workplace 
as a core value—one that shapes decision  
making at every level. This commitment 
is documented in our safety, health, and 
product safety policies and security expecta-
tions, which are implemented through our 
OIMS Framework (see page 18). Both con-
tractors and employees are required to follow 
these expectations as a condition of employ-
ment. In 2010, we deployed enhancements to 
the OIMS Framework, including expectations 
related to leadership, process safety, and 
assessment of OIMS effectiveness.

Personnel safety
In 2010, we once again recorded best-
ever combined employee and contractor 
workforce lost-time incident rates. We have 
reduced our workforce lost-time incident 
rate by an average of 9 percent per year 
since 2006 and 10 percent from 2009 to 
2010. A key driver in this performance 
improvement is the expectation that all 
workers take action when they observe a 
coworker who may be in an at-risk situation. 
Where applicable, our recognition programs 
reinforce this proactive engagement.

However, we are saddened to report that we 
experienced three worker fatalities in 2010. 
We thoroughly investigated the causes and 
contributing factors associated with each 
incident to learn from them and to prevent 
similar events in the future. We have also 
joined cross-industry working groups with 
representatives from oil and gas and other 
industries to better understand the precur-
sors to serious injuries and fatalities. The 

groups aim to develop a set of principles, 
criteria, and methods for more effective 
intervention to prevent serious injuries 
and fatalities.

We will not be satisfied until we achieve our 
goal of a workplace where Nobody Gets 
Hurt. It is our responsibility to ensure that 
every individual who works at one of our 
sites returns home as safe and sound as 
when he or she reported to work. 

personnel safety study. Achieving Nobody 
Gets Hurt in the workplace requires us 
to continuously assess and enhance 
our systems, programs, and practices. 
Experience has demonstrated that each 
enhancement can lead to a period of 
significant improvement, often followed by 
a plateau in performance at an improved 
incident rate. Recognizing this, we conducted 
a personnel safety study to identify new 
strategies to further improve our safety 
performance. Over the course of the study, 
the team identified two principal themes: 
the importance of leadership behavior and 
the role of performance metrics. 

In 2010, we promoted the concept of “actively 
caring” for coworkers. This further estab-
lishes an environment where workers will 
approach each other when they see potential 
hazards or unsafe behaviors, regardless of 
whether the worker is a supervisor, experi-
enced employee, or contractor. In addition, 
we are emphasizing safety leadership 
behaviors relevant to roles, workplaces, 
and organizations in training and coaching 
sessions. For example, in 2010, more than 
1000 employees and contractors partici-
pated in safety leadership workshops in the 
Development, Production, Chemical, and 
Refining and Supply Companies. 

Another emerging theme identified in the 
study is that traditional safety reporting and 
measurement based on incident rates and 
percentages alone may not always help drive 
improvement. To make safety more personal, 
we are expanding the use of a new metric, 
which captures all incidents, including first-
aid and minor incidents. By adding a personal 
element, this metric will better communicate 
the real meaning of Nobody Gets Hurt. It will 
also enhance our “reporting culture” and our 
ability to capture, analyze, and learn from 
incidents with significant potential conse-
quences, rather than just those with actual 
consequences. We aim not only to analyze 
safety incidents after they happen, but also 
to identify exposures and at-risk behaviors 
before they lead to safety incidents. 

addressing human factors. Because 
many of our employees and contractors 
work in shifts around the clock in diverse 
operations and locations, we recognize the 
important role of human factors in reducing 
workplace risks. These human factors may 
include worker fatigue, ergonomic consider-
ations, and physical and mental demands. 
Our Human Factors Technology Center 
of Excellence supports ongoing efforts to 
incorporate human factors technology into 
engineering design and construction, work-
place layout, safety systems and practices, 
and behavior-based systems. 

Incident investigation and analysis revealed 
employee awareness of potential hazards  
is often a significant contributor to the 
prevention of incidents. Our behavior-based 
safety approach, outlined in the Loss 
Prevention System, provides employees 
with consistent tools to identify and mitigate 
risks associated with specific tasks, to 

contractor safety in singapore

The Singapore Parallel Train (SPT) project 
workforce is very diverse, with employees 
and contractors hailing from 30 countries 
and speaking more than eight languages. 
To safely complete the project, we introduced 
a variety of training tools to align this large 
and diverse contractor workforce with our 
high safety standards. 

Our on-site SPT Safety Training Center 
provides an Enhanced Safety Orientation 
Course that must be completed before 
any worker gains access to the site. The 
course is conducted in eight languages 
and provides training in construction 
safety, oil and petrochemical safety, and 

basic safety standards. Since 2008, more 
than 70,000 workers have received training 
through the center.

are delivered as needed and cover such 
topics as hazard recognition and working 
at heights. 

At the existing Singapore Chemical and 
Refining manufacturing sites, we intro-
duced the Contractor Supervisor Safety 
Leadership Initiative in 2009 to train all con-
tractor supervisors in safety leadership and 
communication. In addition to site-specific 
training, a one-day Contractor Supervisor 
Safety Workshop (CSSW) is required 
to receive certification as a contractor 
supervisor. The CSSW focuses on basic 
roles and responsibilities and reinforces 
the safety mindset. Other training modules 

Since the program’s implementation in 
2009, more than 500 contractor supervisors 
have received safety training through the 
initiative. ExxonMobil safety management 
values are now widely applied by supervi-
sors, and the use of safety and equipment 
checklists for work planning and execution 
has also improved.

a culture of safety

To be fully effective and to drive sustained 
safety performance improvements, we pro-
actively develop a safety culture grounded in 
leadership at every level of the organization.

Workplaces where 
Nobody Gets Hurt

conduct self-assessments while working, 
to observe others and provide feedback on 
their behaviors (see below), and to analyze 
losses and near-losses. By identifying and 
preventing at-risk behaviors, the likelihood 
of incidents occurring or escalating can 
often be greatly reduced. In 2010, many sites 
launched efforts to further engage employ-
ees and contractors in behavior-based 
safety systems.

Process safety
Effective process safety management leads 
to the prevention of uncontrolled releases 
of hydrocarbons, chemicals, and other sub-
stances. Failure to contain these substances 
can lead to significant incidents such as fires 
and explosions, with potential for serious 
injuries and fatalities, widespread environ-
mental impacts, and property damage. Our 
process safety management framework 
focuses on reducing risks and incidents 
through OIMS, including facility design and 
operation. We continuously seek to improve 
these areas by learning from incidents and 
near-misses in our own operations and 
across our industry. We are committed to 
learning lessons from the tragic Deepwater 
Horizon incident and are working with joint 
industry task forces to develop improved 
prevention, containment, and response 
plans. In 2010, we implemented new process 
safety metrics to enhance our ability to learn 
from all levels of incidents. 

At our facilities, we focus on best practices  
in design, mechanical integrity, and 
upgrades using advanced technologies. 

In our operations, we focus on training 
employees in process safety and effective 
procedures, including best practices for our 
higher-risk activities, such as start-up and 
shut-down of operations when maintenance 
is conducted (see OIMS case study, page 19). 

Risk management and  
emergency preparedness
Risks associated with safety, security, health, 
and the environment are inherent in our 
business. ExxonMobil takes a disciplined 
approach to business continuity planning 
and emergency preparedness. Emergency 
Support Groups—comprising business lines; 
human resources; law; finance; safety, secu-
rity, health, and environment; public affairs; 
and other technical advisors—develop and 
exercise emergency response strategies. 
Emergency Response Teams are organized 
at local and regional levels to respond to 
incidents as needed.

Effective preparedness is dependent on 
training. Response team training includes 
orientation, simulations, and full exercises. 
Every site conducts emergency drills on a 
frequent basis, ranging from routine fire drills 
to full-scale exercises. In 2010, compre-
hensive drills were conducted in Angola, 
Barbados, Cameroon, Canada, Chad, 
Equatorial Guinea, Germany, Guam, and the 
United States. These drills often involve 100 
or more representatives from ExxonMobil; 
local affiliates; local, state, and federal gov-
ernments; and industry.

The day’s appointed safety observer

Each morning, the supervisor designates 
a new safety observer. Today, it was me 
so I had the job of leading the morning 
toolbox safety meeting. This morning, we 
talked about personal protective equipment 
needed for today’s work, expected hazards, 
and then we did a “step back 5x5.” That’s a 
procedure where we all talk about hazards 
and what to do about them before begin-
ning a task. Then I watched closely all day. 
I guard the safety of my friends. While they 
concentrate on work, I concentrate on their 
safety. I have the power to stop the work if 
I see something happening where I can help. 
Even though my job is pipefitter, we all learn 
all the time about safety, how we can keep 
ourselves and our team members safe.

Workplace security
At ExxonMobil, Security is Everybody’s 
Business. We provide security and safe-
guards to protect our people, facilities, 
business information, and other assets. In 
2010, we completed a multiyear, comprehen-
sive project to strengthen security at our 
facilities globally. For more information about 
security at ExxonMobil, see page 47.

Employee health
A healthy workforce benefits our business 
and the broader community. At ExxonMobil, 
we provide programs and services to help 
our employees live healthier lives. We 
incorporate workforce and community health 
considerations into project planning (see 
pages 39 and 41). 

Participation in prevention programs is key to 
maintaining a healthy workforce and respond-
ing to emerging health issues. In 2010, a 
cholera outbreak occurred in Port Moresby, 
Papua New Guinea. In response, we estab-
lished a cholera response working group to 
identify measures to prevent further spread 
of the disease. Initiatives like publishing 
prevention-related materials for employees 
and contractors, establishing a screening 
process upon camp entry, ensuring adequate 
handwashing facilities, and establishing 
cholera triage areas prevented the spread of 
cholera to project worksites. Through a part-
nership with the Salvation Army, the project 
also helped establish a community cholera 
care clinic in Port Moresby. 

workplace Malaria Control Program. 
Approximately half of the world’s population 
live in areas at risk of malaria transmission. 
ExxonMobil has established strong busi-
ness partnerships to effectively protect 
employees and contractors working in 
malaria-prone areas. Our Malaria Control 
Program comprehensively combats malaria 
through awareness, mosquito bite prevention,

preventive medication, and early diagnosis 
and treatment. Insecticide use is kept to a 
minimum to protect the health of our workers 
and to minimize environmental impacts.

commemorate the day included employee 
and contractor communications from senior 
managers, educational leaflets, souvenirs, 
and donations to local health centers. 

We track employee and contractor inci-
dences of malaria in eight countries with 
upstream operations. In 2010, 11 malaria 
cases were reported out of the thousands 
of nonimmune workers located in or visiting 
endemic areas. Approximately 98 percent of 
workers tested were compliant with preven-
tive drug regimens. To learn about our efforts 
to create healthy communities, see page 41.

employee StopAIDS. Our workplace HIV/
AIDS program, StopAIDS, combines risk 
mitigation education with access to com-
munity-based care and treatment to keep 
healthy workers disease-free and to educate 
HIV-positive workers on living safely with the 
illness. ExxonMobil does not test for HIV, and 
HIV status is not a factor in determining an 
employee’s ability to work. 

More broadly, in December 2010, ExxonMobil 
affiliates in Nigeria and Papua New Guinea 
supported World AIDS Day. Activities to 

Product stewardship and  
product safety
We actively identify and evaluate ways to miti-
gate possible effects of our products on both 
people and the environment while improving 
product performance. During the development 
of, and prior to marketing our products, we 
assess safety, health, and environmental (SHE) 
aspects as well as compliance with product 
safety legislation, both where the products are 
made and in their intended markets. Rigorous 
assessments required by government 
authorities are conducted and updated as new 
information becomes available to assure the 
safety of a new or modified product. Products 
used in particular markets, such as those that 
come in contact with food, undergo additional 
SHE assessments as appropriate. 

In addition, we provide information to those 
who transport, use, and dispose of our prod-
ucts, including appropriate uses, potential 

product stewardship in the chemical business

Increasingly, our customers look to us 
to help them achieve their sustainability 
goals. In 2008, we created our Chemical 
Research Sustainability Team, which 
is responsible for conducting life cycle 
analyses (LCA) to support every Chemical 
business unit. LCAs allow us to evaluate 
product benefits and to design products in 
response to customer demands. Typically, 
an LCA study can take from three to more 
than 12 months to complete, depending on 
the breadth and complexity of the project. 

In 2007, a European Union (EU) regula-
tion for chemicals manufactured or used 
in EU member states went into effect. The 
REACH regulation requires manufacturers 
or importers to register and provides the 
European Chemical Agency with the right 
to evaluate and authorize chemicals. In 
2010, ExxonMobil submitted more than 
500 dossiers covering all substances 
needing registration by the 2010 regulatory 
deadline. We are now focused on updat-
ing our Safety Data Sheets and preparing 
dossiers for lower-volume substances with 

2013 and 2018 registration deadlines. The 
objectives of REACH are aligned with our 
commitment to product stewardship and 
accessibility of information. 

Through the International Council of 
Chemical Associations, ExxonMobil 
Chemical promotes the safe management 
of chemicals as outlined in the principles of 
the Global Product Strategy. We support 
voluntary programs such as Responsible 
Care® and the Global Product Strategy in 
developing regions of the world. 

16     exxonmobil.com

employee benefits and programs. We 
provide all employees with a competitive 
package of benefits and programs, which 
varies based on the legal requirements and 
culture of countries. Benefit coverage for 
spouses is based on legally recognized 
spousal relationships in the individual coun-
tries where we operate. In the United States, 
we have adopted the definition of spouse 
used in federal law, which provides benefits 
to heterosexual couples. Employees in coun-
tries where national law recognizes same-sex 
relationships are provided spousal benefits 
under ExxonMobil programs.

We take our benefit plan commitments seri-
ously. The funding levels of all qualified pension 
plans are in compliance with standards set by 
applicable law or regulation. All defined benefit 
pension obligations are fully supported by the 
financial strength of the Corporation or the 
respective sponsoring affiliate. 

employee engagement. ExxonMobil seeks 
to create an environment of open communi-
cation with our more than 83,000 employees. 
During the annual performance assessment 
and development process, all employees 
have a structured, documented discussion 
with their supervisors about work goals, 
training objectives, and development needs. 
This process provides the basis for ongoing 
employee coaching and continuous perform- 
ance improvement. Employees are actively 
developed throughout the course of their 
careers with training, mentoring, and oppor-
tunities to join professional networks.

Engagement with senior management takes 
place in the form of employee forums, where 
senior managers engage with employees 
on many topics such as business or safety 
performance, public policy, and long-term 
planning. During these forums, employees 
may ask questions on any topic. In 2010, 
Management Committee members and the 
presidents of the functional companies held 
more than 25 meetings with employees. 

In 2010, ExxonMobil and XTO Energy Inc. com-
pleted an all-stock transaction to create a new 
organization focused on global development 

Achieving Nobody Gets Hurt in the workplace requires us to continuously assess and enhance our 
systems, programs, and practices.

health and environmental effects, personal 
protection and exposure controls, first aid 
measures, and disposal considerations. 
Through a disciplined surveillance process, 
we tailor our product safety warnings to comply 
with current and emerging local regulations. 
In 2010, more than 400,000 Safety Data 
Sheets covering more than 130,000 unique 
products were distributed to customers in 
more than 85 languages.

Employment policies and  
practices 
Our employment practices are governed by 
our Standards of Business Conduct, which 
support our commitment to equal employ-
ment opportunity, prohibit harassment and 
discrimination in the workplace, and are con-
sistent with applicable laws and regulations 
of the countries in which we operate.

OIMS and other management systems 
ensure compliance with product steward-
ship regulations in more than 150 countries. 
Our Product Stewardship Information 
Management System (PSIMS) applies 
common global processes and a single 
global computer system to capture and 
communicate information on the safe han-
dling, transport, use, and disposal of our 
products. PSIMS incorporates more than 
5000 automated assessments to consis-
tently appraise product characteristics and 
uses for compliance with existing global 
laws and regulations, and to provide respon-
sible standards to specify precautions 
where laws and regulations do not exist or 
are considered inadequate.

policies against discrimination and harass-
ment. Any form of discrimination by or toward 
employees, contractors, suppliers, and 
customers in any ExxonMobil workplace is 
strictly prohibited. Our global, zero-tolerance 
policy applies to all forms of discrimination, 
including discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Harassment, 
even in its most subtle forms, is in direct 
conflict with company policy and will not 
be tolerated. All employees are subject to 
disciplinary action up to, and including, 
termination for any act of harassment. We 
have deployed a comprehensive education, 
training, and stewardship program to ensure 
this policy is understood, implemented, and 
followed by our employees throughout our 
worldwide operations. Each affiliate has 
adopted ExxonMobil’s global standards, 
with modifications as required for compliance 
with country law. 

building a Culture of Health

In the United States, our ExxonMobil 
medical plan includes a program, Partners 
in Health, to help employees and their 
families manage long-term health by focus-
ing on disease management, prevention, 
and lifestyle habits. In addition to these 
Partners in Health tools, from 2009 to 
2010, a Culture of Health pilot program was 

implemented at the Brookhollow office 
complex in Houston, Texas, and the Joliet 
Refinery in Illinois to expand opportunities 
for employees to identify health risks and 
adopt healthier lifestyles. 

Many employees took advantage of the 
online health assessment, on-site biometric 
screenings, and one-on-one telephone calls 

with health coaches. On-site programs 
such as physical activity challenges and 
weight-loss support groups encouraged a 
culture of health in the workplace. In 2011, 
an expansion of this program is expected 
in the United States.

merged company for operations. ExxonMobil 
and XTO management have taken all neces-

XTO understand how important they are to

diversity. Our global reach is evident in more 
than just our physical locations. The diversity 
and inclusion of thought, skill, knowledge, 
and culture of our global workforce make us 
more competitive, more resilient, and better 
able to navigate the complex and constantly 
changing global energy business. Our Global 
Workforce Diversity Framework is intended 
to attract, develop, and retain a premier 
workforce; actively foster a work environment 
where individual and cultural differences 
are respected and valued; and identify and 
develop leadership capabilities of employees 
to perform effectively in a variety of environ-
ments. Local employee networks exist in 
various locations and provide a positive, 
informal environment for career develop-
ment information, act as an advisory group to 
management, build cultural awareness, and 
support community outreach. 

At year-end 2010, about 40 percent of our 
employees were located within the United 
States and 60 percent internationally. In 2010, 
approximately 34 percent of our executives 
were non-U.S. employees. We hired more 
than 2400 management and professional 
employees worldwide, of whom approximately 
70 percent were outside the United States. 

ExxonMobil promotes leadership opportuni-
ties for women globally to improve the gender 
balance within our company. Currently, 
women account for about 26 percent of our 
worldwide workforce, excluding company-
operated retail stores. 

In 2010, 40 percent of management and pro-
fessional new hires were women, significantly 
higher than the percentage of women in our 
broader employee population. Approximately 
14 percent of executive employees world-
wide are women, compared to 13 percent in 
2009. One significant challenge in attaining 
gender balance in technology companies 
like ExxonMobil is a long-standing trend of 
fewer women selecting college majors and 
careers in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics. ExxonMobil is supporting 
efforts to make access to science, technol-
ogy, engineering, and mathematics education 
more widely available, particularly to women 
and minorities in the United States (see pages 
42 and 43). 

We are also working to increase the 
representation of minorities, including 
African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and 
Native Americans, in our U.S. operations. 
For example, our hiring programs include 
outreach to ensure diverse candidates are 
identified. Based on U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission reporting, minorities 
comprised approximately one-third of our 
U.S. workforce and 21 percent of officials  
and managers in 2010.

ExxonMobil’s approach to ensuring integrity in our operations was fundamentally influenced by the 
1989 Valdez oil spill. The accident triggered a re-evaluation of our understanding of risk management 
at a fundamental level. Today, a comprehensive Framework—called the Operations Integrity Management 
System (OIMS)—underpins every operating decision we make.

A key outcome of the Valdez oil spill was the 
realization that safety is more than a priority. 
It must be a value that shapes our decision 
making at every level of the organization. 
Ensuring this vision was incorporated into 
our day-to-day activities required a top-
to-bottom review of all operations with the 
intention of reorganizing the company to 
make safety—of people, facilities, and the 
environment—the center of decision making. 
ExxonMobil’s goal of driving accidents and 
incidents to zero has not yet been achieved, 
but through OIMS we continue to pursue it.

The OIMS Framework
The OIMS Framework establishes common 
worldwide expectations for addressing 
safety, security, health, environmental, and 
social risk in every aspect of our business. 
OIMS guides the activities of more than 
83,000 employees and roughly an equal 
number of third-party contractors around 
the world. OIMS does not just provide over-
sight; it fundamentally drives our operations 
from top to bottom.

Through OIMS, ExxonMobil monitors, 
benchmarks, and measures our perform- 
ance. OIMS consists of 11 separate 
Elements that address all aspects of 
management (see graphic). The standard 
11 Elements and 65 Expectations included 
in OIMS are the same for all employees, no 

matter where they are in the organization. 
From there, it is the responsibility of the 
businesses to supplement the Framework 
by establishing and maintaining guidelines 
relevant to their specific activities. Finally, 
local management systems provide addi-
tional guidance, including processes and 
procedures, responsible and accountable 
resources, and feedback mechanisms for 
continuous improvement. 

A critical component of the OIMS Framework 
is assessment and improvement. OIMS 
requires us to regularly evaluate our opera-
tions. Approximately 50 to 70 assessments 
are conducted annually, performed not 
only by trained safety, security, health, and 
environmental experts, but by cross- 
functional, cross-regional teams. In this 
way, the knowledge and observations 
employees gain are taken back to their jobs 
and spread across the organization.

To further drive continuous improvement, 
the Framework is periodically updated to 
address learnings, often based on internal or 
external events that need to be institutional-
ized and embedded into the Framework. 

Success factors
Many other companies have similar systems 
in place, some of which were influenced by 
OIMS. The unique aspect of OIMS is the 

ExxonMobil employees understand that OIMS is 
part of their job. Employees are trained to identify 
hazards, assess risks, and to speak up about any 
issues they observe.

degree to which the system is integrated into 
our day-to-day operations. 

One of the greatest benefits of OIMS is that it 
enables ExxonMobil—a large organization that 
operates across diverse cultures and geogra-
phies—to speak the same language when it 
comes to safety and risk management. 

OIMS is part of our culture. Its components 
allow our employees to drive our organiza-
tion’s success. Our goal is not simply to 
follow procedures. A culture of compliance 

the blackbeard well:  
element 2 - risk assessment and Management and element 7 - Management of change

ExxonMobil’s systematic and disciplined 
approach serves as a critical tool to 
manage the risks associated with oil and 
gas exploration and development.

In September 2006, drilling efforts were 
underway on a challenging exploration well 
in the Gulf of Mexico called Blackbeard, 
where seismic reports suggested the 
presence of approximately 1 billion 
barrels of oil and gas. In accordance 
with OIMS Element 2 (Risk Assessment 
and Management), an extensive risk 

assessment was conducted prior to 
starting the operation in order to identify 
potential hazards—everything from hur-
ricanes to the location of underground 
formations. From that risk assessment, 
we developed a project plan that included 
specific risk mitigation procedures. 

After drilling to a depth of more than 
30,000 feet and investing $187 million, 
measurements indicated higher pressures 
than previously predicted, increasing the 
risk of continued drilling. 

OIMS Element 7 (Management of Change) 
requires that once the drilling plan has 
commenced, any change in the plan must 
be evaluated, approved, and documented. 
Taking into account the potential well 
pressure, we assessed risks and evaluated 
mitigation strategies. After management 
review, we concluded that the level of 
risk associated with continued drilling 
outweighed the potential benefits. Drilling 
operations were discontinued and the well 
was safely abandoned.

alone can lead to complacency. We seek to 
create a culture in which employees meet 
and challenge procedures so they can be 
improved when needed.

The 11 Elements of OIMS are fundamental 
to safe and responsible operations. But 
the first and last Elements—Management 
Leadership, Commitment, and Accountability 
and Operations Integrity Assessment and 
Improvement—are perhaps the most critical. 
Without leadership by example and without 
thoughtful, honest, and objective self-
assessment, no system is sustainable.

Our journey toward achieving zero incidents 
is far from complete, but we have made sig-
nificant progress. More importantly, we are 
dedicated to learning until we do achieve 
our vision of a workplace where Nobody 
Gets Hurt, where Security is Everybody’s 
Business, and where our environmental 
performance can Protect Tomorrow. Today.

safely shutting down and restarting operations: 
element 6 - operations and Maintenance

ExxonMobil’s manufacturing sites regu-
larly conduct large-scale maintenance 
efforts called turnarounds, which can 
range in scope from a single piece of 
equipment to an entire facility. During 
a turnaround, relevant components are 
shut down, inspected, upgraded, and 
then restarted. Experience shows that 
these periods of nonroutine activity can 
pose greater potential for safety and 
environmental incidents. OIMS Element 6 
provides detailed tools and checklists to 
reduce the potential for error by providing 
a systematic process to ensure hazards 
are identified, procedures are clear and 
understood, and controls are in place.

In 2010, the Baytown Refinery in Texas 
conducted its largest-ever turnaround. 
The event required approximately  
3500 contractors and more than 450 

employees to work more than 1.8 million 
hours on six units. In anticipation of the 
large influx of personnel and work activity 
on-site, a special safety campaign was 
implemented. The turnaround manage-
ment team conducted a comprehensive 
risk analysis and developed risk manage-
ment procedures. They also used peer 
reviews, daily and weekly safety meetings, 
and recognition programs to reinforce 
and sustain the safety culture. By the 
end of the turnaround, only one record-
able incident occurred, involving a minor 
finger injury. As part of our commitment 
to safety, we held a mandatory contrac-
tor safety stand-down to discuss and 
review incident prevention tools. Lessons 
learned from this turnaround were also 
shared with other sites in an effort to drive 
incidents to zero.

Good corporate governance creates a climate conducive to long-term investments and underpins the 
foundation of sustainable economic growth. In an industry where business and investment decisions 
can have impacts for decades, the benefits of implementing strong corporate governance practices 
are also enduring.

The methods we employ to achieve results 
are as important as the results themselves. 
We observe the highest standards of integrity 
and ethics to develop, approve, and imple-
ment projects designed to be responsive 
to society’s present and future energy and 
petrochemical needs.

Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors provides indepen-
dent oversight of the management of the 
Corporation. All directors stand for election 
at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At 
year-end 2010, 10 of 11 directors and all 
members of key Board committees, including 
the presiding director, were independent as 
defined by New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) 
guidelines. In 2010, the Board of Directors 
met nine times and our Audit, Board Affairs, 
Compensation, and Public Issues and 
Contributions Committees each met between 
5 and 11 times. The Board annually con-
ducts group performance and effectiveness 
evaluations. Individual director performance 
reviews are not a part of this process. For 
more information about the Board, see our 
proxy statement.

board structure. At this time, the Board 
believes the interests of all shareholders are 
best served through a leadership model with 
a combined chairman of the Board and chief 
executive officer (CEO). With more than 35 years 
of service, the current CEO possesses in-depth 
knowledge of the Corporation, putting him in 
the best position to provide broad leadership 
for the Board. The Board retains the author-
ity to separate the positions of chairman and 
CEO if deemed appropriate in the future. 

The independent members of the Board 
annually select an independent director 
to serve as presiding director, to act as a 
liaison with the chairman, and to chair Board 
meetings in his absence. Although this posi-
tion is subject to annual elections, there is 
an expectation that the same director will 
serve for at least two years. The presiding 
director chairs executive sessions of the 
non-employee directors and provides feed-
back to the chairman. All directors have the 
authority to call executive sessions, which 
are regularly scheduled without manage-
ment present, unless requested by the 
presiding director.

board committees. Corporate citizenship 
topics fall under the purview of the Public 
Issues and Contributions, Board Affairs, 
and Compensation Committees and are 
routinely reviewed at Board and Board  
committee meetings. 

Risk oversight is the responsibility of the full 
Board. The committees help the Board carry 
out this responsibility by focusing on specific 
aspects of risk that are relevant to their com-
mittee. Each committee’s charter is available 
on our Web site. 

diversity. Maintaining a Board of Directors 
that is diverse in gender, race, experience, 
geography, life experiences, and fields of 
expertise is a top priority for ExxonMobil.  
In 2010, the Board included female, African-
American, and international perspectives.  
The Board Affairs Committee serves as 
the nominating committee and follows the 
Guidelines for the Selection of Non-Employee 
Directors that describe qualification criteria of 
directors. This committee considers recom-
mendations from shareholders, directors, and 
others on director candidates and engages 
an executive search firm to help identify new 
director candidates.

executive compensation. At ExxonMobil, 
the most senior executives—including the 
CEO, named executive officers, and about 
1200 other U.S. executives—participate 
in a common compensation program. 
Compensation decisions for executives take 
into account several key criteria, including 

results in the areas of safety, security, health, 
and environmental performance. For example, 
ExxonMobil’s success in managing risk in 
these areas is achieved through emphasis on 
flawless execution of our OIMS Framework 
(see page 18), and executives understand that 
their compensation will reflect how effectively 
they implement this Framework. The design 
of the executive compensation program, 
including the long vesting requirements and 
risk of forfeiture of stock awards, ensures 
that senior executives have a strong financial 
incentive to protect the safety and security of 
our employees, the communities and environ-
ment in which we operate, and the value of 
the company for shareholders. 

communicating with directors. ExxonMobil’s 
directors encourage open and transpar-
ent communication. Key topics include 
executive compensation, environmental or 
other public issues, dividends, common 
stock price, gasoline prices, and corporate 
governance. The Corporate Governance 
page of our Web site allows individuals to 
send e-mails to our non-employee directors. 
Written letters can also be sent in care of 
the Secretary of the Corporation. 

Shareholder proposals and 
proxy statements
Every year, shareholders submit propos-
als regarding the company’s operations or 
corporate governance. Management and the 
Board consider these proposals and typically

seek a dialogue with the proposal sponsor. 
If the dialogue successfully addresses the 
concerns of the sponsor, the proposal is 
often withdrawn. Otherwise and unless 
excluded under U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission rules, the proposal and the 
Board’s response and recommendation are 
published in our proxy statement for review  
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 

In 2010, about 3.8 billion—or nearly 81 percent 
—of the outstanding shares were rep-
resented at the Corporation’s Annual 
Meeting. In 2010, actions taken related to 
issues reflected in shareholder propos-
als included the development of a land 
conservation strategy and the doubling of 
certified wildlife habitat programs; drafting 
a public communication on oil sands; and 
refinement of a document highlighting best 
practices and chemical disclosures relating 
to natural gas production. 

Ethics
ExxonMobil transacts business activities in 
nearly every country of the world, necessitat-
ing regular training on international trade laws, 
including the anti-corruption and antitrust 
laws of the United States and other countries 
where we do business. All employees are 
expected to uphold high ethical standards 

and business integrity. They must comply with 
all applicable laws and accurately record and 
track all transactions. Employees are subject 
to disciplinary action up to, and including, 
termination for violations of our policies. 
Employees receive training on our ethics 
policy every four years through Business 
Practices Reviews, including a detailed  
review of our Standards of Business Conduct; 
implementation guidelines and procedures; 
and a review of antitrust, competition, and 
anti-corruption laws. These general training 
sessions, in addition to more comprehensive 
training given to relevant functions, are a 
requirement of employment at ExxonMobil. 
This training is supplemented by annual 
redistribution of the policy to ensure ongoing 
employee awareness. The next general review 
session is scheduled for 2012.

Standards of Business Conduct. Our com-
mitment to ethics creates a competitive 
advantage for the Corporation and helps 
ensure shareholder value. Our culture 
of ethical standards and compliance is 
documented in our Standards of Business 
Conduct, which foster the values of human 
rights, labor standards, the environment, 
and anti-corruption as outlined in the United 
Nations Global Compact. While ExxonMobil 
is not a formal signatory of the Global 
Compact, its values are key elements of 

our Standards. The Board of Directors has 
adopted and oversees the administration of 
the Standards—the foundation policies of 
the Corporation. The Standards articulate 
expectations and define the basis for the 
worldwide conduct of the Corporation and 
its majority-owned subsidiaries. Employees 
are expected to review the Standards 
each year. Disciplinary action is taken 
against any employee who violates these 
Standards. There are absolutely no excep-
tions to this approach. 

internal audits. Regular internal audits and 
self-assessments help ensure the rigorous 
implementation of our control systems and 
Standards. ExxonMobil’s internal audit 
team annually audits about one-third of 
ExxonMobil’s operations, conducting detailed 
assessments of facilities, business units, 
personnel, and records, and thoroughly inves-
tigating noncompliance with the Standards. 

bribery and corruption. We maintain our 
strong commitment to anti-corruption prac-
tices in all of our operations worldwide. The 
Anti-Corruption Legal Compliance Summary 
details our commitment to compliance with 
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) 
and global anti-corruption conventions in all 
business relationships, including those with 
consultants, agents, and intermediaries. To 
ensure compliance, ExxonMobil employees  
and contractors are prohibited from making 
improper payments to, or engaging in improper 
transactions with, government officials to 
influence the performance of their official 
duties. As required under the FCPA, we 
maintain appropriate internal controls and 
keep accurate and complete records of the 
transactions in which we engage.

In a few parts of the world, we conduct 
oil and gas exploration and production in 
remote areas where there may only be a 
limited number of local businesses and 
a small technically skilled population. 
Government structures and local business 
practices are sometimes closely linked 
through social and family relationships. In 
these challenging situations, ExxonMobil 
steadfastly upholds our commitment to full 

supplier standards

Suppliers and contractors are expected to 
adhere to all local laws and regulations, as 
well as ExxonMobil policies, procedures, 
and prequalification requirements. This 
includes compliance with our requirements 
regarding safety, security, health, environ-
ment, and human rights, as well as the 
principles of our Standards of Business 

Conduct. A contractor who violates our 
Standards will be in breach of contract and 
may be subject to contractual and legal 
remedies, including, in some cases, denial 
of access to our facilities and termination 
of the contract. Our procurement staff is 
trained to conduct prequalification assess-
ments, which include anti-corruption due 

diligence; restricted parties screening; 
and standard legal terms and conditions, 
including human rights, labor practices, 
financial and operational qualifications, 
export restrictions, and security concerns, 
including the Customs-Trade Partnership 
Against Terrorism.

compliance with the FCPA and local laws, 
even if it requires extensive analysis of busi-
ness relationships to ensure transparency. 
Our standard language for all contracts 
includes a requirement to comply with 
all laws and to keep accurate books and 
records, and where appropriate, contains 
specific anti-bribery commitments. For all 
new agreements and renewals, our procure-
ment staff assesses baseline information 
obtained in procurement processes to 
recognize warning signs, and when neces-
sary, consults the law department. In addition, 
procurement staff must comply with a 
mandatory screening process to ensure that 
proper anti-corruption due diligence is being 
performed on intermediaries in countries 
that are assessed to be high-risk for cor-
ruption. This process involves identifying 
high-risk parties, gathering additional infor-
mation on those parties, and consulting with 
the law department.

training. Political and regulatory landscapes 
across the globe are constantly changing 
and require diligent anti-corruption training 
programs. In 2010, more than 33,000 employ-
ees whose positions may require interaction 
with government agencies or officials 
received anti-corruption training. This training 
covered the basics of the FCPA, global anti-
corruption standards, recent developments 
in enforcement, and compliance with internal 
anti-corruption guidelines and processes. 
Additionally, we monitor events and political 
changes and alert employees as appropri-
ate. Every four years, all employees attend 
mandatory Business Practices Reviews that 
address anti-corruption issues (see Ethics, 
on page 22). 

reporting and investigating suspected 
violations. All employees are responsible for 
reporting any and all suspected violations of 
company policies. The Corporation provides 
several confidential mechanisms for report-
ing, including a 24-hour hotline phone number 
and mailing address. It is a violation of the 
Corporation’s procedures for an employee to 
be penalized or threatened in any way after 
filing a report. A Hotline Steering Committee, 
comprising security, audit, law, and human 
resources personnel, handles suspected 
violations and provides a report to the Audit 
Committee on a quarterly basis. All reports 
of suspected violations of law, business 
practices, or internal control procedures 
are thoroughly investigated, and major 
issues or violations are reported to the Audit 
Committee. Appropriate disciplinary action is 
taken for all violations, and no exceptions are 
made based on level of employment.

Management systems
Across all areas of the Corporation, 
ExxonMobil complies with applicable laws 
and regulations, and where laws and regula-
tions do not exist, we maintain the use of our 
internal standards. Our management systems 
help identify, track, and report the metrics 
that demonstrate and guide our performance 
over time. They also provide the structure that 
enables our operations to adapt to new or 
altered regulations. 

Operations Integrity Management System. 
Our Operations Integrity Management System 
(OIMS) addresses all aspects of managing 
safety, security, health, environmental, and 
social risks at our operations worldwide (see 
page 18). 

OIMS conforms with recognized safety, 
security, health, environmental, and chemical 
industry standards (for example, Responsible 
Care®), and requires us to assess the effec-
tiveness of the system on a regular basis. In 
2010, Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, 
Inc., reviewed our ongoing performance and 
attested that OIMS is fully consistent with 
the standard on environmental management 
systems of the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO 14001:2004) and the 
Occupational Health and Safety Assessment 
Series for health and safety management 
systems (OHSAS 18001:2007).

control systems. The ExxonMobil System 
of Management Control Basic Standards 
defines the basic principles and concepts 
that drive our business controls across 
operations worldwide. Our Controls Integrity 
Management System provides a structured 
approach to assessing and measuring finan-
cial control risks, developing procedures for 
mitigating concerns, monitoring compliance 
with standards, and reporting results to the 
appropriate operations and management 
groups within ExxonMobil. These company-
wide financial controls meet or exceed the 
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and 
NYSE listing standards. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP conducted an 
independent assessment that determined 
our internal controls system is effective for 
financial reporting. Regular self-assessments 
and audits help ensure our controls and 
standards are consistently implemented by 
every operating unit. 

Political involvement
ExxonMobil makes political contributions 
to candidate committees, political parties, 
associations, and other political organizations, 
as permitted by applicable laws in the United 
States and Canada, and as authorized by 
the Board of Directors. In 2010, Exxon Mobil 

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     23

Corporation contributed a total of $396,000 
to legislative and gubernatorial candidates and 
caucuses in 15 U.S. states. Information about 
our political activities, policy, guidelines, and 
an itemized list of these corporate political 
contributions are available on our Web site. 

In the 2009 to 2010 election cycle, ExxonMobil’s 
employee- and retiree-funded political action 
committee (PAC) disbursed $1.2 million, 
mostly to federal candidates. Based on the 
2009 to 2010 election cycle contributions, 
CQ Moneyline listed the ExxonMobil PAC 
No. 114 in size compared to other PACs and 
candidate and/or party committees. Among 
corporate PACs, the ExxonMobil PAC 
ranked No. 41 in size in terms of receipts 
from employees and retiree shareholders, 
and No. 46 in size of total contributions to 
candidates. All rankings are compiled from 
publicly available data filed with the Federal 
Election Commission.

political lobbying and advocacy. ExxonMobil 
tracks proposed legislation and engages with 
governments around the world to advocate 
our position on policies that impact our 
operations. Lobbying and advocacy activi-
ties are necessary to ensure the company’s 
long-term success and protect shareholder 
value. ExxonMobil actively lobbies the U.S. 
Congress and state legislatures on a number 
of public policy topics, including access to 
resources, taxes, energy policy, trade, and 
climate policy. 

We fully comply with regulations by report-
ing federal lobbying expenses in quarterly 
disclosure reports to Congress. A complete 
list of federal issues lobbied by ExxonMobil in 
the United States in 2010 can be found in the 
public disclosure section of the U.S. Senate 
Web site. In 2010, ExxonMobil reported lob-
bying expenses totaling $12.4 million in our 
public Lobby Disclosures Act filings.

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     25

As one of the leading petroleum and natural gas companies, ExxonMobil takes our environmental 
responsibilities very seriously. The Deepwater Horizon incident was a tragic event that reminded 
our entire industry of the need to be ever-vigilant in the areas of safety and environmental protection. 
To produce energy responsibly, we must understand and actively manage environmental risks and 
relentlessly focus on operational excellence.

Managing to reduce  
environmental impacts
Our Operations Integrity Management 
System (OIMS, see page 18) provides a 
systematic and disciplined approach to man-
aging safety, security, health, environmental, 
and social risks. OIMS is consistent with the 
standard for environmental management 
systems established by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO 
14001:2004). Together, our Corporate 
Environment Policy and OIMS Framework 
set an expectation that all projects will be 
developed, constructed, maintained, and 
operated using appropriate standards— 
including where regulations are not  
adequately protective of the environment. 

Our Protect Tomorrow. Today. initiative 
outlines our expectations for each business 
to deliver superior environmental perfor-
mance, drive environmental incidents with real 
impact to zero, and achieve industry-leading 
performance in focus areas of importance to 
each business. Progress toward these goals is 
managed through our Environmental Business 
Planning (EBP) process, which integrates 
environmental improvement into overall busi-
ness plans and strategies. The businesses 
use EBP to identify key environmental drivers, 
set targets in high-priority focus areas, and 
identify actions to achieve these targets.

A life cycle approach to  
environmental protection 
Life cycle thinking contributes to managing 
the full range of potential environmental and 
social impacts associated with our operations 
and products. We take a holistic approach to 
understanding our impacts from initial explo-
ration activities to eventual closure. 

Assessing our surroundings

1
Delivering superior environmental perfor-
mance starts with planning. For new projects, 
risk-based Environmental, Socioeconomic, 

and Health Impact Assessments (ESHIAs) 
are conducted to review community concerns, 
sensitive environmental habitats, land use, air 
quality, water management, waste manage-
ment, biodiversity, noise, public health, and 
future regulatory developments. The ESHIA 
process requires engagement with key stake-
holders throughout the project’s life cycle. The 
results, which include opportunities for avoiding, 
reducing, and mitigating potentially negative 
impacts as well as enhancing project benefits, 
are integrated into project evaluation, planning, 
and decision making. Early identification of 
potential impacts allows us to develop project 
alternatives, reduce impacts to the environment, 
improve safety, and decrease operating costs. 

protecting biodiversity. We recognize that
protecting biodiversity—the variety and 
complexity of life—is an important conserva-
tion issue that presents broad challenges. 
We successfully operate in sensitive areas by 
implementing scientifically sound, practical, and 
sustainable solutions rooted in environmental 
aspects assessment and risk management. 
These processes recognize a variety of factors 
such as rarity, vulnerability, and cultural value 
of biodiversity and ecosystems. These factors 
determine the levels of risk associated with our 
operations and appropriate actions to manage 
those risks. To protect particular species and 
sensitive habitats, we take steps such as 
modifying engineering design, construction, 
and operating practices, and enhancing wildlife 
habitats at our properties. We also support 
advocacy, research, and partnerships to 
protect biodiversity outside our fence line. 

In 2010, we screened our sites against 
databases of the International Union for 
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and World 
Protected Areas (WPA). We are currently uti-
lizing this information to identify opportunities 
for enhancing measures to protect biodiver-
sity at major facilities or project sites in the 
immediate vicinity of these areas.

Gathering and analyzing sound environ-
mental data is an important aspect of our 
assessment process. We continue to work 
with the United Nations World Conservation 
Monitoring Centre (WCMC) to develop a 
comprehensive database for worldwide 
environmental conservation. In 2010, we also 
partnered with NatureServe and National 
Geographic to improve a mapping tool that 
lists threatened and endangered species as 

well as ecological system descriptions in the 
United States. The enhancements will allow 
users, including ExxonMobil, to better identify 
and evaluate the potential conservation value 
of land across the United States. 

In Qatar’s Ras Laffan liquefied natural gas 
operation, water treated with trace amounts 
of chlorine must be used in the process of 
cooling gas to liquid. ExxonMobil Research 
Qatar conducted an environmental research 
project studying coastal water quality near 
Ras Laffan Industrial City. The two-year 
research project concluded that the very low 
concentrations of chlorination by-products 
associated with Ras Laffan cooling water  
discharges do not pose a risk to marine life. 
A report of the study was shared with the 
Qatari Ministry of the Environment as part of 
our ongoing engagement in the Gulf Region.

ExxonMobil’s 14 sites with Wildlife Habitat 
Council (WHC) certification increased the 
number of hectares actively managed for 
wildlife from 140 in 2009 to more than 2600 in 
2010. We have also identified additional sites 
for future WHC certification. 

In 2010, ExxonMobil contributed more than  
$3 million to organizations dedicated to bio-
diversity and land conservation. For example, 
in a unique partnership with the scientific 
community, the Angolan government, and the 
private sector, ExxonMobil and the Block 15 
consortium contributed more than $1 million 
between 2008 and 2010 to support efforts to 
protect the critically endangered Angolan Giant 
Black Sable antelope. The funding enabled 
the conservation program to relocate nine 
females and one male to a 400-hectare sanctu-
ary within the Cangandala National Park. The 
sanctuary increases breeding opportunities 
and in 2010 led to the birth of two offspring.

Designing our facilities  

2
and operations
ExxonMobil integrates environmental con-
cerns and regulatory requirements early in 
the project design process, as part of the 
ExxonMobil Capital Projects Management 
System (EMCAPS). Potential risks are ana-
lyzed for avoidance and reduction options, 
and practical alternatives are included from 
the start. We comply with all applicable host-
country regulatory requirements and, where 
there are none, we perform to standards that 
are protective of the environment.

A unique public-private partnership in Angola led 
to the birth of a rare Angolan Giant Black Sable 
antelope calf in 2010.

In 2010, we implemented Expectations for 
Project Environmental Standards to establish 
a consistent approach across the Corporation. 
Each business is expected to develop, 
maintain, and consistently apply Project 
Environmental Standards applicable to the 
specific risks of that business. The businesses 
are now developing applicable Standards, and 
this effort will be completed by year-end 2013. 

For example, the ExxonMobil Development 
Company’s Environmental Standards set 
the basis for responsible environmental 
development of upstream projects, includ-
ing in regions of the world that do not have 
comprehensive environmental protection 
requirements. These project Environmental 
Standards include:

•  Air emissions (sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and 
particulate matter);

•  Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions;

•  Drill cuttings discharge, water manage-
ment, waste management, and land use;

•  Flare and venting;

•  Energy efficiency and greenhouse  
gases (GHGs); 

•  Marine geophysical operations; and,

•  Socioeconomic impacts. 

Through the Expectations for Project 
Environmental Standards initiative, these 
Standards are being implemented across all 
upstream companies. To date, the Standards 
for drill cuttings discharge, flare and vent 
reduction, and energy efficiency and GHGs 
have been adopted by all upstream companies.

  Operating with integrity
OIMS outlines our approach to communicat-
ing expectations, measuring progress, and 
striving to improve environmental perfor-
mance. Our Environment Policy encourages 
concern and respect for the environment and 
emphasizes every employee’s responsibility 
for environmental performance. Employees 
are expected to actively prevent environ-
mental incidents, and to respond quickly and 
effectively when incidents occur. 

assessing our surroundings in papua new Guinea

The Papua New Guinea (PNG) liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) project is an integrated 
development that includes gas production 
and processing facilities in the Southern 
Highlands and Western Provinces of 
Papua New Guinea, connected by more 
than 700 kilometers of pipelines. 

Papua New Guinea is one of the least 
explored countries on earth, largely due 
to its rugged, mountainous terrain and 
dense vegetation. It is also a nation of 
rich biodiversity and distinctive cultures 
of people who are closely linked to the 
natural environment. 

This environment, as well as the complexity, 
scale, and scope of the project, make it  
one of the most challenging projects ever 
undertaken in our industry.

Our goal is to develop and operate the PNG 
LNG project in a way that protects Papua 
New Guinea’s natural and social environ-
ments while helping to bring economic 
benefits to its citizens. This will require 
proven technology and experts, use of 
ExxonMobil management systems such 
as OIMS, and extensive engagement and 
involvement of local communities. 

In such a unique location, impact assess-
ments are a critical part of project design, 
construction, and operation. In 2009, the 
PNG LNG Project Environmental Impact 

Statement (EIS) was submitted to and 
approved by the government as part of the 
project permitting process. 

The EIS describes the biophysical and 
social environment and builds on work 
completed over the past 20 years by the 
petroleum industry. Altogether, there have 
been 5700 social surveys involving more 
than 24,000 interviews with local people, 
representing more than 40 percent of all 
households in the project area. In addition, 
biodiversity studies were undertaken for  
78 sites, which produced nearly 4000 records 
for fauna species alone and identified more 
than a thousand species of plants. Overall,  
some 80 species of vertebrate fauna and 
higher plants that were new to science have 
been identified. 

The EIS was an initial step in the development 
of our environmental and social management 
processes. The project’s Environment Permit 
requires more detailed analyses to identify 
site-specific sensitivities and mitigation 
practices prior to facility and infrastructure 
construction, including the pipeline route 
and associated project footprint. 

Pre-construction surveys identify poten-
tial impacts of construction activities 
on community infrastructure as well as 
environmental and social sensitivities. They 
address concerns related to archaeology, 
cultural heritage, ecology, invasive species, 

and water quality. The resulting constraint 
maps, including mitigation options and 
recommendations to reduce impacts to 
communities and the environment, support 
decision making across all project locations. 

Sensitivities identified are managed through 
mitigation measures originally detailed in the 
EIS and further refined in the Environmental 
and Social Management Plans and pre-
construction surveys. 

To date, pre-construction surveys and reports 
have been finalized for 95 sites, and third-party 
experts have identified more than 1400 mitiga-
tion measures aimed at, for example:

•  Avoiding particularly sensitive ecological 
features; 

•  Minimizing vegetation clearance and 
overall project footprint; 

•  Preventing the introduction and spread of 
weeds and animal pests;

•  Controlling erosion and sedimentation 
and resulting impacts on water quality;

•  Promptly reinstating and stabilizing banks 
following construction of river crossings; 

•  Controlling access to new project roads;

•  Using timber from approved sources only; 

•  Handling, treating, and disposing of project 
solid wastes and wastewaters properly; and,

•  Minimizing noise from construction and 
operations.

The ability to efficiently collect and manage 
environmental information is essential for 
achieving compliance and improving per-
formance. In 2010, we implemented the first 
of a two-phase project to systematize and 
improve our environmental data information 
collection system. Phase one, referred to 
as C-EDMS, was successfully implemented 
across the Corporation in 2010. Phase two, 
S-EDMS, will be rolled out to sites and inte-
grated with existing emissions monitoring and 
measurement systems from 2011 to 2017. 

spill prevention. Spill prevention is of utmost 
importance to protect human health and the 
environment. ExxonMobil’s operations integ-
rity requirements seek to prevent spills by 
strengthening procedures, building in layers 
of protection, inspecting and maintaining 
equipment, training operators, and conducting 
tests and drills.

Marine vessel spill performance. For more 
than four years, vessels owned and operated 
by our marine affiliates have safely trans-
ported all cargoes without any spills to water 
greater than 1 barrel. In addition, it has been 
more than three years since the last spill from 
a barge, and there were no spills from long-
term chartered ships in 2010. 

We attribute this performance in part to the 
rigorous and systematic screening process 
used by our marine affiliates to examine 
hundreds of technical, operational, and other 
noncommercial factors. The people and 
processes involved in our marine activities are 
dedicated to continuous efforts to improve 
safety and environmental performance.

Unfortunately, one single-voyage chartered 
vessel experienced a spill in 2010 in Texas. 
ExxonMobil actively monitored the ship owner’s 
spill response and subsequent investigations. 

Other spill performance. In 2010, the total 
volume of hydrocarbons spilled to land  
or water was about 8 thousand barrels,  
60 percent of which was recovered at the site 
of the spill. The number of nonmarine hydro-
carbon spills greater than 1 barrel in 2010 was 
25 percent lower than in 2006 and 11 percent 
lower than 2009. In 2009, we did not meet  
our expectation of continued improvement  
of our spill performance. In 2010, we 
increased emphasis on spill prevention and 
re-established our improvement trend. 

After thorough analysis, we focused our effort 
on human behaviors that contribute to spills 
globally. Implementation of the Global Human 
Factors Best Practice Guide is intended to 
instill a zero-spill mindset throughout the 
organization. The Guide outlines 17 high-risk 
elements and corresponding procedures to 
reduce the likelihood of a human factor oil 
spill. In addition, we focused on achieving 
improvements at the refining sites with the 
highest spill rates over the last several years. 
A comprehensive improvement strategy was 
developed, which included root-cause analy-
sis, targeted equipment upgrades, enhanced 
risk mitigation through selective inspections, 
and improved recordkeeping. In the Upstream, 
we implemented oil spill prevention initiatives by 
establishing teams to address issues common 
to multiple areas and to standardize prevention 
practices by enhancing personnel training and 
by improving surveillance techniques for early 
identification of spill risks.

Marine well containment system

Today, deepwater production accounts for 
more than 5 percent of worldwide liquids 
supply, up from only 1 percent a decade ago. 
Ensuring this valuable resource is available to 
consumers means that the oil and gas indus-
try must work more diligently to prevent tragic 
incidents such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon 
spill in the Gulf of Mexico. While ExxonMobil 
believes such incidents are preventable, we 
recognize the energy industry should have 
been better prepared to respond. That is why 
ExxonMobil is leading a multicompany effort 
to build a new rapid-response marine well 
containment system for the Gulf of Mexico. 
The system, involving a $1 billion initial com-
mitment from the four sponsor companies, 
will provide pre-engineered, constructed, and 
tested containment technology and equipment 
to be deployed within 24 hours of a deepwater 
spill in the Gulf at depths up to 10,000 feet. 

This system builds on more than 40 years of 
internal oil spill response research. In recent 
years, we have spent between $2 million 
and $3 million per year on oil spill cleanup 
research, and we are conducting significant 
additional research in drilling and deepwater 
developments totaling more than $40 million 
per year. We are working with operators 
and national oil companies operating in 
other regions besides the Gulf of Mexico 
regarding the applicability of such systems. 
We support industry task forces under the 
International Association of Oil and Gas 
Producers and the International Petroleum 
Industry Environmental Conservation 
Association in assessing global needs and 
solutions for well containment, as well as 
other innovative solutions for spill response 
and cleanup. 

ExxonMobil is also participating in joint 
industry task forces to:

• Enhance drilling reliability;

• Improve safety, health, and environmental 
performance; 

• Recommend improvements to equipment 
design, testing protocols, research and 
development, and regulations; and,

• Protect public interests.

Following our engagement with the National 
Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon 
Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, we will 
continue to seek lessons learned from the 
incident and integrate them into our own 
plans and operations.

air emissions reductions. The use of fossil 
fuels releases VOCs, SO2, NOx, and par-
ticulates, which can contribute to air quality 
issues since high concentrations of these 
compounds can impact human health and the 
environment. ExxonMobil is co-sponsoring an 
interdisciplinary five-year research program, 
coordinated by the Health Effects Institute, 
focused on determining which particle constit-
uents impact health. Research findings will be 
used to develop more cost-effective emission 
control strategies targeting particles with the 
highest public health concern. The final results 
of the research should be available in 2013.

In 2010, our combined air emissions of 
VOCs, SO2, and NOx decreased by 6 percent 
from 2009 and 36 percent from 2006 levels. 
By year-end 2010, our U.S. refining facilities 
reduced combined NOx and SO2 emissions 
by over 70 percent from 2000 levels. With 
these reductions, we achieved our 2012  
commitment two years early. Since 2006,  
our global Chemical operations have been 
averaging a reduction per unit of production 
of 6 percent per year for VOCs and 3 percent 
per year for NOx. Greenhouse gas emissions  
are discussed in the Managing Climate Change 
Risks section of this report (see page 32).

freshwater management. A reliable supply 
of water is essential for life and for develop-
ing both fossil fuel and renewable sources of 
energy. With competing demands for water, 
regulations and international standards are 
growing more stringent. Protecting and 
preserving freshwater resources involves 
understanding supply and demand trends at 
the local level, assessing potential effects on 
quality and quantity, and implementing steps 
to appropriately address challenges. 

The prudent utilization of water resources, 
particularly freshwater resources, is a global 
issue that requires local understanding and 

action. In 2010, we used the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development’s water 
tool to identify regions where we operate 
that may have water scarcity concerns. 
Information on water stress and scarcity in 
the vicinity of our operations serves as an 
important element of environmental aspects 
assessment and risk management. Managing 
risks may include identifying and using 
alternate water supplies, reducing water use 
and increasing efficiency through technology, 
and considering external projects to address 
sustainability of supplies for all users of a 
particular water resource. 

In 2010, the net consumption of fresh water  
at our operations was 2140 million barrels, 
representing a 1-percent reduction from 
2009. Sites across our operations in scarce  
or stressed areas implemented a variety 
of projects to reduce water consumption 
in 2010. For example, the Altona Refinery 
in Australia improved the control system in 
its cooling towers, resulting in a 3-percent 
reduction in freshwater consumption. 

waste management. ExxonMobil’s approach 
to waste management begins with reducing 
waste at its source, followed by re-using 
and recycling waste, and finally disposing 
of any remaining waste in compliance with 
local regulations. 

The amount of hazardous waste disposed 
in 2010 from our ongoing operations totaled 
1.3 million metric tons. The majority of this 
volume, 1.2 million metric tons, was produced 
water, which is typically not considered 
hazardous, but which has been classified 
as hazardous waste by one local authority. 
Excluding this, we re-used or recycled about 
43 percent of the hazardous waste generated 
by our operations. 

dispersants enhance natural degradation of oil 

All marine environments contain naturally 
occurring microbes that feed on and break 
down crude oil. This means crude oil is 
largely biodegradable. Spilled oil tends 
to float on the surface of water in slicks. 
Treating a spill with dispersants allows very 
small droplets of oil to form, which then 
become distributed and diluted below the 
water’s surface. This enhances the access 
of microbes to the oil, thus increasing the 
rate of degradation. 

While the benefits of using dispersants 
have been questioned by stakeholders 
concerned about their chemical composi-
tion, studies have shown that dispersants 

are less toxic than oil, and dispersed oil 
breaks down faster than undispersed oil. 
When used appropriately, modern disper-
sants have low environmental and human 
health risk. For example, an Environment 
Canada study found a common dish soap 
to be 25 times more toxic to rainbow trout 
than a common dispersant. In its 2005 
report on modern dispersants and associ-
ated effects, the National Research Council 
stated that the toxicity of dispersed oil 
results primarily from the oil itself, and not 
from the dispersants. 

The dispersants developed by ExxonMobil 
contain ingredients that are used safely in 
a variety of consumer products, such as 
skin creams, cosmetics, and mouthwash. 
ExxonMobil continues to advance disper-
sant technology and has developed a new 
dispersant gel that could further reduce 
concerns about adding chemicals to the 
environment. This new gel can treat the 
same amount of oil with two-thirds less 
chemical volume than other dispersants. If 
final product stability tests are successful, 
ExxonMobil expects commercialization of 
this new dispersant in 2011. 

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     29

In 2010, the Baton Rouge Chemical Plant in 
Louisiana reduced the amount of metal waste 
it disposed by more than 140 metric tons 
by identifying a recycling facility that could 
process nickel, molybdenum, and cobalt waste.

Hazardous waste generated during site 
remediation activities varies from year to year 
due to the nature and timing of remediation 
and reclamation projects. In 2010, our reme-
diation activities generated approximately  
0.6 million metric tons of hazardous waste. 

environmental expenditures. Our worldwide 
environmental expenditures in 2010 totaled 
about $4.5 billion. This included about  
$1.9 billion in capital expenditures and 
about $2.6 billion in operating expenses. 
In 2010, 83 fines and settlements paid 
accounted for less than one-fourth of  
1 percent of total environmental expendi-
tures or about $11 million. 

Restoring the environment

4
Remediation and restoration activities reduce 
our overall environmental impact. We have 
improved ExxonMobil’s remediation results 
through a globally consistent approach. 

site remediation. Created in 2007, the 
ExxonMobil Environmental Services (EMES) 
functional organization has established a 
systematic framework for remediating soil and 
groundwater at ExxonMobil affiliate facili-
ties, inactive properties, and formerly owned 
sites around the world. Our ultimate goal is 
to enhance asset and community value while 
creating opportunities for beneficial re-use 
of inactive properties. One of the challenges 
posed by this work is determining how to 
characterize and measure progress of these 
projects. To this end, EMES has identified 
metrics to define and benchmark our progress. 

In 2010, EMES stewarded approximately 
9000 active projects worldwide. Some sites 
require minimal to no remediation activity, 
while others pose longer-term challenges. 

improving supply chain sustainability

ExxonMobil is working with our suppliers 
to identify sustainable alternatives through-
out the supply chain. Our procurement 
organization’s Total System Cost approach 
is intended to identify and reduce waste and 
inefficiency in the supply chain. Additionally, 
our global sourcing strategy development 
process encourages the consideration of 
environmental performance when making 
sourcing decisions. 

Recent actions in our upstream opera-
tions in Cameroon and Chad illustrate the 
benefits of Total System Cost efforts. An 

In Sakhalin, Russia, leading-edge technology was applied to drill extended-reach wells from the shoreline 
to the Chayvo field. This allowed for horizontal drilling under the sea floor and eliminated the need for a 
second offshore platform while minimizing and in some cases eliminating environmental risks.

More than 6.5 million work hours were 
devoted to remediation and restoration 
activities, which included the disposition of 
more than 100 sites for beneficial re-use.

phytoremediation technology. One method 
to effectively manage contamination is phy-
toremediation, which employs vegetation for 
the in situ treatment of contaminants in soil 
and groundwater. Although phytoremediation 
is considered an emerging technology, many 
in the regulatory community have recognized it 
as an effective, economical, and environmen-
tally sustainable method of site remediation. 
ExxonMobil is making progress in applying the 
appropriate use of this technology at several 
sites. For example, on a 30-hectare portion of 
a site in East Providence, Rhode Island, we 
planted more than 13,000 trees, shrubs, and 
native grasses in order to reduce contaminant 
leaching and to control erosion. 

Land conservation. Through our work 
with conservation organizations such as the 
Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and The Nature 
Conservancy, ExxonMobil continues to progress 
land conservation as a viable disposition option. 

Last year, we reported on remediation activi-
ties at two former fuels storage terminal sites 
located on Long Island, New York, whose 
operations date back to the early 1900s.  
In 2010, ExxonMobil began developing plans 
to restore the coastal habitat within the 
boundaries of these properties. In partnership 
with the LTA, EMES is identifying local land 
trust candidates for potential stewardship of 
conservation easements on these two proper-
ties. This approach would help to ensure the 
properties remain designated as conserva-
tion land in perpetuity, thus protecting these 
natural resources from future development 
and providing community benefits including 
environmental education opportunities.

initiative to consolidate shipments into larger 
40-foot containers rather than shipping 
many smaller-sized containers resulted in 
a 30-percent reduction in the total number 
of shipments, thereby reducing total fuel 
consumption and air emissions.

Within our Chemical operations, direct deliv-
eries of polyolefin products to customers in 
rail cars increased from 26 percent in 2005 
to 43 percent in 2010. This decreased the 
number of trips to rail storage yards by more 
than 5000, reducing diesel fuel consumption

by about 1.2 million liters per year—the 
equivalent of removing about 585 cars from 
U.S. roads.

Our efforts to improve supply chains 
extend to our own products and deliveries 
as well. For example, we seek to fill truck-
loads and optimize packaging to reduce the 
number of trips while providing associated 
fuel and cost savings.

case study

Natural Gas: An Abundant, Cleaner-Burning Energy Solution

The world faces multiple energy and environmental challenges. We must provide safe, reliable, 
affordable, and environmentally responsible supplies of energy in order to sustain and improve 
living standards for people worldwide. Given its abundance, affordability, and lower carbon profile, 
natural gas is already helping us to address these challenges.

By 2030, we expect natural gas to surpass 
coal as the second-largest source of energy, 
behind oil. In our Outlook for Energy, we 
project natural gas will satisfy more than  
25 percent of the world’s demand for energy 
in 2030, which represents about twice the 
amount used in 2000. This demand will be 
met through a major technological shift 
that has unlocked massive reserves in the 
United States and around the world. 

Powering a brighter, cleaner 
energy future
A major use of natural gas is as a fuel to 
produce electricity. Increasing natural  
gas use in power generation presents a 
very cost-effective and large-scale option 
currently available to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.

Compared to coal-fired plants, natural gas-
fired power plants can cut carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions by up to 60 percent. In addi-
tion, gas-fired plants significantly reduce 
particulate and waste generation, and virtu-
ally eliminate mercury emissions, while also 
having low emissions of nitrogen oxides and 
sulfur dioxide. 

Another benefit of natural gas-fired power 
generation is that it is competitive without 
subsidies or mandates. Moreover, where gov-
ernments adopt policies that make CO2 and 
other emissions more costly, natural gas will 
be even more competitive in the power gen-
eration sector, as compared to coal. Installing 
carbon capture and storage technology could 
also further reduce emissions (see page 35). 

Hydraulic fracturing
As the world’s largest public natural gas 
producer, ExxonMobil brings supplies 
of this cleaner-burning energy source 
to global markets in a safe, reliable, and 
responsible manner. As part of this under-
taking, we engage with stakeholders on 
a range of topics related to natural gas 
production and transportation. 

With the rise of unconventional natural gas 
and oil production around the world, one 
topic garnering significant media and politi-
cal attention is the industry-wide practice 
of hydraulic fracturing. 

Extracting natural gas from certain forma-
tions, including shale, tight sandstones,  
and coal beds, requires drawing the 
resource through openings about one 
half the width of a human hair. Hydraulic 
fracturing uses water pressure to create 
hairline fractures in rocks deep under-
ground so natural gas can flow. The 
amount of time needed to fracture each 
well stage is typically only four to eight 
hours, as compared to the weeks it can 
take to complete the many steps needed  
to drill a well.

Interestingly, hydraulic fracturing is not a new 
technology. Our industry has safely employed 
the technology as part of drilling more than 
1 million wells since the 1940s. What is new 
is the combination of the fracturing practice 
with other techniques, such as horizontal 
drilling and multizone stimulation. 

Addressing stakeholder  
concerns
Stakeholder groups have recently expressed 
concerns about potential environmental 
and health issues, including freshwater 
use, the migration of gases and hydraulic 
fracturing additives to groundwater or to the 
surface, and the handling of by-products. 
ExxonMobil addresses these concerns by 
carefully designing and completing our wells 
and rigorously managing the entire process. 

ExxonMobil chairs the American Petroleum 
Institute working group that has developed 
four best management practice documents 
encompassing the life cycle of unconven-
tional resource development. We work with 
state governments and multistate entities to 
address concerns, establish effective regu-
latory frameworks, and implement industry 
consensus on best management practices. 

Government and independent reports 
confirm that stimulating wells with hydraulic 
fracturing poses no inherent risk to water 
supplies. Part of this finding has to do with 
the fact that natural gas resources are sepa-
rated from groundwater by thousands of feet 
of impermeable rock. Still, our industry takes 
extra precautions to protect and conserve 
water supplies. 

Protecting fresh water
Water supply, especially in water-stressed 
regions, is an environmental issue of growing 
importance and one ExxonMobil takes seri-
ously. Hydraulic fracturing requires fresh 
water, though not nearly as much as other 

exxonMobil and xto energy inc. merger

The merger of ExxonMobil and XTO Energy 
Inc. combines the strengths of our orga-
nizations to help us to further unlock the 
growing natural gas potential in the United 
States. According to the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, there are enough 

unconventional natural gas resources in the 
United States to meet the country’s needs 
for 100 years at current consumption rates. 

This is great news for America’s energy 
security and the economy. Natural gas 
production generates jobs and revenues 

for local, state, and federal governments. In 
2008, natural gas contributed $385 billion 
to the U.S. economy and supported nearly 
3 million American jobs.

energy production operations. Compared 
to coal production, hydraulic fracturing uses 
about one-tenth the amount of water. 

To minimize environmental impacts and 
burden on local water infrastructure, 
ExxonMobil is using increasing amounts 
of recycled water. In 2011, our operations 
in the Marcellus region in the northeast-
ern United States will expand the use of 
recycling produced water in our fracturing 
process. In addition, pipelines will be laid 
where feasible to transport fresh water for 
the process. This will reduce the need for 
pits to temporarily store fresh water and 
will reduce truck traffic. In all cases, we 
appropriately treat or dispose of remain-
ing by-products according to local, state, 
and federal regulations. Additionally, all of 
our drilling rigs in the Marcellus region use 
closed loop drilling fluid systems. These 
systems eliminate drilling pits, reducing the 
overall site footprint.

With reports of potential contaminants in 
drinking water sources, the use of additives 
in hydraulic fracturing fluids has been a 
focal point of debate. ExxonMobil’s natural 
gas production operations use the smallest 
proportion of fluid additives needed to be 
safe and effective. Fracturing fluids typically 
used in our operations contain approximately 
99.5 percent water and sand, and 0.5 percent 
special purpose additives. These ingredients 
are necessary to reduce friction, prevent 
bacterial growth, and minimize scale forma-
tion that can corrode pipes. 

A vital component of building community 
trust is transparency of operations. We 
support the disclosure of the ingredients 
used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, including 
on a site-specific basis. We work with indus-
try associations to provide regulators and 
first responders the information they require 
about fracturing ingredients. We also partici-
pate in the state-based national database for 
fracturing fluid ingredients jointly sponsored 
by the Ground Water Protection Council 
and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact 
Commission. This database is now available 
to the public and provides a transparent, 
consolidated source of information across 
industry on a site-by-site basis.

Addressing the risks of climate change will require significant efforts by industry, government, and 
society. Expanding energy supplies to meet global demand while developing technologies that reduce 
GHG emissions are among the world’s greatest challenges.

At ExxonMobil, our strategy to reduce GHG 
emissions is focused on increasing energy 
efficiency in the short term, implementing 
proven emission-reducing technologies in 
the near and medium term, and developing 
breakthrough, game-changing technologies 
for the long term. Technological innovation 
will play a central role in our ability to increase 
supply, improve efficiency, and reduce emis-
sions. Approximately 90 percent of the GHG 
emissions generated by petroleum prod-
ucts are released when customers use our 
products, and the remaining 10 percent are 
generated by industry operations.1 Therefore, 
technology is also needed to reduce energy-
related emissions by end users.

Mitigating operational greenhouse 
gas emissions
In our operations, we focus on five key levers 
to reduce GHG emissions: flare reduction, 
energy efficiency, cogeneration of power and 
steam, carbon capture and storage (CCS), 
and production efficiency. Since 2006, we 
have invested $1.6 billion in activities that 

improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG 
emissions. In addition, we have invested 
over $5 billion in gas utilization and commer-
cialization projects to reduce routine natural 
gas flaring. 

Greenhouse gas emissions. In 2010, direct 
GHG emissions2 from our equity operations 
were 132 million metric tons. Indirect GHG 
emissions from purchased electricity and 
steam at our equity operations were estimated 
to be 15 million metric tons. After subtracting 
the equity GHG emissions from the produc-
tion of electricity and steam exported from our 
operations (included in our direct emissions), 
our net equity GHG emissions were estimated 
to be 127 million metric tons. This is an increase 
of about 4 million metric tons, or 3 percent 
from 2009. While increases from new projects 
such as liquefied natural gas production 
in Qatar and operations in Iraq increased 
GHG emissions by 5 million metric tons, we 
offset GHG emissions by 3 million metric 
tons through energy management and flare 
reductions. The remainder was due to normal 
variations in operations.

flaring. Hydrocarbon gases are naturally 
brought to the surface during crude oil 
extraction. In some instances, this associ-
ated gas is flared or burned, either as a safety 
measure or as a means of disposal. Gas is 
flared only when alternate options to utilize 
the associated gas have been exhausted. 

Commercial alternatives for associated gas 
require a business environment with the 
right conditions, including available markets, 
infrastructure investments, and appropriate 
regulations—currently not available in many 
countries. Reducing the amount of flared gas 
is an ongoing challenge for ExxonMobil’s 
operations in areas with limited infrastructure 
for putting the natural gas to beneficial use. 

In 2010, our upstream flaring averaged  
350 million cubic feet per day, a reduction of 
more than 20 percent from 2009 and nearly 
60 percent from 2006. We continue to seek 
opportunities to reduce flared gas as a means 
of decreasing our overall GHG emissions.

of flared gas, contributing about 70 percent 
of our upstream flaring. We continue to make 
infrastructure investments to improve gas 
management in these countries. In 2010, we 
achieved an almost 40-percent reduction in 
flaring in Nigeria and a more than 10-percent 
decrease in Equatorial Guinea compared  
to 2009. 

efficiency in exxonMobil operations. 
Producing fuel and petrochemicals requires 
significant amounts of energy. In 2010, our 
operations consumed approximately  
1.47 billion gigajoules of energy. Since 2000, 
we have used our Global Energy Management 
System (GEMS) to systematically identify and 
address operational efficiency opportunities. 

We remain on track to achieve our goal 
of improving energy efficiency across our 
worldwide refining and chemical operations 
by at least 10 percent between 2002 and 
2012. We have improved energy efficiency by 
an average of 7.5 percent in refining and more 
than 10 percent in chemical since 2002. At 
our Baton Rouge Chemical Plant in Louisiana, 
we are upgrading existing equipment to 
improve energy efficiency, reliability, and raw 
material flexibility. We anticipate the upgrades 
will be completed by the end of 2011 and will 
reduce annual GHG emissions by approxi-
mately 80,000 metric tons. At Beaumont, 
Texas, we constructed a steam line from the 
chemical plant to the refinery, where there 
is a demand for steam. The line will reduce 
annual costs by more than $1.5 million and 
will reduce GHG emissions by 21,000 metric 
tons per year, or the equivalent of removing 
4000 cars from U.S. roads.

In 2010, the four buildings at our Brookhollow 
campus in Texas received U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency ENERGY STAR Awards, 
the national symbol for superior energy effi-
ciency and environmental protection. Overall, 
the Brookhollow campus has reduced its 
total energy consumption by 27 percent from 
2007 through 2010, or by 13,320 gigajoules.

Our Global Real Estate and Facilities group 
has been working on a Green Assets initiative 
to minimize the environmental footprint of 
our assets by utilizing best practices from 
building standards such as LEED, BREEAM, 
and Green Star. The group also developed 
design criteria to reduce energy consumption 
in facilities in the United States, which are now 
being expanded internationally. 

improving efficiency in upstream oil sands 
production. Canada’s oil sands are ranked 
second only to Saudi Arabia in terms of 
recoverable oil reserves. We recognize there 
is concern among a range of stakeholders 
regarding the increased energy intensity 
and water use associated with developing 
oil sands. 

Oil sands crude has similar CO2 emis-
sions to other heavy oils and generates 6 
percent more CO2 emissions than the U.S. 
crude supply average for the full life cycle, 
according to Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates. According to Environment 
Canada, since 1990, Canada’s oil sands 
industry has reduced production-related 
emissions by almost 40 percent per barrel. 
We recognize there is still work to be done. 
ExxonMobil and our Canadian affiliate, 
Imperial Oil, are committed to reducing 
GHG emissions at our oil sands facilities 
by investing in the development of incre-
mental improvement and game-changing 
technologies. These technologies, coupled 
with cogeneration, can result in even greater 
emissions reductions.

At our Kearl oil sands mining project, we 
will deploy a new proprietary technology— 
paraffinic froth treatment—to remove fine 
clay particles and water from the bitumen 
and produce a product suitable for pipeline 
transport to market, eliminating the need for 
an on-site upgrader. Processing bitumen 
once, rather than twice (in an upgrader and at 
a refinery), reduces life cycle GHG emissions. 
We have also developed a new technology 
called LASER (liquid addition to steam to 
enhance recovery) to improve in situ oil sands 
recovery. The LASER technology allows for 
more energy-efficient and higher recovery of 
bitumen and will reduce the GHG intensity of 
this process by about 25 percent. Our cyclic 
solvent process, currently under development, 
is a nonthermal method for recovering heavy 
oil that could potentially reduce the GHG 
intensity of heavy oil production by about  
90 percent.

Using cogeneration in oil sands produc-
tion reduces our energy requirements and 
provides an efficient means for producing 
electricity and steam at the same time. 
Cogeneration planned for Kearl will reduce 
CO2 emissions by 500,000 metric tons a 
year, compared to purchasing electricity for 
the first phase of the project. Cogeneration 
facilities at our Cold Lake in situ opera-
tion reduced CO2 emissions by 40 percent 
compared with generating electricity from 
coal-fired plants and processing steam from 
conventional boilers.

Another important concern surrounding oil 
sands development in Canada is the impact 
of water withdrawal on the Athabasca River 
in Alberta. About 3 percent of the average 
natural flow of the Athabasca is allocated 
to the oil industry, half of which is used. At 
our Kearl oil sands project, we are con-
structing a water storage system to reduce 
water withdrawal from the Athabasca River 
during low-flow periods. Kearl will also use 
advanced technologies to recycle water and 

reduce water demand. Water extracted from 
the Athabasca River will be re-used about 
18 times. Our Cold Lake facility uses half a 
barrel of fresh water for each recovered barrel 
of bitumen. To significantly reduce water 
consumption, approximately 95 percent of 
the water recovered from oil production is 
treated, recycled, and re-injected as steam. 

ExxonMobil and Imperial Oil are also pro-
gressing promising research on nonaqueous 
extraction. This emerging technology has the 
potential to virtually eliminate the need for 
water and thus revolutionize bitumen extrac-
tion recovery for oil sands mining operations. 

cogeneration. As an industry leader in 
cogeneration—the simultaneous production 
of electricity and heat or steam that can be 
used for industrial purposes—we have inter-
ests in more than 100 cogeneration facilities 
in more than 30 locations. ExxonMobil has 
interests in about 4900 megawatts of cogen-
eration capacity around the world—enough  
to supply electricity to more than 2 million 
U.S. homes each year. In 2011, close to  
400 megawatts of capacity will be added 
through the start-up of new facilities in 
Singapore and the Netherlands. 

carbon capture and storage. ExxonMobil 
has been active in developing and apply-
ing CCS component technologies since 
the 1980s. CCS is a process to safely and 
effectively capture, transport, and store CO2 
in underground geologic formations such as 
saline reservoirs, depleted oil or gas reser-
voirs, or deep coal beds. Through our natural 
gas operations in Wyoming and our equity 
interest in the Sleipner field in Norway, we 
captured approximately 5 million metric tons 
of CO2 for underground injection in 2010. 

Our LaBarge Shute Creek facility in Wyoming 
completed an $86 million expansion in 2010 
of the world’s largest carbon capture plant. 
The facility has the capacity to capture 
approximately 365 million cubic feet of CO2 
per day. The captured carbon dioxide is sold 
to companies for enhanced oil recovery, 
helping to extend the productive lives of 
mature oil fields. 

Improving customer efficiency
Energy efficiency—technologies and actions 
that enable us to do the same, or more, 
with less energy—is one of the largest and 
lowest-cost approaches to extend our world’s 
energy supplies and reduce GHG emissions. 
We believe gains in energy efficiency through 
2030 will reduce global energy demand 
growth by about 65 percent and will offset 
more than 75 percent of the carbon dioxide 
emissions that would have been expected 
without efficiency gains. 

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     35

In 2010, ExxonMobil completed an expansion of the world’s largest carbon dioxide capture plant located 
near La Barge, Wyoming. The expanded plant will help reduce GHG emissions and enhance oil production 
in the United States.

ExxonMobil’s customers include both busi-
nesses and individual consumers. Improving 
energy efficiency can benefit both. 

improving efficiency in the industrial 
sector. The industrial sector is one of the 
largest direct and indirect consumers of 
energy. Through 2030, we predict efficiency 
improvements will offset 60 percent of the 
demand growth in the two largest industrial 
subsectors: heavy industry and chemicals. 
ExxonMobil is proud to work directly with 
manufacturers such as Toyota and GE to 
help them develop more energy-efficient 
products for their consumers and to improve 
their own operational efficiency. 

Our Lubricants and Specialties business 
regularly engages with industrial custom-
ers to develop lubricants and oils that 
provide increased fuel economy, longer oil 
life, and extended equipment life. These 
products include:

•  Mobil SHC synthetic lubricants and 
greases—recognized for longer oil perfor-
mance cycles compared to conventional 
oils—help extend industrial equipment life, 
produce less used oil, and offer potential 
energy and replacement cost savings;

•  Mobilgear SHC XMP delivers optimum 
equipment protection and oil performance for 
extreme operating conditions associated with 
wind turbines; and,

•  Mobil SHC Pegasus delivers a high level of 
performance to a wide range of natural gas 
engines used for cogeneration and is one of 
the first gas engine oils to offer fuel economy 
benefits in this sector. 

improving efficiency for the individual con-
sumer. We actively support initiatives to reduce 
consumer emissions from the use of our prod-
ucts in the transportation sector. To improve 
the efficiency of the global vehicle fleet, 
ExxonMobil is working with external partners 
such as automobile and tire manufacturers.  

doha carbon and energy forum

In late 2010, approximately 150 experts 
from internationally renowned academic, 
industrial, and governmental institutions 
convened at the Doha Carbon and Energy 
Forum in Qatar to discuss the challenge 
of increased energy use, finite energy 
reserves, and the impact of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The event was organized 
by the Qatar Foundation for Education, 
Science, and Community Development; 
Qatar Petroleum; and ExxonMobil Qatar 
Inc. The forum reviewed recommenda-
tions on current, emerging, and innovative 
technologies relevant to Qatar and the 
Gulf region. It is anticipated that the Qatar 
Foundation-Energy and Environment 
Research Institute will follow up on the 
recommendations of the forum.

portation-related GHG emissions (see below). 

Algae-based biofuels may provide an attrac-
tive option that could be used to supplement 
petroleum fuels within the current supply and 
use system and with the existing vehicle fleet.

Investing in long-term scientific 
research
ExxonMobil is investing in long-term scientific 
research that may have transformative poten-
tial for the economy and the environment. 

Global Climate and Energy Project. In 2002, 
ExxonMobil made a long-term research com-
mitment by becoming a founding sponsor 
of the Global Climate and Energy Project 
(GCEP) at Stanford University in California. 
We have since contributed more than half of 
our $100 million commitment to the program. 
This pioneering research program is focused 
on identifying breakthrough energy tech-
nologies that reduce GHG emissions and 
that could be developed on a large scale 
within a 10- to 50-year time frame. GCEP has 
sponsored more than 66 research programs 
at 27 institutions in Australia, Europe, Japan, 
and the United States. 

advancing renewable biofuels. ExxonMobil 
is focused on improving the efficient supply 
of current energy sources, such as oil and 
natural gas, while developing potential 
new sources, such as biofuels from algae. 

In 2009, we announced our collaboration with 
Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI) to research 
algae-based biofuels. This research and 
development program is a long-term effort, 
and if milestones are successfully met, we 
expect to invest more than $600 million. 

In 2010, we commissioned a new green-
house research and testing facility in La Jolla, 
California, to supplement ongoing work in the 
laboratory. In the greenhouse, scientists and 
engineers are experimenting with different 
algae growth systems, light levels, temperature 
conditions, and carbon dioxide and nutrient 
concentrations in a setting that more closely 
reflects real-world conditions. This will help us 
better evaluate whether large-scale volumes 
of affordable biofuel can be made from algae. 

Because scientists are using both naturally 
occurring and engineered strains of algae to 
identify optimal characteristics for growth, 
harvesting, and bio-oil recovery, environmental 
considerations and safety were factored into 
the design and construction of the greenhouse. 
The facility is built in a secure area of the SGI 
campus and has containment and treatment 
systems for all greenhouse waste streams.

Alternative fuel 
research could 
make fuels more 
available and  
affordable with 
lower life cycle GHG 
emissions.

Strong, light-
weight plastics 
help reduce vehicle 
weight. For every 
10-percent drop in 
vehicle weight, fuel 
economy improves 
by ~7 percent.

Advanced tire 
lining technology 
keeps tires properly 
inflated longer. Cars 
with properly inflated 
tires may save up to 
an extra tank of gas 
annually.

Algae-based biofuels present potential 
environmental benefits compared to other 
biofuels. At the La Jolla testing facility, algae 
are cultivated in salt water drawn from the 
nearby Pacific Ocean. A commercial algae-
growing and algae-harvesting farm could use 
land and water unsuitable for crops, eliminat-
ing competition for acreage or fresh water 
intended for human or agricultural use.

Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In 2010, one 
of our scientists participated as a reviewer 
in an IPCC report on renewable energy 
technologies and organized a workshop to 
provide industry input to the IPCC on this 
report. We work with legislative and regula-
tory processes around the globe to assist in 
the design of practical, cost-effective ways 
to implement climate policies. 

The next phase of our project is to build a 
larger testing facility in an outdoor setting; work 
on this phase has already begun. Successful 
research could create an integrated system 
where algae, fed on CO2 captured from a 
large stationary source, would then be refined 
into a variety of transportation fuels.

Public policy debate
A number of countries have adopted, or 
are considering the adoption of, regula-
tory frameworks to reduce GHG emissions, 
including cap and trade regimes, carbon 
taxes, increased efficiency standards, and 
incentives or mandates for renewable energy. 
Assessing policy options to reduce emis-
sions requires an understanding of their likely 
effectiveness, scale, and cost, as well as 
their implications for economic growth and 
quality of life. While the final determination 
and timing of policy belongs to governments, 
ExxonMobil is—and will continue to be—a 
constructive participant in these discussions. 

Our scientists, engineers, and managers 
participate in research and assessment 
activities, such as the Intergovernmental 

Effective public policy should promote inno-
vation, encourage competition, set goals, and 
provide a broad framework for entrepreneurs 
and innovators to achieve these goals. When 
considering policy options, ExxonMobil advo-
cates an approach that:

•  Ensures a uniform and predictable cost of 
carbon across the economy;

•  Lets market prices drive the selection of 
solutions;

•  Maximizes transparency to companies 
and consumers;

•  Reduces administrative complexity;

•  Promotes global participation; and,

•  Is easily adjusted to future developments 
in climate science and the economic impacts 
of climate policies.

A well-designed carbon tax is better able 
to accommodate these key criteria than 
other alternatives, such as cap and trade. 
Importantly, a carbon tax can be made 
revenue-neutral via tax offsets in other areas. 
Combined with further advances in energy 
efficiency and new technologies spurred by 

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     37

market innovation, such a carbon tax could 
play a significant role in addressing the chal-
lenge of rising GHG emissions. International 
accords and underlying regional and national 
regulations for GHG reduction are evolving 
with uncertain timing and outcomes, making 
it difficult to predict their business impact. 
In 2010, we engaged in discussions around 
these issues with numerous governments 
and legislators from Australia, Canada, the 
European Union, Japan, Singapore, and the 
United States. 

We test a range of potential cost scenarios for 
energy-related GHG emissions in our Outlook 
for Energy (see page 6), which we prepare 
each year to assess the business environment 
and use in our investment evaluations.

Technology Management System

ExxonMobil pursues research into proprietary 
breakthrough technologies that will not only 
enhance existing business, but provide step 
changes in the Corporation’s competitive posi-
tion. Research and development of an energy 
breakthrough technology may take 10 to 20 
years, with up to an additional decade before 
the technology achieves widespread use. 

which must be completed prior to moving 
on to the next phase of development. 
Assuming the likelihood of passing each 
gate is about 70 percent, the probability 
of reaching broad deployment would be 
about 8 percent. A simplified version of 
this pipeline can be seen below for carbon 
capture and storage technology. 

ExxonMobil utilizes a Technology Manage-
ment System to steward this process. This 
system consists of several gates, each of 

For example, in 2011, we will begin testing 
our proprietary CFZ™ technology in a com-
mercial demonstration plant near La Barge, 

Wyoming. This testing will occur more than 
two decades after we received our first 
patent on the technology. CFZ™ technol-
ogy freezes CO2 and effectively separates 
it as well as other impurities, enabling us 
to process gas with high concentrations 
of CO2. The technology could both unlock 
vast new natural gas resources and make 
CCS more affordable and efficient.

Contributing to economic development in the countries where we operate is part of ExxonMobil’s 
business strategy. We focus on economic growth as a precondition for achieving development targets 
such as the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which encompass a full range of corporate 
responsibility issues, from environmental sustainability and combating HIV/AIDS to promoting gender 
equality and achieving universal primary education. 

Achieving sustainable impact is no small chal-
lenge, especially when faced with competing 
local priorities, high expectations of the pace 
of progress, and shifting political agendas. 
As a significant presence in many emerging 
markets, ExxonMobil works alongside a host 
of other actors to overcome the many barriers 
to economic growth.

Individual plans are customized for each 
country to account for local factors such as 
regulatory requirements, business environ-
ment, workforce capability, supply base, and 
infrastructure. As a project progresses from 
one stage of development to the next, the 
National Content Plan must be reviewed and 
revised accordingly. 

National content
It is a business imperative that our pres-
ence contributes to the social and economic 
development of local communities and 
host nations. By establishing comprehen-
sive programs in the areas of workforce 
development, supplier development, and 
strategic community investments, we help 
to build capacity and sustain economic 
growth beyond the life cycle of our projects. 
Collectively, we refer to this approach as 
national content. 

A successful national content program 
requires long-term perspective driven by 
clearly defined and consistently applied 
management processes. National content is 
integrated into overall project and execution 
through the ExxonMobil Capital Projects 
Management System (EMCAPS). As part of 
EMCAPS, every new upstream project in an 
emerging market must develop a project-
specific National Content Plan. 

A plan consists of goals and objectives; an 
outline of the approach and requirements for 
workforce development, supplier develop-
ment, and strategic community investments; 
performance monitoring; and reporting. 

Our contractors also play a significant role in 
the execution of the National Content Plan. In 
many instances during the project phase, our 
Engineering, Procurement, and Construction 
(EPC) contractors drive much of the work-
force and supplier development. We ensure 
that our national content priorities are met by 
including requirements in our EPC contracts. 
EPC contractors are expected to execute 
these plans through their subcontractors.

Our National Content Development—
Guidelines, Strategies, and Best Practices 
Guidebook provides an overview of the key 
elements of a National Content Strategy 
and Plan; models and tools for the suc-
cessful development of national content 
components; and roles and responsibilities 
at the corporate, country, and project levels. 
This past year, we launched a new national 
content Web-based toolkit consisting of best 
practices, sample tools for national content 
implementation, and case studies. 

Workforce development
Workforce development is a long-term 
approach to recruiting and training that 
enables the Corporation to meet future staff-
ing needs and business objectives. Where 
applicable, we include requirements in our 

contracts for our contractors and suppli-
ers to hire and train a national workforce. 
We strategically implement development 
programs to meet local hiring objectives and 
overcome challenges related to availability  
of experienced candidates and in-country 
training capabilities. 

Local hiring. We have made significant 
strides in hiring host country nationals. The 
company uses a variety of best practices to 
support local hiring, including on-campus 
recruiting, campus recruiting focused on 
nationals studying abroad, employee net-
working, trade organization and Web site 
referrals, and external search firms.

In 2010, approximately 60 percent of our 
employees were located outside the United 
States. ExxonMobil expatriates (individuals 
working in a country other than their country 
of permanent residence) are deployed around 
the globe to share their expertise as well as 
train and mentor nationals for operational 
and leadership roles. In 2010, expatriates 
accounted for approximately 5 percent of 
our total workforce.

training and development. With careful 
attention to the job requirements of each 
stage of development, we apply global 
principles in a proven training curricu-
lum to address local challenges. Training 
typically covers ExxonMobil culture, ethics, 
and business practices; safety practices; 
environmental regulations; English language; 
skill-specific training; facility-specific training; 
work assignments and on-the-job training; 
and mentoring and coaching.

In addition to early career training, we 
provide corporate and technical training to 
employees throughout their careers. In 2010, 
our major business units together spent  
more than $77 million on training, reaching 
more than 61,000 participants. To strengthen 
our technical capacity, approximately  
35,000 participants attended more than  
3700 professional technical training sessions. 

Nearly 3300 employees at various levels of 
management participated in ExxonMobil’s 
leadership development training programs  
in 2010. Approximately 25 percent of par-
ticipants were women and 59 percent were 
non-U.S. employees.

Supplier development
Supplier development is a long-term invest-
ment of time, people, and resources to 
improve supply chain reliability, reduce costs, 
strengthen host country economies, and 
promote ExxonMobil as a partner of choice. 
We are dedicated to working with host gov-
ernments, nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs), and other stakeholders to develop 
local capacity. The focus on supplier develop-
ment begins in the early stages of the project 
life cycle and continues to evolve throughout 
the life of the operation. Our ultimate goal is a 
stable and globally competitive supply chain. 

To consistently develop local suppliers, best 
practices are institutionalized through our 
global processes. These practices include 
local supplier databases, enterprise centers 
for business development and training, 
tailored work scopes, supplier forums, and 
electronic bidding.

Another proactive approach we employ is to 
break down large bid packages into scopes of 
work that enable local suppliers to compete 
for—and win—small projects. For example, 
in Indonesia, camp management projects 
were divided into catering, maintenance, and 

pest control. As local contractors develop 
their capability and expertise, they begin to 
compete for bigger packages. 

purchasing from minority- and women-
owned businesses. Expanding opportunities 
for minority- and women-owned business 
enterprises (MWBEs) and local suppliers 
provides economic growth to local areas, 
expands our supplier base, and builds  
customer and supplier loyalty.

In the United States, our Supplier Diversity 
Program ensures that qualified MWBE suppli-
ers are included in our procurement sourcing 
process. In 2010, we made continued progress 
toward our goal of purchasing materials and 
services worth $1 billion annually from MWBEs 
by year-end 2012. This represents 7 percent of 
our total procurement-managed spending in the 
United States. In 2010, we spent $812 million, 
representing a 36-percent increase since 2006.

We are considering opportunities to further 
expand our program internationally in Australia, 
Canada, China, and the United Kingdom. In the 
United Kingdom, we introduced tools to allow 
procurement staff to more easily identify and 
work with minority suppliers. Access to diverse 
suppliers, defined differently by country, poses 
challenges as supplier diversity programs 
mature internationally. 

In addition to offering supply chain opportuni-
ties to MWBEs, ExxonMobil funds scholarships 
for suppliers to attend specialized programs at 
business schools in the United States. 

Strategic community  
investments
As we invest in communities, we pursue 
long-term projects with strategic goals that 
are aligned with global and social priorities 
as well as our business strengths. We seek to 
have a more meaningful impact by focusing 
the majority of our spending on significant 
challenges in the regions where we operate. 

best practice: workforce development in russia

Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) and its 
contractors currently employ more than 
570 Russian nationals, making up 80 percent 
of the Sakhalin-1 project workforce. As 
Russian national employees are trained 
and gain experience, they will approach 
90 percent of the workforce by 2012. A 
small local population, combined with a 
complicated economic crisis in the 1980s 
and 1990s that steered people away from 
geology, engineering, or construction, 
created the current competitive market for 
skilled workers. 

To successfully compete for national workers 
and meet its needs for skilled field personnel, 
ENL invests in the training and development 
of national personnel. In 2000, ENL started 
its own technician training program. After 
training three groups, ENL contracted PKT 
Training Services to create the Sakhalin 
Technical Training Center (STTC). 

All training performed at the STTC is mapped 
against a Competency Assurance Program 
that includes necessary knowledge, aware-
ness, and skills assessments. Today, the 
training programs meet Russian regulatory 

standards and are internationally accredited. 
The STTC facility provides on-the-job training 
as well as theoretical instruction and net-
working opportunities. In 2010, 41 trainees 
graduated from the program, bringing the 
total since 2000 to 167.

Our worldwide spending includes con-
tributions to nonprofit organizations as 
well as funds invested in social projects 
through various joint-venture arrange-
ments, production-sharing agreements, 
projects operated by others, and contrac-
tual social bonus arrangements. In 2010, 
Exxon Mobil Corporation, our divisions 
and affiliates, including XTO Energy Inc., 
and the ExxonMobil Foundation provided a 
combined $199 million in cash, goods, and 
services worldwide. Of the total, $119 million 
supported communities in the United States 
and $80 million supported communities in 
other countries.

Our signature programs address three 
long-term social challenges that directly 
impact the success of our own business: 
eliminating malaria; advancing economic 
opportunities for women; and improving 
education, especially in mathematics and 
science. Ongoing stakeholder engage-
ment helps us to identify local projects and 
partnerships that support our strategic 
investments. We believe that public-private 
partnerships are key to improving difficult 
social and economic issues. 

ExxonMobil Malaria Initiative. Ending the 
spread of malaria will require multiple 
approaches, including bed-net distribution, 
preventive education, and research into 
new and accessible treatments. Over the 
last decade, ExxonMobil has emerged as a 
corporate leader in the fight against malaria. 
Since 2000, we have made cash grants of 
more than $83 million to help fund malaria 
programs across sub-Saharan Africa. Our 
funding has allowed our partners to reach 
more than 39 million people; provided  
11.4 million bed nets, 1.6 million doses 
of anti-malarial drugs, and 820,000 rapid 
diagnostic kits; and trained 116,000 health-
care workers. Our funding also helped to 

Malaria is preventable, treatable, and curable. Research shows that when three-quarters of the people in a 
community use bed nets, the incidence of malaria infection decreases and the actual mosquito population 
is reduced by 90 percent.

develop three new pediatric anti-malarial 
drugs and gain acceptance for the first-ever 
malaria vaccine.

In 2010, ExxonMobil awarded more than  
$14 million to 21 organizations for projects 
across Africa and expanded our work into 
the Asia Pacific region, where malaria 
is also endemic. See the global citizen-
ship stories on our Web site for numerous 
examples of our specific contributions to 
malaria initiatives.

Women’s Economic Opportunity Initiative.  
Enabling women to reach their economic 
potential is a critical driver of social develop-
ment and progress. When women are able to 
generate and control income, they invest a 
large share of it in the health, education, and 
well-being of their families. This benefits the 
entire community. 

We focus on three key strategies to improve 
women’s economic opportunities globally: 
developing women entrepreneurs and busi-
ness leaders, creating a level playing field for 

women’s economic participation, and identify-
ing and deploying technologies to accelerate 
women’s economic advancement. In 2010, 
ExxonMobil made grants totaling more than 
$9 million—bringing our cumulative investment 
since 2005 to $41 million—to help women in 
88 countries fulfill their economic potential and 
drive change in their communities.

In partnership with Ashoka’s Changemakers 
and the International Center for Research on 
Women (ICRW), we implemented the Women  
/ Tools / Technology: Building Opportunities 
and Economic Power Challenge that identi-
fied 268 transformative solutions from 67 
countries to promote women’s economic 
advancement through technology. At the 
2010 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting, 
we announced $1 million in grants to support 
the expansion of high-impact, sustainable 
technology-driven business models identi-
fied through the challenge. One exemplary 
technology is a solar-powered drip irrigation 
system that enables women farmers to grow 
crops during a dry season. To further support 

best practice: supplier development in chad

Using local suppliers can be challenging 
where local business expertise has not fully 
developed or where safety and product 
quality standards have not yet been met. 
Esso Exploration and Production Chad Inc. 
(EEPCI) works to improve local business 
and operating performance. 

EEPCI conducted a major assessment of 
local supplier skills in 2006 and found signif-
icant gaps in accounting, risk management, 
human resources, and other areas. Together 
with the Chamber of Developing Enterprise 
and the Chadian Chamber of Commerce, 
EEPCI opened an Enterprise Center in 
2006 to address gaps observed during 

the supplier assessment. The Center rates 
suppliers for eligibility for EEPCI contracts 
and provides training to rated suppliers to 
improve their business and technical skills.

In 2007, EEPCI introduced an electronic pro-
curement system and has since trained more 
than 22 suppliers on electronic bidding, a skill 
that allows local suppliers to better participate 
in EEPCI’s bidding process. While preserv-
ing the integrity of the bidding process, the 
system facilitates the application process 
and checks for completeness and errors. 

Together with the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC), the Center developed 
strategies and programs with financial 

institutions to help local businesses access 
financial resources and demonstrate their 
ability to execute a contract. In 2010, four 
training sessions were held for 42 par-
ticipants. The training included the IFC 
small- and medium-enterprise training 
package, which addresses private sector 
management performance gaps and busi-
ness needs. 

To date, more than 300 small and medium 
enterprises have received training at the 
Enterprise Center. Chadian companies were 
awarded contracts for services totaling 
$110 million in 2010.

grant recipients, we are working with the 
Thunderbird School of Global Management’s 
Emerging Markets Laboratory to provide on-
the-ground business consulting support. 

We continue to support skills training for 
women entrepreneurs through regional 
businesswomen’s networks, which focus on 
expanding the number of women succeed-
ing in business and advocating for policies 
to remove legal barriers. Our partner, Vital 
Voices, has provided training, business 
exchange programs, and networking oppor-
tunities to 4100 participants in the Middle East 
and North Africa and more than 7000 women 
in sub-Saharan Africa. We will support the 
launch of a Latin America Businesswomen’s 
Network in 2011. 

To aid supplier development, we supported 
our partner Vital Voices in conducting a four-
day supplier diversity pilot program in Ghana 
for participants from our African business-
women network hubs in Cameroon, Ghana, 
Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda. 
Content included key steps for becoming a 
supplier to multinational corporations, and for 
implementing in-country supplier diversity 
training sessions and pilot activities in their 
home countries. In 2011, the African busi-
nesswomen network hubs will build on the 
2010 supplier diversity training by engaging 
with government and private sector officials 

to clarify their procurement processes and 
encourage increased purchasing from 
women-led businesses. 

education. Globally, a strong focus on educa-
tion empowers communities and builds the 
foundation for human progress. Healthy and 
educated communities also create a stable 
operating environment and a future pool of 
talented candidates for employment. Since 
2006, our contribution to education efforts 
has totaled nearly $421 million. In 2010, we 
directed nearly $110 million to education 
worldwide, of which more than $42 million 
was dedicated to math and science educa-
tion in the United States. 

pan-european math and science program. 
Our regional presence is a strategic advan-
tage that we employ to maximize the benefits 
of our community investments. In 2010, 
ExxonMobil designed a pan-European 
program to help students ages 15 to 18 think 
in practical ways about the energy issues 
they will face in the future. Partnered with 
Junior Achievement Young Enterprise Europe, 
ExxonMobil funds the Sci-Tech Challenge to 
encourage interest in math-, science-, and 
technology-oriented careers. 

The three-year, $839,000 program will reach 
approximately 10,000 students. In 2010, 
approximately 60 schools, nearly 150 vol-
unteers, and more than 1200 students from 
Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, 

applying national content best practices in papua new Guinea

We are applying best practices and lessons 
learned across our projects and operations 
to develop an effective National Content 
Plan for improving the economic and social 
well-being of Papua New Guinea. 

workforce development
Similar to our Sakhalin, Russia, operations, 
our strategy is to increase the participation of 
Papua New Guinean employees over the life 
span of the project, and to provide the neces-
sary technical and professional skills training 
for working on existing and future projects.

To facilitate implementation of this strat-
egy, the project is building several training 
facilities. The Port Moresby Construction 
Training Facility, which officially opened in 
2010, and the Juni Construction Training 
Facility will train up to 4000 students during 
the construction phase of the project. 
More than 400 trainees graduated from a 
temporary training facility in 2010, including 
84 women. To prepare for project start-up, 
76 individuals were recruited to attend the 
Production Operations Training Center in 
Port Moresby in 2010, including 20 women. 

A class of a similar size will be recruited in 
2011. Successful graduates will be prepared 
to operate and maintain this world-class 
liquefied natural gas production facility.

supplier development
The project supports the development of 
the local business economy through the 
purchase of goods and services in Papua 
New Guinea and by developing long-term 
supplier relationships. Through 2010, we 
had already exceeded our commitment to 
spend $450 million in Papua New Guinea, 
with local spending totaling more than 
$550 million. Local capacity is promoted 
by helping suppliers meet global stan-
dards, providing training for entrepreneurs, 
and creating business opportunities for 
local small and medium enterprises. In 
March 2010, the project opened a resource 
center to assist selected Papua New 
Guinean suppliers to strengthen their 
business processes and skills. We include 
requirements in our contracts with our 
multinational suppliers to prioritize the 
hiring of local firms, implement training, 
and execute a local business development 

program. Local suppliers must be finan-
cially sound, technically capable, and 
competitive in price and quality. 

strategic community investments
The project aims to improve living standards 
by investing in sustainable health, educa-
tion, and agriculture projects. As part of 
our National Content Plan, we are commit-
ted to spending $20 million on strategic 
community investment projects during the 
construction phase and $5 million a year 
during the production phase. Through the 
ExxonMobil Malaria Initiative, the project 
collaborated with the Rotarians Against 
Malaria Program on logistics, planning, and 
bed-net distribution. Project sites were also 
added to the National Malaria Surveillance 
Program and plans are under development 
for enhanced malaria diagnostics at relevant 
community clinics. More than 1000 commu-
nity members have been tested for malaria 
and were treated if positive. We are also 
working with Medicines for Malaria Venture 
to fund clinical trials of new anti-malarial 
drugs in Papua New Guinea. 

Norway, and the United Kingdom participated 
through online tools, national and regional 
competitions, and classroom events. Nearly 
1200 students completed the online quiz

focusing on math and science in the 
united states. Demand for science, technol-
ogy, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) 
professionals is rapidly expanding, yet fewer 
and fewer students are choosing to prepare 
for these important career tracks. In 2010, 
we continued to encourage students to study 
math and science through programs such 
as the National Math and Science Initiative 
(NMSI) and the Harris Foundation. Through 
UTeach, Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers 
Academies, and the Sally Ride Science 
Academy brought to you by ExxonMobil, we 
continue to give teachers the skills necessary 
to motivate students to pursue careers in 
math and science. For details about each of 
these programs, visit our Web site. 

We also introduced new partnerships and ini-
tiatives to further advance math and science 
in the United States:

Employee volunteerism and giving
In 2010, more than 24,800 ExxonMobil 
employees, retirees, and their families world-
wide donated more than 779,500 volunteer 
hours to 5500 charitable organizations in  
43 countries through company-sponsored 
volunteer programs. Of this, 12,500 partici-
pants donated more than 179,400 hours to 
more than 1200 organizations in countries 
outside the United States. 

Employees and retirees donated $38 million 
through ExxonMobil’s matching gift, disaster  
relief, and employee giving programs. 
When combined with corporate donations, 
ExxonMobil—together with our employees 
and retirees—contributed $237 million to 
community investments around the world.

Transparency
exxonmobil.com/transparency

promoting revenue transparency

With good governance and accountability, 
the value generated from natural resources 
can provide a better standard of living and 
increased opportunities for the citizens of 
host countries. As part of our commitment 
to honest and ethical behavior, ExxonMobil 
is an active participant in transparency and 
anti-corruption programs. Transparency ini-
tiatives are designed to increase disclosure 
of government revenues from the production 
of oil, gas, and minerals, with the goal of 
greater accountability by governments on 
how they spend revenues.

We support initiatives such as the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the 
Group of Eight (G-8) Transparency Initiative, 
and the United Nations Convention Against 

Corruption. EITI is a unique collabora-
tion among governments, companies, civil 
society, institutional investors, and inter-
national organizations. Together, we share 
the goal of implementing global principles 
that support improved governance through 
the verification and disclosure of extractive 
industry payments to governments and gov-
ernment revenue from those companies while 
protecting confidential company information. 

We provide assistance to our newest partners 
as they seek to implement greater transpar-
ency. At the same time, we recognize that 
transparency initiatives can only be sustainable 
when national governments have owner-
ship and responsibility. In 2010, Iraq joined 
EITI as a candidate country and ExxonMobil 

will serve on the Iraqi EITI Council. In Papua 
New Guinea, our project has the potential to 
boost the country’s gross domestic product 
and provide a catalyst for employment and 
further industry development. Project team 
members from Esso Highlands Limited are 
active members of Transparency International 
and acknowledge the government’s bilateral 
Memorandum of Understanding. Over the past 
several years, ExxonMobil has been active 
in the multistakeholder committee working 
to implement the EITI process in Equatorial 
Guinea. As part of that effort, Equatorial 
Guinea EITI published its first revenue report 
in 2010. However, Equatorial Guinea did not 
complete its required validation within the 
prescribed time period and was delisted by  
the EITI Board last year.

2010 Corporate Citizenship Report     45

ExxonMobil’s community relationships are an essential element of our global business. The quality 
of the relationships we develop with local communities has a direct impact on the long-term success 
of our activities.

Community impacts and  
relationships
Our approach to managing local community 
impacts consists of several core elements, 
including adhering to corporate policies and 
expectations (see page 22), applying national 
laws and universally recognized principles, 
assessing risks and opportunities, engaging 
with external groups (see page 8), and build-
ing local economic capacity (see page 39).  
At ExxonMobil, we call this socioeconomic 
management. This area encompasses 
several distinct topics, including human 
rights, labor and workplace rights, economic 
development, cultural heritage, land use, 
social and environmental considerations, 
treatment of communities and indigenous 
peoples, security, and relationships with 
host-country governments. 

For major upstream projects, the ExxonMobil 
Development Company applies its Upstream 
Socioeconomic Management Standard. 
As project teams apply our Operations 
Integrity Management System, the Standard 
provides guidance specific to key socioeco-
nomic issues that should be identified and 
addressed throughout the upstream resource 
development life cycle, including: 

•  Consultation with relevant communi-
ties, government officials, and appropriate 
stakeholder organizations to share infor-
mation, solicit feedback, and respond to 
expressed concerns;

•  Identification of potential issues includ-
ing, but not limited to, the management of 
cultural and heritage properties, interaction 
with indigenous or vulnerable populations, 
involuntary resettlement, compensation, 
employment and training, and the procure-
ment of goods and services; and,

•  Development of appropriate prevention 
(or enhancement), control, mitigation, and 
monitoring strategies related to potential 
socioeconomic impacts.

In 2010, the upstream companies formed a 
socioeconomics task force to assess current 
processes for planning and implementing 
socioeconomic management programs in 
new ventures. The task force developed 
recommendations to standardize and inte-
grate approaches, tools, and organization 
into existing business systems. One outcome 
was the decision to include Socioeconomic 
Principles to guide our approach in several 
social areas. We believe further refinement 
of the Management Standard will help our 

contractors, partners, and employees to 
better execute upstream projects consistently 
with our company values and, as such, help 
us maintain our license to operate. 

impact assessment and mitigation. We 
recognize our activities can impact host 
communities and other stakeholders. We 
strive to identify and avoid or mitigate 
negative impacts and enhance positive 
outcomes. At the start of major projects, an 
Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Health 
Impact Assessment (ESHIA) is conducted to 
assess the potential impacts of our activi-
ties throughout the project and operations 
life cycle. We consult with the public during 
the ESHIA process and integrate results into 
decision making, including impact avoidance 
and mitigation plans, and in some cases, 
modifying aspects of the project design or 
execution plan. 

Consultation and engagement
Wherever ExxonMobil operates, we work 
with stakeholders through consultation and 
act with respect toward individuals with 
diverse cultures. 

Our Best Practices in External Affairs (BPEA) 
initiative focuses on building positive external 
relationships and is integrated with our 
Operations Integrity Management System 
(see page 18). BPEA is our strategic planning 
and management tool for external affairs, 
which ensures implementation of consistent 
community awareness programs, including 
information provision, dialogue, and collabo-
ration with local communities. 

We believe engagement is a two-way com-
munication and recognize the need for local 
populations to be able to voice and resolve 
concerns related to a project without fear of 
retribution. Our Upstream Socioeconomic 
Management Standard includes provisions 
for establishing a grievance mechanism 
where appropriate. While our BPEA engage-
ments provide an important means to hear 
and address community concerns, griev-
ance mechanisms provide a systematic and 
transparent process for local people to raise 
concerns, which can be addressed by the 
company within an appropriate time frame. 

indigenous peoples and cultural heritage.
We value cultural heritage and customs in 
the communities where we operate and 
incorporate these considerations into 
project planning, design, execution, and 
ongoing operations. 

The Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas 
(PNG LNG) project area comprises a rich 
and diverse cultural mix of some 13 ethnic 
groups, 46 language groups, and more than 
400 clans. Most of these communities rely 
primarily on subsistence-oriented produc-
tion, maintain a close physical and spiritual 
relationship to ancestral territories, consider 
themselves as distinct lingo-cultural groups, 
and retain customary social and political insti-
tutions. The unique cultural heritage of these 
groups needs to be preserved for the benefit 
of current and future generations. 

As part of the PNG LNG project’s pre-con-
struction surveys, cultural heritage specialists 
conduct detailed studies in consultation with 
communities to identify areas and features of 
cultural and historic significance. This impor-
tant phase of activity is conducted before 
approval being granted for project access 
to potential worksites. In some cases, the 
project facilities were re-designed to avoid 
features. To date, pre-construction surveys 
and reports have been finalized for 95 sites, 
and third-party experts have identified more 
than 1400 mitigation measures.

Once a site is approved and access granted, 
pre-construction surveys are again conducted 
before work is allowed to commence on-site. 
These surveys involve assessing each work-
site, often with landowners, to further identify 
sites of significance such as burial grounds, 
sacred waterways, or areas containing 
artifacts. In populated areas, surveys include 
discussions with local people who are knowl-
edgeable of the area. For known sites, the 
focus of the Cultural Heritage Management 
Plan is twofold: to avoid those sites which 
are to be protected from disturbance, and to 
establish the process for the compensation, 
management, clearance, and salvage of sites 
that are authorized by the government for dis-
turbance. We work closely with the landowner 
or clan to determine appropriate mitigation 
measures, including customary ceremonies. 

In addition to known cultural heritage sites, 
construction activities can disturb or alter 
unrecorded archaeological finds within the 
project work area. The project has agreed on 
a protocol for managing the preservation and 
appropriate treatment of these finds with the 
Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art 
Gallery. The protocol deems that, following 
analysis and documentation, any material 
found is transferred to the gallery.

section, ExxonMobil’s approach is consistent 
with the basic components of this frame-
work. We look forward to reviewing Professor 
Ruggie’s final recommendations in 2011 that 
offer further guidance on how corporations 
can put the framework into practice. 

Labor policies and practices. Our com-
mitment to human rights is supported by  
the policies in our Standards of Business 
Conduct, which are consistent with the spirit 
and intent of the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the 1998 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work of the International Labor 
Organization (ILO). 

Our Statement on Labor and the Workplace 
articulates our support for the principles of 
the ILO Declaration, namely the elimination 
of child labor, forced labor, and workplace 
discrimination, and the recognition of the 
right to freedom of association and collec-
tive bargaining. All employees are required to 
comply with our policies. 

We seek business partners that observe 
similar standards. Our standard contract 
language requires adherence to all national 
laws and regulations. We prescreen suppliers 
and mandate compliance with all applicable 
laws regarding business practices and human 
rights. All requests for quotations include 
clauses relating to the prohibition of forced 
or child labor and the payment of wages in 
accordance with all local laws. 

providing human rights training. Our 
human rights training is based on 
ExxonMobil guidelines, practices, and 
priorities, and is informed by guidance 
from the International Petroleum Industry 
Environmental Conservation Association 
and other sources. Training materials are 
periodically updated to reflect new develop-
ments in the human rights arena as well as 
to incorporate feedback from trainees. 

The training focuses primarily on employee 
awareness, company policies and approaches, 
company resources, and our commitment 
to respecting human rights. Each session 
also includes information on the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights, 
the requirements of our Framework on 
Security and Human Rights, and the status of 
implementation of the Framework in the given 
country. Human rights and security training 
has been completed in 16 countries over the 
past three years.

In 2010, we continued to provide dedicated 
human rights training to key affiliates and 
staff, including lead country managers 
(LCMs). Human rights is a recurring compo-
nent in both quarterly LCM communications 

In Papua New Guinea, we are responding to community members’ requests to build a new walking path 
when our operations overlapped with an existing path.

Land use and resettlement. We respect 
property rights in the countries in which we 
operate. We strive to achieve free, prior, and 
informed consultation of impacted communi-
ties before we implement new operations. 
We seek to avoid resettlement through 
project design, and where resettlement is 
unavoidable, we seek to ensure appropriate 
restoration of livelihoods of displaced persons.

As a result of the PNG LNG project, we are 
currently engaging in resettlement activi-
ties. Resettlement may be necessary due to 
physical or economic displacement, involving 
the loss of shelter, assets, income streams, 
or means of livelihood resulting from land 
acquisition or obstructed access to economic 
resources (land, water, and forest). The 
PNG LNG project has made efforts to avoid 
resettlement activities wherever possible. 
However, when necessary, resettlement 
activities are conducted in accordance 
with international best practice, as defined 
by the International Finance Corporation 
Performance Standards on Social and 
Environmental Sustainability and the laws of 
Papua New Guinea. The project’s goal for 
resettlement is to give displaced people the 
opportunity to, at a minimum, restore their 
livelihoods and standards of living.

For communities where resettlement is 
deemed to be necessary, Resettlement 
Action Plans were developed based on local 
needs and circumstances, and in consultation 
with affected people. Customary land owner-
ship is perhaps the single most important 
feature of Papua New Guinean society. The 
complex portfolio of land rights defines social 
identity, group membership, and access to 
resources such as forest, power, and ritual 
status. This unique social organization pres-
ents some challenges with resettlement and 
often requires a case-by-case approach.

For project-affected households, a non-
profit Papua New Guinean law practice acts 
as an independent advisor with respect to 
their rights, responsibilities, and options 
concerning resettlement in the context of 
both national Papua New Guinean legisla-
tion and the project’s plans and provisions. 
This assists households to better under-
stand the resettlement process, particularly 
the valuation, compensation, and assistance 
options. The resettlement process also 
has a strong monitoring and evaluation 
component to achieve the project’s goal of 
livelihood restoration.

A total of 13 project locations were identified 
where resettlement is deemed to be necessary.

Respecting human rights
We respect human rights in our operations, 
not just because doing so fosters a stable 
business environment, but more importantly, 
because it is the right and responsible thing 
to do. 

We continue to participate in the consultation 
process outlined by John Ruggie, the United 
Nations Special Representative on Business 
and Human Rights. Professor Ruggie’s 2008 
report set forth a widely accepted policy 
framework for managing business and human 
rights challenges based on distinct yet 
complementary responsibilities for govern-
ments and corporations as well as effective 
remedies in cases of abuse.

The “protect, respect, remedy” framework 
outlines the duty of governments to protect 
against human rights abuses by third parties, 
the corporate responsibility to respect human 
rights, and the need for improved access to 
effective remedy mechanisms. Under this 
framework, the corporate responsibility to 
respect human rights involves due diligence, 
having policies in place, conducting impact 
assessments, and establishing mechanisms 
to track performance. As discussed in this

to addressing security concerns in Papua 
New Guinea, and reinforced the integration 
of these issues. 

Police deployed in support of the project 
have undergone training in the Principles by 
trainers approved by the International Red 
Cross. Complaints will be fully reported in 
accordance with the executed memoran-
dum of understanding and the Principles. 
Investigations will be led by the Royal 
Papua New Guinea Constabulary Internal 
Investigation Unit with oversight from the 
Papua New Guinea government ombudsman.

and new LCM training. Following an initial 
three-year implementation period, we have 
nearly completed training sessions in all 
priority countries identified on the basis of a 
variety of criteria, including the specific level 
of security threat, acute and dynamic issues, 
and external nongovernmental organiza-
tion (NGO) ratings. We are now assessing 
progress in each of the countries to deter-
mine follow-up actions. Training will also be 
provided on a wider spectrum to employees 
via a computer-based training module or 
other means. 

Addressing security concerns
ExxonMobil is committed to safeguard-
ing company personnel and property in 
a manner that respects human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 

Framework on Security and Human Rights. 
Since 2002, we have been an active partici-
pant in the Voluntary Principles on Security 
and Human Rights, a forum for discussion 
and information-sharing among extractive 
industry companies, governments, and 
NGOs. To help implement the Principles, 
ExxonMobil’s Framework on Security and 
Human Rights provides expectations for 
our majority-owned operating affiliates. The 
Framework includes guidance on working 
with host government security personnel, 
memoranda of understanding regarding 
host government-assigned security person-
nel, approaches for interacting with private 
security providers, and reporting and record-
keeping templates. Currently, 75 percent 
of our private security personnel contracts 
have been enhanced to include provisions to 
address human rights concerns. 

Human rights is a priority in our Nigerian 
operations. There have been security chal-
lenges and increasing tension in oil production 
communities in the country. To ensure the 
safety of our personnel and the communities 
around our operations, we actively advocate 
respect for human rights by government secu-
rity personnel, as well as by private security 
providers who secure our assets. In 2010, our 
security team organized two briefing sessions 
on the Principles for host government security 
forces assigned by the Nigerian government 
to our facilities. Similar training will be con-
ducted in 2011 as well. 

In Papua New Guinea, our project team 
works closely with contractors and the com-
munity on security issues. Project security 
challenges are systematically addressed  
in accordance with the Security Plan, which is 
regularly monitored and reviewed. A Security 
and Community Affairs workshop, held in 
mid-2010, provided valuable insight to all 
parties for maintaining a consistent approach

scope of the assurance. Lloyd’s Register 
Quality Assurance, Inc. (LRQA) was com-
missioned by Exxon Mobil Corporation 
(ExxonMobil) to assure the reporting 
processes used in the creation of the 
ExxonMobil 2010 Corporate Citizenship 
Report (“the Report”). The objectives of 
the assurance engagement were to verify 
the integrity of the processes used for 
determining material issues and for report-
ing, and to evaluate consistency with the 
following industry guidelines: 

•  IPIECA/API, Oil and Gas Industry 
Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability 
Reporting (April 2005); and,

•  API, Compendium of Greenhouse Gas 
Emission Estimation Methodologies for 
the Oil and Gas Industry (February 2004). 

The LRQA scope of assurance was 
limited to processes for the reporting of 
safety, health, and environmental core 
IPIECA performance indicators and 
ExxonMobil-selected additional indica-
tors. Verification of the accuracy of data 
and information was not included in the 
review scope. ExxonMobil has prepared

ing requirements against the applicable 
industry guidelines to assure consistency 
of scope, definition, and reporting for each 
of the relevant indicators;

•  A review of the reporting processes at 
Headquarters and at each of the functional 
business levels to evaluate the processes 
used by ExxonMobil to assure completeness, 
consistency, and conformance to reporting 
requirements across its global operations;

•  Reviews of the data-reporting processes 
at a sample of 11 selected operating sites 
to assess local understanding and imple-
mentation of reporting requirements. Sites 
include refineries in Slagen, Norway and 
Sriracha, Thailand; Australia Upstream; 
lubricant facilities in Paulsboro, New Jersey; 
Uddevalla, Sweden; Ulsan, Korea; Comma, 
England; Asher, Egypt and Alexandria, 
Egypt; a films plant in La Grange, Georgia 
and a chemical plant in Beaumont, Texas;

conclusions and findings. Based on the 
scope of the LRQA assurance engagement 
and the data and information presented for 
review, objective evidence was available to 
support the following conclusions at a high 
level of assurance:

•  Processes are in place that ensure 
sites contributing to core safety, health, 
and environmental metrics understand 

corporate reporting obligations and are 
included in corporate safety, health, and 
environmental reporting; 

•  The methods used for calculating  
each metric are clearly defined and 
communicated; 

•  Data collection begins at the operating-
site level and is ultimately collated and 
combined into Corporation-wide metrics; 

•  Processes are in place to ensure that 
the quantitative indicators are checked for 
completeness, consistency, and accuracy; 

•  Responsibility for annually reviewing and 
updating reporting guidelines is clear and 
improvement in methodology is regularly 
undertaken; 

•  Guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting are consistent with, and specifi-
cally refer to, the API Compendium for GHG 
Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and 
Gas Industry (February 2004); 

•  Active engagement with external stake-
holders provides feedback for determining 
material issues; and

•  LRQA believes the ExxonMobil report-
ing system is effective in delivering safety, 
health, and environmental indicators that 
are useful for assessing corporate perfor-
mance and reporting information consistent 
with IPIECA/API Guidance.

Observations and areas for potential 
improvement are provided in a report to 
ExxonMobil Management. These observa-
tions do not affect our conclusions.

as the ‘Lloyd’s Register Group’. The Lloyd’s Register Group assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense caused

LrQa’s competence and independence. LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on a rigorous appraisal of their training, qualifications, 
and experience. The team conducting the assurance of the Report was multidisciplinary and has been involved in assurance assessments from the outset of external 
verification of nonfinancial performance reports. LRQA’s internal systems have been designed to manage and review assurance and certification assessments. This 
involves independent review by senior management of the outcome derived from the process applied to the assurance of corporate reports.

independence of LrQa from exxonMobil. LRQA and ExxonMobil operate as discrete and independent legal entities. LRQA provides ExxonMobil with third-party attes-
tation assessment services to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. The assurance and attestation assessment services are the only work undertaken by LRQA for ExxonMobil. 

conflict of interest. LRQA is part of the Lloyd’s Register Group of entities. Lloyd’s Register Group entities recognize that potential conflicts of interest may exist that 
could impact on their independent assurance and certification activities. Lloyd’s Register Group entities are committed to identifying and managing such conflicts 
so that they do not adversely impact their independence and impartiality. To protect the integrity, neither LRQA nor any other Lloyd’s Register Group entity will 
provide services that create a conflict and compromise the independence and impartiality of third-party assurance and certification. The Lloyd’s Register Group 
entities will never verify their own solutions to a customer’s problem.
