2012 c o r p o r a t e   c i t i z e n s h i p   r e p o r t

Letter from the Chairman and CEO

Welcome to the 2012 Corporate Citizenship Report. 
Our commitment — to our employees, shareholders 
and the communities and countries where we work 
— to operate safely and responsibly starts with our 
planning, management and accountability systems. It 
flows from the expertise and diligence of thousands 
of employees and contractors around the world. 
Each day, it is their integrity, attention to detail and 
concern for the local communities in which they 
live and work that shape our culture of safety and 
drive our citizenship and operational performance. 
Their  efforts  —  and  commitment  to  continuous  
improvement — are what we highlight in this report.

Our Role
In the coming decades, society will continue to 
face complex challenges related to a growing 
world  population,  economic  growth,  climate 
change, food security and public health, among 
others. Most of these issues can only be tackled 
through effective dialogue and cooperative action 
between governments, business and civil society. 
We must recognize that none of the challenges 
we face can be addressed without reliable and 
affordable access to energy. Energy powers our 
offices and schools. It runs life-saving medical 
equipment and operating rooms. It manufactures 
vaccines  and  transports  medical  personnel. 
ExxonMobil’s role is to create the technologies 
and techniques to develop and supply energy to 
growing populations and economies — in a safe, 
secure and environmentally responsible manner.

Our Long-Term Responsibility
ExxonMobil is focused on the long term. Our 
projects — and their impacts — span generations, 
not business or political cycles. Our long-term 
perspective helps us focus on our responsibilities 
for environmental protection, social development 
and  economic  growth.  That’s  why  we  are 
committed  to  providing  our  employees  and 
contractors with a safe workplace, and we expect 
everyone to strive to reduce safety incidents. We 
discuss this culture of safety on page 37.

Our commitment to operating in an environmentally 
responsible  manner  is  anchored  in  our 
Environmental Policy. Our approach starts with 
gaining a thorough understanding of the local 
surroundings. This understanding is critical to our 
performance. We discuss this process on page 17. 

We also recognize the importance of understanding 
and managing the environmental and social risks 
associated with climate change. ExxonMobil is 
taking steps to reduce our own greenhouse gas 
emissions, investing more than $330 million this 
year alone, as you will read on page 30.

In the communities where we operate, we continue 
to work to foster responsible economic growth by 
partnering with international institutions to develop 
suppliers and train workers in transferrable skills. 
We discuss one such example in our Sakhalin case 
study on page 56, where decades of collaboration 
have led to increased local capacity.

Commitment to Performance
We have established systematic policies and 
processes to measure, monitor and improve our 
economic, social and environmental performance. 
Strong results require effective risk management. 
They require long-term planning, undeterred by 
the  episodic  ups  and  downs  of  regional  and 
global economic performance. They also require 
a relentless focus on operational integrity and 
best practices. As you will read in this report, we 
focus on long-term, incremental improvements 
that drive sustainable results. For example, we 
have used a variety of methods to improve safety 
performance, reducing our lost-time incident rate 
from 2000 to 2012 by 70 percent. 

In early 2013, ExxonMobil Pipeline Company 
responded  to  a  crude  oil  spill  in  Mayflower, 
Arkansas — a regrettable event for which we 
are deeply sorry. We responded immediately 
with a focus on community safety, restoring the 
environment and understanding the cause of the 

incident. When working to ensure operational 
integrity,  our  goal  is  to  manage  risk  to  avoid 
incidents such as these. But it is also important 
that if they do occur, we have the competency 
and the capability to respond and a process to 
integrate lessons learned into future operations 
to reduce the risk of reoccurrence.

Building Stakeholder Trust 
Industry must work to build stakeholder trust. 
With every new technological advance comes a 
renewed obligation to address public questions 
and concerns. That is why we must continue 
to  engage  with  communities  about  how  we 
systematically mitigate risk in our operations. You 
will read more about this engagement throughout 
this report. For example, the movement to unlock 
unconventional  natural  gas  resources  in  the 
United States has spurred economic growth and 
contributed to reducing the nation’s greenhouse 
gas emissions to levels not seen in 20 years. It 
has also prompted questions from stakeholders 
about methods industry employs to access these 
resources, and the proximity of operations to local 
communities. It is important that we continue 
listening to those who have a shared stake in 
this and other issues so that we can continue to 
build their trust. We look forward to continually 
improving our performance and contributing to 
innovation and growth in the decades to come.

We appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil, and 
we welcome your comments on this report at 
exxonmobil.com/citizenship.

$1.6 trillion

The International Energy Agency 
estimates that an unprecedented 
level of investment — an estimated 
$1.6 trillion per year on average — 
will be necessary to meet energy 
demand through 2035.

1.2 billion tires

ExxonMobil produced enough halobutyl 
rubber in 2012 to equip 1.2 billion passenger 
car tires with low permeability innerliners that 
help tires remain inflated at the recommended 
pressure longer.

U.S. homes

ExxonMobil produces enough 
natural gas globally each year to 
heat 114.2 million U.S. homes — 
nearly every home in the country.

2012 Corporate Citizenship ReportThe Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040

Each year, ExxonMobil takes a 
comprehensive  look  at  long-
term  trends  in  energy  supply, 
demand  and  technology  to 
help guide our own long-term 
strategies and investments.

The Outlook provides a window to the future. Over 
the next five years, ExxonMobil expects to invest 
approximately $190 billion in energy projects. 
The Outlook’s data-driven approach gives us 
a detailed picture of energy trends to guide our 
business investments over the long term.

Population growth fuels energy demand
Our  world  runs  on  energy.  It  is  fundamental 
to  our  way  of  life,  growing  our  economy  and 
improving standards of living. But the world is 
changing. An expanding population, economic 
growth,  new  technology  development  and 
changes in the nature and scope of regulations 
are all transforming the energy landscape. We 
are becoming more energy efficient and moving 
to cleaner fuels. At the same time, population 
growth, urbanization and expanding economic 
prosperity will drive demand higher, especially 
in Africa and Asia Pacific. ExxonMobil estimates 
that  energy  demand  in  developing  nations  
(non-OECD1)  will  rise  65  percent  by  2040 
compared with 2010, while overall global energy 
demand will grow 35 percent. The International 
Energy  Agency’s  World  Energy  Outlook  New 
Policies  Scenario  also  projects  a  35  percent 
increase in energy demand from 2010 to 2035.

around 1.3 billion people — or slightly less than 
20 percent of the world’s population — do not 
have access to electricity. Electricity generation 
represents the largest energy use across sectors, 
and this will continue through 2040. In addition to 
population growth, we expect urbanization to play 
a role in the growing energy needs through 2040. 
The United Nations estimates that the percentage 
of the world’s population living in urban areas 
will increase from about 50 percent in 2010 to 
more than 60 percent by 2040. An average urban 
resident consumes more electricity than his or 
her rural counterpart.

Today,  coal  and  natural  gas  are  competitive 
economic  options  for  generating  electricity. 
However, as costs rise due to policies aimed at 
addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
natural gas will continue to be competitive due 
to the fact that it emits up to 60 percent less 
carbon dioxide (CO2) than coal when generating 
electricity.  That  is  why  by  2030,  ExxonMobil 

Corporate Citizenship Report 2012

expects the implied cost of CO2 emissions to reach 
$60 per ton in OECD countries, and we anticipate 
global coal demand to begin a long-term decline 
for the first time in modern history.

Emissions reductions
Over the past decade, countries around the world
have been working to address the risks associated
with rising GHG emissions. Global emissions 
growth patterns are already changing — reflecting 
the  more  widespread  use  of  energy-efficient 
technologies and less carbon-intensive energy 
sources.  After  decades  of  growth,  energy- 
related GHG emissions are expected to plateau 
around 2030, despite a steady rise in overall 
energy demand.

Technology and trade
As  global  demand  increases,  advanced 
technologies  to  boost  energy  supplies  are 
becoming  more  important.  Thirty  years  from 
now, oil and natural gas are expected to meet 

about  60  percent  of  global  demand,  and  an 
increasing share of this supply will be produced 
from unconventional oil and gas resources and 
deepwater fields. ExxonMobil is developing new 
technologies to support the safe and economical 
development of these resources, which are not 
always located where energy demand is highest. 

International trade plays an important role in 
ensuring the wide distribution of energy around 
the  world.  Around  2025,  we  expect  North 
America will transition to a net exporter of energy, 
which  will  help  grow  the  U.S.  economy  while 
providing much-needed energy to other regions 
of the world.

2012 Corporate Citizenship ReportEngagement

Many people, organizations and communities are 
directly impacted by — or have a direct impact 
on — our business. Our engagement approach 
creates opportunities to provide information, as 
well as to listen to concerns, identify material 
issues  and  benchmark  performance  against 
expectations.  Issues  related  to  energy  are 
multifaceted,  and  our  stakeholders’  desired 
outcomes may not always align with each other 
or with the majority of our shareholders’ interests. 
Nevertheless, we will continue to participate in  
conversations with interested parties representing 
all points of view. The dialogue developed between 
ExxonMobil and our key stakeholders allows us 
to maintain the global perspective necessary to 
grow our business.

Countries in which we participate in the development 
of all major resource types and supply key market 
with high-value petroleum and petrochemical products

We solicit feedback and identify information gaps, 
strengths and weaknesses through a variety of 
mechanisms,  including  internal  and  external 
one-on-one and group dialogues and briefings, 
senior executive speeches, quarterly earnings 
teleconferences,  focus  groups,  community 
consultations, email communications and our 
corporate blog at exxonmobilperspectives.com.  
We  also  use  our  publications  such  as  the  
Corporate Citizenship Report, Summary Annual  
Report  and  our  shareholder  magazine,  The  
Lamp,  as  well  as  content  on  our  websites  to  
communicate with our interested stakeholders.  
In  each  focus  area  of  the  2012  Corporate  
Citizenship  Report,  we  include  examples  of  
how we engage with stakeholders.

External Citizenship 
Advisory Panel
In 2009, ExxonMobil created an External 
Assessment Panel to provide an independent 
review of our corporate citizenship reporting 
process.  The  panel,  comprising  leading 
academics, non-governmental organization 
representatives and socially responsible 
investors, reviewed and commented on the 
2008–2011 Corporate Citizenship Reports.

In  2011,  the  External  Assessment  Panel 
became the External Citizenship Advisory 
Panel (ECAP), with an expanded focus on 
providing strategic and objective advice  
on  ExxonMobil’s  corporate  citizenship 
activities.  The  ECAP  reviewed  an  early 
draft  of  the  2012  Corporate  Citizenship 
Report, and we evaluated this feedback 
and made revisions as appropriate. As with 
prior reports, the ECAP provided a publicly 
available  statement  summarizing  key 
feedback. For the panel’s statement on this 
report, visit exxonmobil.com/panelfeedback.

During 2012, the ECAP visited ExxonMobil 
Development Company’s global headquarters 
in Houston, Texas, to discuss social issues 
and  provide  feedback  on  the  Upstream 
Socioeconomic  Management  Standard. 
The  panel’s  feedback  encouraged  us  to 
continue to engage external stakeholders 
on this subject.

In 2013, the ECAP will visit ExxonMobil’s 
Upstream Research Company in Houston  
to discuss the Corporation’s approach to  
operating in the Arctic.

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report 
 
 
 
About this Report

Our 2012 Corporate Citizenship Report marks a 
decade of formally detailing our plans, progress 
and commitments that demonstrate our evolution 
as  a  corporate  citizen.  The  2012  Corporate 
Citizenship Report highlights our performance 
and approach across six key citizenship focus 
areas: environmental performance (see page 15); 
managing climate change risks (see page 28); 
safety, health and the workplace (see page 35); 
corporate governance (see page 43); economic 
development  and  supply  chain  management 
(see page 49); and human rights and managing 
community  impacts  (see  page  58).  Across 
these  focus  areas,  we  recognize  challenges,  
set  high  standards,  define  clear  metrics  
and  strive  for  continuous  improvement  by  
measuring progress.

Reporting standards and scope
This  report  was  produced  in  accordance  with 
the reporting guidelines and indicators of the 
International Petroleum Industry Environmental 
Conservation Association (IPIECA), the International 
Oil and Gas Producers Association (OGP) and the 
American Petroleum Institute (API) Oil and Gas  
Industry  Guidance  on  Voluntary  Sustainability 
Reporting (2010). The majority of these indicators  
are also consistent with the indicators used by  
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in the G3.1  
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. 

Increasingly, we receive requests for corporate 
citizenship-related information from customers, 
suppliers,  investors  and  external  ranking 
institutions. To help these stakeholders easily 
access this information, we have mapped relevant 
GRI and IPIECA indicators on page 12 of this 
report and at exxonmobil.com.

The  report  covers  ExxonMobil’s  operations 
from Jan. 1, 2012, through Dec. 31, 2012, unless  
otherwise  indicated.  The  report  uses  both 
qualitative descriptions and quantitative metrics 
to explain our policies, programs and practices. 
For  environmental  performance  data,  units

of measure are metric where noted. Financial 
information is reported in U.S. dollars.

Exxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates, 
with  many  names  that  include  ExxonMobil, 
Exxon, Mobil, Esso and XTO. For convenience 
and simplicity, those terms (and terms such as 
Corporation, company, our, we, us and its) are 
sometimes used as abbreviated references to 
specific affiliates or affiliate groups. ExxonMobil 
includes the above-mentioned operations as part 
of company performance data (see page 10).

The term “project” as used in this publication does 
not necessarily have the same meaning as under 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 
13q-1 relating to government payment reporting. 
For example, a single project for purposes of 
the rule may encompass numerous properties, 
agreements, investments, developments, phases, 
work efforts, activities and components, each of 
which we may also informally describe herein as 
a “project.”

Materiality
A critical step in publishing this report is ensuring 
that  the  content  accurately  reflects  the  most 
current  and  relevant  topics.  ExxonMobil’s 
materiality analysis process identifies economic, 
environmental and social issues of particular 
interest and concern to our stakeholders, our 
industry and our business operations. We identify 
issues  of  external  significance  by  monitoring 
stakeholder expectations and concerns through 
direct dialogue, public debate, legislation, media 
coverage, international agreements and feedback 
on our Corporate Citizenship Report.

In 2012, ExxonMobil assessed customer, supplier 
and investor questionnaires related to corporate 
citizenship performance as part of our materiality 
analysis.  We  also  reviewed  international 
reporting standards and expectations to ensure 
a  comprehensive, globally focused analysis. 
In  addition,  community  panels  —  such  as

Through our materiality analysis, we identify and rank issues of significance both to our business and stakeholders in 

the context of society’s sustainability objectives. This process helps us inform and focus the content of this report.

those  near  our  Baytown,  Texas,  and  Baton 
Rouge,  Louisiana,  refineries  and  chemical 
plants — commented upon the report. These 
comments were incorporated into material issues  
and improvements.

Material issues have or may present a significant 
current or future impact on our company. We 
determine priority issues by rating each issue 
based on its level of significance to stakeholder 
groups,  presence  in  the  public  domain, 
occurrence  under  international  standards 
and  frameworks,  strategic  importance  to 
ExxonMobil  and  potential  impact  on  our  
business objectives. Through this process, we 
are able to stratify the issues into three tiers, 
where tier 1 issues are most material. While this 
process continues to identify recurring issues, 
it also allows us to identify new and emerging

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report 
Managing Sustainability Issues

ExxonMobil’s primary responsibility is to provide the energy needed to sustain and improve standards of living for people worldwide, 
while delivering a return to our shareholders. But our responsibility does not end there. The size and scope of our operations mean 
that we become part of local communities and economies wherever we operate. We seek to improve lives and create opportunities 
throughout the world. We do this not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it helps create robust communities and 
stronger economies. This, in turn, is good for our business.

so that future generations  
are not compromised by actions 
taken today. By designing our 
approach to corporate citizenship 
around six key focus areas, we  
contribute to society’s broader  
sustainability objectives and

2012 Corporate Citizenship ReportPerformance Data

ExxonMobil collects data on a wide range of indicators to track performance.  We continuously work to 
improve our performance across our citizenship focus areas. This means assessing performance at many 
levels of the organization, from our operational sites to the business lines. We provide data interpretations 
where we consider the performance trend to be generally desirable (), undesirable () or mixed ()  
for applicable data. For certain metrics, no interpretation is necessary. For other metrics, we interpret 

trends based on performance over a multi-year period and consider other factors in our assessments, 
such as production volumes and economic climate. We conduct much of this detailed analysis at the 
operational level. When we see unfavorable trends at any level, we identify and aim to correct underlying 
causes. We describe in further detail within the text how we plan to address these issues. Starting in 
2011, performance data include XTO Energy Inc. information.

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report 
Key Processes and Management Systems

ExxonMobil seeks to conduct business in a manner that  
is  compatible  with  the  environmental,  social  and 
economic  needs  of  the  communities  in  which  we  
operate.  At  the  same  time,  we  focus  on  protecting  
the  safety,  security  and  health  of  our  employees;  
those involved with our operations; our customers; and 
the public.

Across ExxonMobil’s global operations, we rigorously apply management systems to enable high 
operational performance. We use these management systems to identify, track and report the metrics 
that demonstrate and guide our performance. These systems enable us to comply with regulations 
and, where laws and regulations do not exist, they provide a framework for maintaining our high 
standards. From the drilling of a well to the delivery of petroleum products, these expectations provide 
the foundation for managing risk and achieving excellence in performance in each of our business 
lines. Below is a partial list of our key processes and management systems, in alphabetical order.

•  Best Practices in External Affairs (BPEA) — Our strategic planning and management tool for 
practicing excellence in all community relationships. The BPEA process helps us identify specific 
needs, expectations and interests of host communities and aligns these needs with our community 
investment efforts. 

•  Controls Integrity Management System — A system for assessing and measuring financial 
control risks, identifying procedures for mitigating concerns, monitoring compliance with standards 
and reporting results to the appropriate operations and management groups within ExxonMobil. 
•  Environmental Aspects Guide — Provides guidance for identifying, evaluating and assessing 

the potential risks for various environmental issues.

•  Environmental Business Plans — A corporate-wide framework for addressing environmental 

requirements and expectations as part of the annual business cycle.

•  Environmental Data Management System (EDMS) — A system to collect, collate and consolidate 
site-level data at the corporate level to help manage our environmental performance indicators 
globally. EDMS is being integrated with existing site-based emissions monitoring and measurement 
systems to allow us to collect up-to-date, site-specific information.

•  Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS)  — Establishes common expectations for 
addressing safety, security, health, environmental and social risks. OIMS provides a systematic, 
structured and disciplined approach to measure progress and track accountability across business 
lines, facilities and projects.

•  Product Stewardship Information Management System — Applies common global processes 
and a global computer system to capture and communicate information on the safe handling, 
transport, use and disposal of our products.

•  Production Operations Energy Management System — Incorporates a systematic approach 

•  Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessment — A formal analysis to identify 

to energy management to improve energy efficiency in Upstream operations.

key risks and develop strategies to manage these risks through the asset life cycle.

•  ExxonMobil Capital Projects Management System (EMCAPS) — Provides a framework to guide 
project development and execution and facilitates the consideration of environmental concerns 
and regulatory requirements.

•  Global Energy Management System — A management system that rigorously identifies and 
addresses operational energy efficiency opportunities for the Downstream and Chemical business lines. 
•  IMPACt — A single corporate-wide database for capturing and analyzing safety and environmental data 
on incidents, near-misses, observations, assessment findings, lessons learned and follow-up activities.
•  National Content Guidelines, Strategies and Best Practices — Contains the key elements of a 
national content strategy and plan, models and tools for the successful development of national 
content, and roles and responsibilities at the corporate, country and project levels.

•  Project Environmental Standards — Establish environmental requirements for new projects, 
which  provide  an  additional  layer  of  environmental  and  social  protection  to  the  applicable  
regulatory requirements.

•  Standards of Business Conduct — Define the global ethical conduct of the Corporation and its 
majority-owned subsidiaries. These Standards uphold values related to human rights, labor, the 
environment and anti-corruption. 

•  technology Management System — Processes for technology investments that follow a gated 

management system from early technical innovation to final deployment. 

•  Upstream Socioeconomic Management Standard — Provides a combination of best management 
practices and minimum expectations for managing the socioeconomic considerations throughout 
the Upstream life cycle.

2012 Corporate Citizenship ReportKey Processes and Management Systems

Implementing OIMS
ExxonMobil’s disciplined management system, 
the Operations Integrity Management System 
(OIMS), establishes a common framework for 
addressing safety, security, health, environmental 
and social risks. Developed in the early 1990s,  

OIMS provides a systematic, structured approach 
to measure progress and track accountability 
across business lines, facilities and projects. At 
the global corporate level, the OIMS Framework 
is built around 11 Elements, each covering a key 
aspect of risk across the breadth of ExxonMobil’s 

operations. Each Element comprises a number 
of Expectations, 65 in all, that provide greater 
detail for each Element.

OIMS  Element  11,  Operations  Integrity 
Assessment and Improvement, describes 
the requirements associated with how each 
operating unit evaluates the extent to which 
it is meeting the Expectations of OIMS.

These two Elements are often referred to as 
the “book-ends” of OIMS, with Element 1 
being the “driver” and Element 11 providing  
the  feedback  mechanism  to  ensure 
continuous  improvement.  Elements  2  
through 10 address the more operational, 
day-to-day  aspects  of  OIMS,  like  Risk 
Assessment  and  Management,  Facilities 
Design  and  Construction,  Personnel  and 
Training,  and  Incident  Investigation  and 
Analysis, among others. 

In  order  for  the  11  Elements  and  
65  Expectations of the OIMS Framework 
to  be  consistent  and  relevant  across 
ExxonMobil’s diverse operational portfolio, 
each unit across the Upstream, Downstream 
and Chemical businesses has established 
detailed OIMS Guidelines. These Guidelines 
describe how each business unit addresses 
the 65 Corporate Expectations relevant to 
that business unit’s operations.

To address the Guidelines described above, 
and to satisfy the Expectations outlined by 
the 11 Elements of the OIMS Framework, 
every site or operating entity has in place 
a  number  of  discrete,  comprehensive  
Management Systems that provide step-
by-step  details  of  OIMS  execution  at  
the site level.

Reliable and affordable energy is essential to human progress. At 
the same time — like all industrial processes — energy development  
involves  risk.  ExxonMobil  considers  risk  at  every  stage  of 
development, and we continuously work to reduce environmental 
impacts.  Rigorous  standards  and  good  practices  that  consider 
the needs of the communities where we operate guide our efforts.

during the drilling program associated with our 
Point  Thomson  project  in  Alaska,  it  led  to  the 
identification  of  a  new  environmental  aspect: 
several polar bear dens were found near a project 
ice  road.  To  avoid  these  dens,  we  re-routed 
the  road  and  maintained  active  monitoring. 
Local environmental regulatory agencies have 
recognized this initiative.

In  2012,  we  screened  our  major  sites  against 
databases of the IUCN and World Protected Areas. 
We confirmed that less than 20 percent of our  
108 major Upstream, Downstream and Chemical 
facilities are within five kilometers of designated 
environmentally protected areas. As part of the 
Upstream ESHIA process for projects, we develop 
plans if elevated biodiversity or species risks exist.

 1.

Assessing 
our Surroundings

Our  business  spans  the  globe,  and  no  two 
operating  environments  are  the  same.  Our 
approach to environmental protection begins with a 
thorough understanding of local environmental and 
socioeconomic surroundings. This understanding 
is critical to superior performance.

Conducting impact assessments
For new Upstream projects, we conduct risk-
based  Environmental,  Socioeconomic  and 
Health Impact Assessments (ESHIAs) to identify 
community concerns, environmental aspects 
and social and economic conditions. We then 
apply an “avoid, reduce, remedy” strategy to 
address  potential  risks.  Our  goal  is  to  man- 
age  risks  to  the  lowest  level  practical.  This 
hierarchical mitigation approach ensures that 
we first consider modifying aspects of a project’s 
design or execution plan to avoid an impact.  

The ExxonMobil Environmental Aspects Guide 
provides  guidance  for  identifying,  evaluating 
and  assessing  potential  risks  for  various 
environmental aspects (defined as “elements”). 
We  then  analyze  potential  risks  for  avoidance 
and  reduction  options,  and  consider  practical 
alternatives  early  in  the  project  design  phase. 
When  we  applied  this  iterative  approach 

Protecting biodiversity
ExxonMobil  uses  a  systematic  approach  for 
protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services 
that  recognizes  factors  such  as  the  rarity  of 
individual species, their habitats, their vulnerability 
and their cultural value. Ecosystem services are 
defined as the direct and indirect benefits people 
obtain from the environment, such as food, water 
and recreation. Safeguarding the ability of the 
environment to provide important services is a key 
risk management focus for ExxonMobil.

We identify biodiversity protection objectives 
and consider ecosystem services through the 
ESHIA process, the preparation of Environmental 
Management  Plans  and  our  Environmental 
Business Planning efforts. We are continuously 
looking for new tools and analytical methods to 
better understand local biodiversity conditions 
and ecosystem services. For example, ExxonMobil 
researchers  developed  a  new  framework  to 
characterize marine environmental sensitivities 
by prioritizing ecosystem services depending 
upon habitat types and ecosystem components in 
the region of interest. During 2012, we piloted this 
framework in an analysis of the Gulf of Mexico. This 
pilot identified high-value ecosystem services and 
helped select appropriate monitoring indicators 
for  ecosystem  health.  Further  development 
work will involve seeking stakeholder input on 
the framework and sharing the good practice 
more widely.

Identification and Assessment 
of Environmental Aspects is

and  then  we  develop  strategies  to  avoid  or  manage  

those aspects.

We  also  assess  existing  environmental 
management  practices  to  safeguard  local 
biodiversity.  For  an  expansion  project  at  our 
Longford gas processing and crude oil stabilization 
plant in Australia, we conducted an ecological 
assessment that identified biologically diverse 
woodland areas in the immediate vicinity. To avoid 
disturbances from construction, we relocated 
some of the roadways in our expansion plans.

In 2012, we continued to roll out the Papua New 
Guinea liquefied natural gas project’s biodiversity 
offset  program.  Based  on  recommendations 
from Conservation International, and following 
extensive engagement with local organizations 
and communities, the biodiversity offset program 
was designed both to strengthen existing protected 
areas and establish new protected areas. In addition 
to  on-the-ground  conservation,  the  program 
includes a capacity-building component to further 
the conservation platform in Papua New Guinea, 
work at the regional level to support development 
of a regional protected area system, and work at 
the national level to support the implementation 
of Papua New Guinea’s commitments under the 
Convention of Biological Diversity.

We  seek  to  partner  with  non-governmental 
organizations  to  implement  biodiversity-  and 
conservation-related programs with measurable, 
scientific results. In 2012, ExxonMobil contributed 
nearly $1.3 million to organizations dedicated to 
biodiversity protection and land conservation. We 
also support organizations focused on improving 
the quality and quantity of species data, such as 
the United Nations World Conservation Monitoring 
Centre and NatureServe, to enhance industries’ 
environmental protection and planning.

By the end of 2012, we actively managed more than 
3,000 hectares of land for the benefit of wildlife at 
21 ExxonMobil sites, compared with 140 hectares 
in 2009. A noteworthy accomplishment in 2012 
was that the Kearl site, located in Canada, received 
Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) Wildlife at Work 
certification. ExxonMobil plans to continue engaging 
with WHC in the development of educational and 
outreach opportunities on company sites through 
a Corporate Lands for Learning (CLL) program. 
Currently, ExxonMobil has five programs achieving 
CLL  status  for  promotion  of  environmental 
awareness, biodiversity and science initiatives.

In 2012, we held the first ExxonMobil Wildlife 
Workshop  with  individuals  representing 
ExxonMobil projects, operations and contractors

Designing our Facilities
Wherever  we  operate,  we  follow  local 
environmental  regulations.  In  places  where 
regulations are not fully developed or implemented, 
we operate to standards that are protective of  
the environment.

Our ExxonMobil Capital Projects Management 
System (EMCAPS) provides a framework to guide 
project  development  and  execution.  EMCAPS 
facilitates  the  consideration  of  environmental 
concerns and regulatory requirements early in 
the project design and implementation process. 
We continue to develop Project Environmental 
Standards for each of our business lines. The 
standards focus on the most common types of

      Stakeholder Engagement: Biodiversity Protection

For more than 15 years, ExxonMobil has supported the Bioko Island Biodiversity Protection 
Program (BBPP) in Equatorial Guinea, in association with Drexel University in the United States 
and the National University of Equatorial Guinea (UNGE). The cultural exchange between U.S. 
and Equatorial Guinea professors and students extends far beyond the scientific scope of this 
biodiversity protection program. 

“ExxonMobil  recognized  early  on  that  the  BBPP  was 
effective in both saving the biodiversity of Bioko Island 
and in building capacity in rural communities and at UNGE.”

 — Dr. Gail Hearn, Drexel University

Bioko Island, located 20 miles off the Gulf of Guinea coast in West Africa, is considered biologically 
diverse, with critical habitat for seven species of endangered monkeys and four species of nesting 
sea turtles. These rare species are frequent targets of poachers and commercial hunters, but 
with ExxonMobil’s support, the BBPP deploys wildlife patrols to monitor the legally protected 
areas of the island through a monthly census. The ExxonMobil Foundation also provided 
funding to open the Moka Wildlife Center, the country’s first biological field station. The center 
hosts training sessions and wildlife research programs. BBPP’s efforts have also contributed to 
passing legislation that promotes conservation and bans the hunting of endangered primates 
throughout Equatorial Guinea. In 2013, BBPP plans to implement educational outreach programs 
for local school children.

environmental  and  socioeconomic  impacts 
associated with the oil and gas industry. As a part 
of the process, we studied existing and proposed 
regulations of a number of countries, as well 
as the environmental guidelines established by 
several international organizations, including the 
World Health Organization. These standards, 
which apply to new projects, can constitute an 
additional layer of protection beyond host country 
regulatory requirements and help ensure that 
we operate in an environmentally and socially 
responsible manner.

To date, we have developed standards in the areas 
of air emissions; flaring and venting reduction; 
energy efficiency; marine geophysical operations; 
socioeconomic management (see page 60); water 
management; drill cuttings discharge; land use 
and waste management. We assess our facilities 
every three to five years using our Environmental 
Aspect Assessment to verify that our standards 
are  being  implemented  and  to  facilitate  
continuous improvement.

Arctic resources
The  Arctic  represents  the  world’s  largest 
remaining region of undiscovered conventional 
oil and gas resources. Developing these resources 

presents technological, environmental and social 
challenges. ExxonMobil has a strong portfolio 
of assets and opportunities in a range of Arctic 
environments, some of which we have held for 
30 years or more. 

ExxonMobil’s portfolio of assets and opportunities is 

located in a range of Arctic environments. This map is 

representative of our assets through year-end 2012.

The company’s efforts in the Arctic begin by gaining 
a scientific understanding of the environment. 
For example, ExxonMobil conducted extensive 
environmental baseline studies in the Canadian 
Beaufort Sea to gather credible data to support 
our recent offshore seismic program. We are also 
participating  in  environmental  habitat  studies 
offshore Greenland that include whale migration, 
fisheries resource assessment, migratory bird 
habitats and understanding the impact of resource 
development on indigenous communities. Detailed 
environmental and fishery studies conducted in the 
Kara Sea, north of Siberia, during the summer of 
2012 included observations of marine mammals. 
In 2013, we also plan to conduct field monitoring 
for detecting sensitive coastal areas in the region.

Design and operational plans in Arctic locales, 
similar  to  everywhere  we  operate,  are  based 
on the goal of reducing adverse environmental 
impacts. On Sakhalin Island, our extended reach  
drilling  technologies  have  allowed  for  field 
development from land by drilling 40,000 feet 
horizontally under the sea. Extended reach drilling 
technology reduces underwater noise and limits 
our  offshore  presence.  We  also  use  special 
earthquake- and frost-resistant pipelines in some 
northern areas.

Operating with Integrity
ExxonMobil reduces potentially adverse 
environmental impacts by operating our facilities 
with integrity. Employees are expected to prevent 
environmental incidents and respond quickly and 
effectively when incidents do occur.

Freshwater management
In the communities where we operate, we evaluate 
how our activities impact water quality, availability 
and  demand.  We  actively  manage  our  water 
consumption and seek opportunities to reduce, 
reuse and recycle water in our operations.

The oil and gas industry requires water, including 
freshwater, in its operations. We use water in the 
extraction, processing and refining of hydrocarbons 
and for cooling at our facilities. Globally, agriculture 
is the major user of water at about 70 percent of 
total water withdrawals. Industry use (including the 
oil and gas industry) is less than 5 percent of total 
withdrawals, even in the highest income countries.

In 2012, the net freshwater consumption at our 
operations was 2,083 million barrels, representing 
an 11 percent decrease from 2011. We use a wide 
range of approaches to reduce water use and 
preserve water quality, including on-site recycling 
and water reuse, sourcing treated wastewater for 
use as process water, employing processes to 
decrease water needs and appropriately treating 
wastewater prior to its discharge.

In Nigeria and Germany, rain is harvested for use 
in preparing drilling fluids. During heavy rain days, 
up to 500 barrels can be collected, and in most 
cases, the rainwater accumulated exceeds the 
water amount needed at the rig site.

At the Cold Lake operations of our Canadian 
affiliate, Imperial Oil, we pioneered produced 
water-recycling  techniques  in  the  oil  sands 
industry in Western Canada for steam generation. 
As a result of this long-term investment, coupled 

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Environmental Performance

with research and the use of alternative saline 
groundwater  sources,  we  have  been  able  to 
reduce our freshwater-use intensity by 90 percent 
since 1985. We have additional conservation 
initiatives  under  way  targeted  to  continue  to 
further reduce freshwater use by 2014.

To reduce the potential impact on other water 
users, we compare our water usage requirements 
with availability during various seasons to identify 
sensitivities, associated risks and opportunities. 
We continue to use the WBCSD global water tool 
to identify regions where we operate that may have 
water scarcity concerns. Information about water 
stress and scarcity in the vicinity of our operations 
serves as an important part of risk management. Of 
our 108 major operating sites, we identified about 
25 percent operating in regions that may have 
some degree of water stress or scarcity. These 
areas are located in 15 countries. ExxonMobil 
performs this screening exercise each year after 
the WBCSD updates the global water tool with 
new sensitivity data. As a result, the company 
has a greater focus on water supply resources in 
Environmental Business Plans for each operation 
site, which take a five-year look ahead.

Wastewater management
Oil and gas production and refining operations 
produce wastewater that requires treatment before 
its discharge or disposal. Treatment methodologies 
range from the removal of suspended hydrocarbons 
and solids from produced water brought to the 
surface during oil and gas production to multi-
stage biological treatment systems for refinery 
wastewater. Regardless of the treatment type, 
we closely monitor wastewater effluent to protect 
local surface and groundwater resources. For 
example, the Baton Rouge Refinery has started 
construction of an advanced biological wastewater 
treatment facility that reduces total nitrogen loading 
by an additional 500 tons per year. This voluntary 
reduction will have direct environmental benefits 
on the Gulf of Mexico, where high levels of nitrogen 
over several years has created a dead zone, or an 
area of low oxygen.

Spill prevention
When assessing potential impacts to water or 
land, spill prevention is a top priority. ExxonMobil’s 
OIMS requirements help prevent spills by building 
in layers of redundancy, outlining procedures 
for the proper inspection and maintenance of 
equipment, providing comprehensive training 
materials for our operators, emphasizing regular 
performance of tests and drills, and allowing us 
to maintain a relentless focus on safety.

In 2012, we maintained our commitment to spill 
prevention and improved performance relative

ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company President Sara Ortwein and Qatar University President Professor 

Sheikha Abdulla Al Misnad sign a partnership between ExxonMobil and Qatar University to research industrial 

wastewater reuse technologies.

      Up Close: Partnering for Water Research

Technological advancements allow ExxonMobil to drive continuous improvement in mitigating the 
environmental impact of energy development. In October 2012, Qatar University and ExxonMobil 
entered into a year-long partnership to research industrial wastewater reuse technologies. In 
particular, researchers plan to study phytoremediation, a process using plants to clean and 
process industrial wastewater naturally in an engineered wetlands system. Treated wastewater 
could then be reused in non-potable applications, such as park or green-space irrigation. 

“Qatar  University  is  proud  to  contribute  research  that 
addresses Qatar’s need for increased water resources, and 
partnering with ExxonMobil in these efforts highlights the 
importance we place on the wider community’s needs in 
terms  of  water  reliability  and  sustainability. We  believe 
this research will contribute to the goals and objectives 
stated in the Qatar National Vision 2030 and the National 
Development Strategy 2011–2016.”

to 2011. The total volume of hydrocarbons spilled 
to land or water in 2012 was about 9,000 barrels, 
with nearly 40 percent recovered at the spill sites. 
The number of hydrocarbon spills greater than one 
barrel in 2012 was 24 percent lower than in 2011. 

In 2012, ExxonMobil continued implementation 
of  the  Global  Human  Factors  Best  Practice 
Guide  in  the  Downstream  business.  This 
Guide focuses on spill prevention by acting on  
human  risk  assessment  and  prevention 
considerations, including training, awareness 
and sharing lessons learned.

Marine vessel spill performance
During  2012,  vessels  owned  and  operated 
by  ExxonMobil’s  marine  affiliates  surpassed 
more  than  six  years  without  any  spills  to 
water.  Additionally,  the  vessels  we  utilize  on 
long-term  lease  had  no  cargo  or  fuel  spills 
for a third consecutive year. The marine fleet, 
which  represents  approximately  650  vessels  
in daily service, safely transported more than  
1.8 billion barrels of crude oil and refined products 
worldwide in 2012. Safe marine transportation 
involves  many  factors,  such  as  management 
policies  and  procedures,  crew  training  and 
competencies, vessel design and maintenance, 
port infrastructure and regulatory oversight. 

Offshore spill response
The first component of protecting the environment 
during offshore activities is preventing spills from 
happening. In the event of a spill, we work to make 
effective containment equipment and dispersants 
readily available.

ExxonMobil partnered with several companies 
in  2010  to  form  the  non-profit  Marine  Well 
Containment Company (MWCC) to develop a 
rapid-response  oil  spill  containment  system 
for the Gulf of Mexico. As part of this initiative, 
ExxonMobil continues to lead a multi-disciplined 
project  team,  in  partnership  with  nine  other 

21

exxonmobil.com

companies, to expand the capabilities of MWCC’s 
existing  containment  system.  This  specially 
designed  equipment  will  be  usable  in  water 
depths of up to 10,000 feet and can capture up 
to 100,000 barrels of oil per day. The expanded 
containment system, expected to be completed 
in 2013, will be able to process, store and offload 
captured oil safely.

Oil spill response strategies are designed to reduce 
environmental impacts to the extent practicable. 
Although mechanical recovery is favored for its 
ability to remove oil from the environment directly, 
this approach has limitations when responding to 
large offshore spills. Therefore, ExxonMobil has 
developed two new treating agents to aid oil spill 
response efforts. The first is a new dispersant 
that treats conventional oils with two-thirds less 
product than other formulas. The second supports 
the controlled burning of oil in icy environments.

Arctic spill response
As more of ExxonMobil’s opportunities are located 
in Arctic and cold weather climates, we developed 
a new training program focused on spill response 
tactics in these environments. In 2012, the course 
was offered in Edmonton, Alberta. Participants 
came from across the Corporation, including 
projects, operations, pipelines and corporate 
representatives  from  Canada  and  the  United  
States. While many of the basic oil response 
techniques remain unchanged, the addition of 
ice and frozen conditions creates a number of 
logistical and environmental challenges. Training 
such as this, along with participation in drills 
and exercises related to oil spill response, are 
key components of ExxonMobil’s emergency 
response framework. We have the industry’s only

dedicated, in-house oil spill response research 
program  and  have  led  several  joint  industry 
projects to enhance oil spill response in ice-
bearing  waters.  Most  recently,  ExxonMobil, 
along with eight other companies, formed the 
International Oil and Gas Producers’ Arctic Oil 
Spill Response Joint Industry Program. This three-
year, $20 million initiative will expand industry 
knowledge of, and capabilities for, Arctic oil spill 
prevention and response.

public safety and the environment. Each day, we 
transport about 2.8 million barrels of petroleum 
and chemical products through approximately 
8,000  miles  of  pipeline  in  11  U.S.  states  and 
the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  We  use  a  comprehensive  
integrity  management  program  that  guides 
us  in  operating  our  facilities  and  pipelines 
safely,  reliably  and  with  environmental  care. 
We regularly test and maintain our pipelines to  
detect corrosion and other integrity concerns. 
We patrol pipeline routes on the ground and in 
the air and closely monitor pipeline operations 
around  the  clock.  State-of-the-art  systems, 
alarms  and  other  technologies  are  used  to 
control and monitor pipeline systems. We work 
diligently  to  prevent  pipeline  incidents,  but 
in  the  event  of  a  pipeline  emergency,  we  are  
prepared  to  respond  quickly.  We  regularly 
communicate,  plan  and  practice  with  local 
fire and police departments to ensure that our 
response to an incident will be well-coordinated 
and effective.

In accordance with government regulations, we 
post our company name and 1-800 emergency 
notification telephone numbers on signs along 
the right of way for all buried pipelines at road 
and rail crossings. We also maintain a robust, 
documented  public  education  program  that 
includes biannual distribution of pipeline safety 
awareness  bulletins  to  our  neighbors  in  the 
communities  near  our  pipelines.  In  the  event  
of a significant incident, EMPCo may set up a 
hotline for community requests and go door-
to-door to help address community concerns.

Air emissions
We continue to seek opportunities to reduce 
environmental impacts from our operations by 
reducing air emissions.

In  2012,  our  combined  emissions  of  volatile 
organic  compounds  (VOCs),  sulfur  dioxide 
(SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) decreased by 

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report

nearly 8 percent from 2011, and has decreased  
42 percent from 2002 levels. 

Air Emissions
(millions of metric tons)

For new projects, we evaluate the purchase of 
equipment  like  gas  turbines  that  can  reduce 
NOx emission levels. At our Baytown Olefins 
Plant, we deployed enhanced programs using a 
“SMART LDAR” camera that detects leaks and 
other fugitive emissions sources. In its first full 
year, the site estimates a 10 percent reduction in 
VOC emissions. We have purchased additional 
cameras and are increasing use of them globally.

Waste management
Our first waste management priority is to avoid 
its generation, and then to reuse or recycle waste 
wherever possible. As a simple example, our 
newly designed work gloves offer better hand 
protection  and  can  be  washed  and  reused. 
Following  the  introduction  of  these  gloves  in 
Malaysia, conventional glove disposal dropped 
more than 85 percent.

The remote locations associated with our Papua 
New Guinea liquefied natural gas project pose 
waste management challenges due to the lack 
of  existing  acceptable  waste  management 
infrastructure. To reduce the amount of waste sent 
to project incinerators and landfills, we developed 
a waste disposal hierarchy and monthly waste 
metrics to visualize progress toward improved 
waste management. Every month, contractors 
prepare graphs showing the amount of waste 
landfilled, incinerated and reused or recycled. In 
2012, the Papua New Guinea onshore pipeline 
contractor employed a number of waste reduc-
tion and recycling measures, which yielded an 
80 percent decrease in the amount of expected 
waste for the year.

In  our  Fuels  &  Lubricants  business,  we  have 
undertaken a “zero net waste” program. During 
2011, we tracked waste data and set a baseline 
for major waste categories, including cardboard,

used oil, pallets and plastic. In 2012, we focused 
on a few pilot locations to identify waste reduction 
and disposition practices that can be integrated 
into site programs when the “zero net waste” 
findings are implemented globally.

In 2012, we safely disposed of 2 million metric tons 
of hazardous waste from our ongoing operations. 
Of  this  amount,  1.9  million  metric  tons,  or  
95 percent, was produced water, which is classified 
as a hazardous waste by only one local authority. 
Across all other countries where we operate, 
produced water is not classified as a hazardous 
waste and is usually reinjected using deep disposal 
wells or discharged offshore after having first been 
treated to remove residual oil to meet regulatory 
limits.  In  total,  we  reused  or  recycled  about 
60 percent of the hazardous waste generated  
by our operations (excluding produced water).

      Up Close: Environmental Sustainability 
      in the Supply Chain

We have made significant strides in improving supply chain environmental sustainability to 
make our business more efficient. Our Procurement Sustainability Network aims to align our key 
suppliers with our environmentally sustainable supply chain initiatives. In 2012, this group taught 
200 staff members about the importance of procurement sustainability and initiated a specific 
process to brainstorm improvements with key suppliers. We are planning to add environmental 
and social sustainability metrics to our strategic sourcing process to reduce our impact further. 
In addition, ExxonMobil Global Procurement is working with other large corporations to improve 
our understanding of methods to assess environmental compliance and social responsibility 
beyond first-tier suppliers.

Our strategic sourcing specialists are already identifying opportunities to procure more 
environmentally sustainable products. For example, we now purchase high-efficiency electric 
motors used to power pumps in our operations. There are hundreds of these pumps in many of 
ExxonMobil’s manufacturing facilities or chemical plants. Compared with conventional motors, 
these motors reduce electricity use by 3 percent and long-term costs by 13 percent. To date, we 
have purchased more than 1,000 high-efficiency motors for U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing sites. 

ExxonMobil’s Total System Cost philosophy drives the optimization of shipping routes for our 
materials and equipment. Recently, one of our key shipping suppliers, Maersk, achieved energy- 
efficiency savings and a 16 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions with an optimized 
supply chain configuration.

Drilling waste
Waste  at  drilling  sites  is  separated  into  major 
categories — such as chemical, organic, inorganic 
and  metal  —  to  be  disposed  of  or  recycled 
appropriately. When disposing of cuttings from 
drilling operations, ExxonMobil analyzes a variety 
of local factors to determine optimal techniques 
that  are  both  cost-effective  and  protective  
of the environment. 

We may send cuttings to designated landfills, 
grind and inject them into deep wells, or treat and 
discharge them into the sea. Before disposing of 
cuttings, we collect and analyze samples to confirm 
that we are meeting local regulatory criteria.

Compliance record
Our worldwide environmental expenditures in 
2012 totaled about $5.5 billion. This included 
about  $2  billion  in  capital  expenditures  and 
approximately $3.5 billion in operating expenses. 
In 2012, 80 penalties, fines and settlements were 
paid, which accounted for less than 1 percent

Restoring  
the Environment

Efficiently remediating and restoring disturbed land 
is central to reducing our overall environmental 
impact. To that end, we use a consistent approach 
that leverages ExxonMobil’s remediation practices 
around the world.

The ExxonMobil Environmental Services (EMES) 
functional organization remediates impacted soil 
and groundwater at operating facilities, inactive 
properties  and  formerly  owned  sites.  EMES 
works to enhance asset and community value 
and also supports new business development, 
while creating opportunities for the beneficial 
subsequent use of inactive properties.

8,000

cases monitored 
by EMES

In 2011, ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (EMPCo) 
experienced  a  breach  in  its  Silvertip  Pipeline, 
resulting in the release of an estimated 1,509 barrels 
of crude oil into Yellowstone River near Laurel, 
Montana. EMPCo entered into an agreed-upon 
Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the 
Montana Department of Environmental Quality in 
2012 to resolve civil and related liabilities under 
state environmental laws resulting from the July 
2011  spill.  Under  the  AOC,  EMPCo  agreed  to 

In 2012, EMES continued to monitor more than 
8,000 cases in its portfolio. Our remediation and 
reclamation activities included the disposition of 
nearly 2,400 hectares of land for beneficial use. 
Since EMES’ inception in late 2007, we have spent 
more than $3.8 billion in project activities and 
returned some 860 properties to beneficial use. 
EMES pursues its environmental stewardship 
mission with nearly 300 employees working with 
approximately 40 environmental consulting firms.

Workers at our Kearl development in Canada. In 2012, Kearl became the first oil sands mining development to 

receive the Wildlife Habitat Council’s Wildlife at Work certification.

For example, as part of remediation activities for 
a former Virginia-Carolina Chemical Company 
fertilizer plant, ExxonMobil developed a habitat 
reclamation  plan  to  return  property  back  to 
grassland and forest. The plant operated from 1897 
to 1932 in Blacksburg, South Carolina. Remediation 
work included reinstating a stream and wetland 
traversing through the site using native species, and 
improving water quality by installing a vegetated 
stream.  ExxonMobil  is  donating  the  13-acre 
site to the Town of Blacksburg for conservation 
use. The town is working with a local land trust, 
Upstate Forever, to develop the property for the 
local community to access for recreational use. We 
anticipate this transfer of property will occur in 2013.

In Baltimore, Maryland, a developer has begun 
construction  of  a  shopping  mall,  offices  and 
a  town  center  on  land  that  was  once  part  of 
our Baltimore refinery and products terminal. 
Operations ceased at the site in 1998, and at the 
portion of the property that will be developed, we 
have completed remediation activities, including 
product recovery, soil treatment and pipe removal. 
EMES is currently working with the developer 

to finalize additional construction plans, while 
upgrading a major city storm drain and working 
with the city and state on a planned light-rail 
extension. The first stores are planned to open 
in November 2013.

Technology
A combination of proven and new technologies 
is required to investigate, model and remediate 
impacted soil or groundwater. One of the ways 
EMES promotes technological advancement and 
stays abreast of cutting-edge developments is 
through financial support and active participation 
in the University Consortium for Field-Focused 
Groundwater  Contamination  Research,  an 
affiliation  of  eight  North  American  research 
institutes  that  collaborate  with  an  additional  
14 organizations around the world. At our Bayonne, 
New  Jersey,  facility,  we  recently  partnered 
with  a  researcher  to  test  several  innovative 
technologies to understand and quantify some 
of the fundamental natural processes associated 
with hydrocarbon migration and biological decay, 
and new methods to enhance the speed of the 
remediation process.

Environmental Performance

Another example of a technology application 
related to remediation is Imperial Oil Environmental 
Services’ specialized soil treatment facility for soil 
salvage and land reclamation activities in Canada. 
This innovative, technologically advanced facility 
accepts hydrocarbon-impacted soil from inactive 
sites and uses a bioremediation system to clean 
and rehabilitate it. Once the soil in treatment is 
determined to meet applicable guidelines, it goes 
back to the original site for use as backfill. This 
system has provided 47,000 metric tons of treated 
soil to nine remediation projects since 2008.

land conservation
Since 2002, ExxonMobil has engaged with the 
Land  Trust  Alliance  (LTA),  contributing  more 
than $500,000 toward LTA’s annual conference 
and general education programs. EMES also 
participates in an LTA work group to advance 
corporate engagement efforts related to land 
conservation. Through the application of natural 
land  management  strategies  and  proactive 
stakeholder  engagement,  EMES  continues  to 
consider land conservation as a viable end use 
option, which includes transfer of ownership to 

enact permanent environmental protection as a 
disposition option for surplus sites. This latter 
approach was successfully employed at two former 
waterfront terminals located along the Long Island 
Sound on Long Island, New York.

In 2012, ExxonMobil transferred ownership of 
our former Cold Spring Harbor Terminal along 
Cold Spring Harbor and Oyster Bay Estuary in 
Huntington, New York, to the North Shore Land 
Alliance. As part of this transaction, ExxonMobil 
also worked with the local Peconic Land Trust to 

steward a conservation easement to ensure the 
property was preserved in perpetuity as natural 
habitat and open space.

In a similar transaction, ExxonMobil, the Peconic 
Land Trust, the Town of Southold, New York, and 
the Village of Greenport collaborated to reclaim and 
preserve a former terminal property. ExxonMobil 
transferred the land to the Peconic Land Trust to 
oversee the reclamation, and donated a deed 
of  conservation  easement  to  Southold,  with 
Greenport as a party to the easement.

      Up Close: Site Decommissioning and Demolition 
      in Adelaide, Australia

ExxonMobil mothballed the Mobil Adelaide Refinery at Port Stanvac in South Australia in 2003 
and began demolition in 2012. By the end of 2013, demolition of above-ground infrastructure 
is expected to be completed. The site will then be remediated to a standard suitable for future 
industrial use. Preparation for demolition work of the refinery began in early 2010, and the 
property was transferred to the EMES portfolio. The project team includes experienced refinery 
personnel to assist with the decommissioning strategy development, validation of the plant 
condition, identification of associated hazards and preparation for demolition.

Following the closure of the refinery, ExxonMobil engaged a South Australian Environment 
Protection  Authority  (SA  EPA)-accredited  Site  Environmental  Auditor  to  oversee  regular 
environmental assessments of the refinery site and ensure there were no offsite impacts from 
former refinery operations, particularly on adjacent marine waters. ExxonMobil’s environmental 
consultants are collecting and analyzing samples from nearly 150 groundwater wells around 
the site, and they are monitoring the health of the offshore marine environment. Much of the 
work to assess the environmental condition of the site and prepare remediation plans will be 
completed following the demolition of the refinery.

In the meantime, ExxonMobil has entered into a Voluntary Site Contamination Assessment 
Proposal with the SA EPA, under which we have committed to carry out certain environmental 
assessment and remediation activities. We are taking every precaution to limit the impacts of 
this project on our neighbors and keep them informed of our project activities. We give periodic 
briefings to the local city council. We also regularly provide updates about our activities to the 
adjacent community by attending community meetings, publishing briefings in the community 
newsletter, sending out mailings and conducting in-person visits as necessary. Although we 
have not operated the refinery for many years, ExxonMobil has continued its contributions to 
schools and other community organizations neighboring the facility.

“Many corporations today  
have significant land holdings…
ExxonMobil recognizes the 
important role companies can 
play in our vital work to make 
communities healthy and  
vibrant places to live, work 
and play. As a founding 
member of the Land Trust 
Alliance’s Corporate Council, 
ExxonMobil’s leadership has 
been instrumental in helping  
us partner with other like-
minded companies interested in 
supporting land conservation.”

casE study
unconvEntional natural Gas dEvEloPmEnt 

It  is  in  everyone’s  benefit  for  the  industry  to  respond  to  public 
concerns and build community trust around the development of 
unconventional natural gas.

By 2040, we expect that natural gas will account 
for more than 25 percent of the world’s energy, 
and will have overtaken coal as the second-largest 
energy source. The economic and environmental 
implications of this shift are promising. For example, 
the switch to natural gas has already contributed to a 
reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the 
United States. In addition, in 2012, unconventional 
oil and gas production contributed $62 billion in 
federal, state and local government revenues in 
the United States, according to IHS Global Insight.

Yet high-volume hydraulic fracturing, which is used 
to develop unconventional natural gas, continues to 
prompt significant questions from stakeholders. It 
is in everyone’s benefit for the industry to respond 
effectively to these public concerns. Establishing 
trust with local communities and stakeholders 
supports a stable regulatory environment, which, in 
turn, allows energy producers, electricity providers 
and manufacturers to make long-term decisions 
about investments in new power plants, labor, 
energy efficiency initiatives and future production. 
These benefits can have significant economic 
multiplier effects in society.

In the past 60 years, oil and gas producers have 
employed hydraulic fracturing to access more than  

1 million wells safely and effectively. In recent years, 
combining hydraulic fracturing with horizontal 
drilling has enabled the energy industry to produce 
oil and gas economically from shale formations. 
These technologies and responsible practices 
used for drilling unconventional natural gas wells 
are the same as those used in conventional oil 
and gas wells, geothermal wells and water wells;  
these  practices  are  well  established  and  are 
effectively regulated.

Regulations and 
Responsible Practices
Stable regulatory frameworks, coupled with sound 
operational practices, can assure the public that 
unconventional natural gas can be developed in 
a safe and environmentally responsible manner. 
Experience  shows  that  the  most  effective 
approach to implementing regulations utilizes 
the knowledge and expertise of regulators who 
are familiar with the geological and environmental 
conditions in their home state.

States  have  regulated  hydraulic  fracturing  for 
decades in the United States. Nearly 99 percent 
of  all  natural  gas  exploration  activities  in  the 
United  States  take  place  in  27  states,  all  of 
which have permitting requirements that govern 

the  siting,  drilling,  completion  and  operation 
of  wells,  including  hydraulic  fracturing.  As 
the  development  of  unconventional  natural 
gas  continues  to  grow,  it  is  important  that 
state  governments  maintain  their  capacity 
for  appropriate  oversight  and  regulation.  For 
this  reason,  ExxonMobil  and  General  Electric 
initiated unconventional oil and gas training for 
state regulators and policymakers and are each 
investing $1 million to help regulators gain the 
most up-to-date knowledge to enable effective 
oversight as resource development grows.

In the Marcellus Shale region in the northeast 
United States, ExxonMobil and other members of 
the Marcellus Shale Coalition are developing and 
publishing guidelines covering key aspects of oil 
and gas development, including well construction, 
site reclamation, air quality and water management. 
These guidelines represent good practices learned 
from our drilling experience in the Appalachian 
region of the United States. For the past three years, 
ExxonMobil has chaired the American Petroleum 
Institute  working  group  that  developed  three 
recommended-practice documents encompassing 
the life cycle of unconventional hydrocarbons. A 
fourth guidance document, focusing on community 
engagement, is now being developed. 

Addressing Challenges Through 
Research and Innovation
Technological  advances  brought  us  the 
unconventional resource “revolution,” and industry 

continues to research and innovate to improve 
operations and address environmental challenges. 
A few examples of ExxonMobil’s engagement 
efforts in this area include: 

•  Collaborated on a major study (to be published 
in 2013) that provides precise measurements 
of methane releases to help guide improved 
policymaking;  

•  Used data from XTO for a life-cycle analysis 
of GHG emissions and water use (published 
April 2013);

•  Partnered with a major service company to 
explore substituting reused produced water 
instead of freshwater for hydraulic fracturing 
in certain basins; technical results indicated a 
potential net savings of an estimated 8 million 
gallons  of  freshwater  and  approximately  
1,400 avoided truck hauls of wastewater; 
•  Conducted research within the ExxonMobil 
Upstream Research Company to increase 
performance in hydraulic fracturing operations 
and reduce our environmental footprint;
•  Created  an  internal  scientific  team  to 
understand seismicity issues and facilitate 
the  development  and  application  of 
science-based risk management principles  
regarding this issue; members of the team 
have  discussed  findings  and  mitigation 
approaches  with  industry  colleagues, 
academics  and  government  officials  
in  Asia,  Europe,  South  America  and  the  
United States.

Key Public Policy Issues 
Water and Wastewater
Management
All industrial processes have risks, and the production of unconventional natural gas is no different. Stakeholders are concerned 
about how industry manages risks close to their homes and businesses, including those related to groundwater, methane 
venting, wastewater management, vehicle traffic and other related effects. We will continue to take a leadership role in 
working collaboratively with communities, regulators and industry associations to manage operational risks and address 
these questions and concerns.

Groundwater

Water and Wastewater
Management

Our industry has made strides to reduce the surface footprint of our operations 
and facilities, as well as traffic and sound disruptions. For example, directional 
drilling techniques enable us to drill multiple wells from a single location, 
significantly reducing the surface area required to develop this resource. To 
lessen traffic disruptions, we discuss truck requirements and schedules with 
local communities; for example, traffic required to carry equipment, materials 
and fluids to the site can use designated routes during specific hours of the day 
and week. To reduce noise, acoustic sound barriers can be installed around 
the perimeter of a drilling well.

Reducing 
Community Impacts

A typical well employing hydraulic fracturing requires approximately 3 million 
to 5 million gallons of water, which is equivalent to three to six Olympic-sized 
swimming pools. Although this amount of water is significant, shale gas is one 
of the more water-efficient sources of energy. For example, coal mining typically 
utilizes two to four times more water per unit of energy, and corn-based ethanol 
production often uses more than 1,000 times more water per unit of energy.

Where feasible, ExxonMobil recycles water to limit environmental impacts 
and reduce the burden on local water infrastructure. As necessary, we also 
lay pipelines to transport freshwater to our sites, which reduces truck traffic 
and the need for pits to store freshwater temporarily. In all cases, ExxonMobil 
appropriately treats or disposes of remaining by-products according to local, 
state and federal regulations.

Reducing 

Community Impacts

When  drilling  a  well,  we  install  a  series  of  protective  steel  piping  and 
cement  layers  that  create  an  impermeable  barrier  between  the  well  
and groundwater zones. Each layer is tested and monitored to ensure the 
well’s integrity throughout its life. When performed properly, fracturing fluids 
do not come into contact with drinking water reservoirs at any point in the 
process. In fact, hydraulic fracturing typically takes place thousands of feet 
below the water table — isolated from drinking water by multiple layers of 
impermeable rock.

Groundwater

One vital component of building community trust is transparency. ExxonMobil supports the 
disclosure of the ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, including on a site-specific basis. 
In the United States, disclosures appear on the publicly accessible FracFocus.org website. In 
Canada, the public can access FracFocus.ca for industry disclosures in British Columbia and 
Alberta. We are pursuing similar disclosure approaches in Europe and other areas where we are 
exploring internationally. In addition, ExxonMobil works with first responders in local communities 
to provide training and information in case of a spill.

Reducing 
Community Impacts

Since  local  groundwater  conditions,  geology  and  well  needs  vary  across  our  operations, 
we conduct risk assessments at every site, and then develop comprehensive, tailored risk  
mitigation  measures.  In  accordance  with  government  regulations,  our  industry  is 
conducting water quality tests within 2,500 feet of Pennsylvania drilling sites. In addition, the  
Marcellus Shale Coalition is developing a robust pre-drill water quality database. This first-of-a-
kind library will serve as an important environmental and public health tool to help address water 
quality challenges that have persisted in rural communities for decades.

to unlock canadian oil sands

ExxonMobil and Imperial Oil understand  there is concern among 
a range of stakeholders regarding the development of oil sands. 
Innovation  in  oil  sands  technology  underpins  our  ability  to 
continue to develop this resource safely and responsibly.

Canada’s oil sands are an immense resource, 
ranking third behind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela 
in  proven  reserves.  Future  development  of 
Canadian oil sands reserves will likely provide a 
measure of energy security in the United States 
and economic benefits throughout North America. 

Nevertheless, stakeholders have raised concerns 
about the development of oil sands, particularly 
regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land 
use, water use and tailings ponds. Our challenge 
as an industry is to ensure that we continue to 
move forward in developing this globally important 
resource in a thoughtful and responsible fashion. 
ExxonMobil and our Canadian affiliate, Imperial 
Oil, are developing and deploying incremental 
and game-changing technologies to improve 
efficiency and reduce environmental impacts 
at our oil sands facilities. Taken together, new 
technologies will enable ExxonMobil to produce 
Canada’s oil sands with about the same life-cycle 
GHG emissions levels as many other crude oils 
refined in the United States.

Oil Sands Production
Oil sands are a naturally occurring mixture of 
heavy oil — called bitumen — water and sand. 
Producers  use  mining  or  in-situ  extraction 
methods  to  recover  bitumen,  depending  on 
the depth of the reserves. For in-situ recovery, 

27

exxonmobil.com

producers  inject  steam  into  underground 
reservoirs that contain bitumen. The steam heats 
the bitumen and reduces its intensity, enabling 
it to flow and be produced. About 80 percent of 
Canada’s oil sands reserves are recoverable using 
in-situ techniques. The remaining 20 percent are 
shallow enough to be recovered through mining 
operations. The footprint of these operations is 
considerable, requiring careful environmental 
planning and management.  

New Recovery Techniques
Advances in technology are the key to economic 
and  responsible  development  of  oil  sands 
resources. Over the past 40 years, ExxonMobil 
has invested more than 2,000 work years in heavy 
oil research. These efforts include developing 
proprietary in-situ recovery processes, enhancing 
surface-related  technologies  and  creating 
technologies to increase the value of heavy oil 
and aid in its transport. In an effort to reduce 
our environmental impact further and improve 
efficiency, Imperial Oil researchers continue to 
deploy new inventions, including:

lASER: After more than a decade of research 
and  pilot  testing,  Imperial  Oil  is  deploying  a 
new technology called LASER (liquid addition 
to steam to enhance recovery) that involves the 
co-injection of low concentrations of pipeline 

diluent  (natural  gas  condensate)  with  steam 
into underground reservoirs. The diluent helps 
reduce the viscosity of the bitumen, improves 
the  bitumen’s  ability  to  flow  and  increases  
the  amount  of  produced  bitumen  per  unit  of 
steam. This leads to decreasing the bitumen’s 
GHG emissions intensity  by more than 25 percent.

Non-Aqueous Extraction (NAE): Scientists at 
Imperial Oil and ExxonMobil are working to reduce 
the amount of water required during oil sands 
mining operations. NAE could potentially reduce 
the use of water during extraction by more than  
90  percent.  NAE  also  produces  dry  tailings, 
facilitating early, progressive remediation. 

Continuous Infill Steam-Flooding: Imperial 
Oil  also  piloted  a  steam-flooding  technology 
to improve resource recovery in mature fields. 
Results from the pilot showed that the technology 
can improve resource recovery and reduce GHG 
emissions intensity for bitumen by up to 30 percent.  

Cyclic Solvent Process: This technology is under 
development for in-situ oil sands sites. The cyclic 
solvent process uses solvent instead of steam to 
produce bitumen. By eliminating the use of steam, 
the process significantly improves energy efficiency, 
reducing  produced-bitumen  GHG  emissions 
intensity  by  about  90  percent,  and  virtually 
eliminates water use. Imperial is constructing a  
$100  million  field  pilot  to  test  this  promising 
technology; it is expected to start in early 2014.

Paraffinic  Froth  Treatment:  The  Kearl  oil  
sands  mining  operation  in  Alberta  will  use 
proprietary paraffinic froth treatment technology 
to process bitumen on-site. The process blends  
the  bitumen  with  natural  gas  condensates  to  
create  a  diluted  bitumen  product  suitable 
for  transportation  directly  to  markets.  This 
technology eliminates the need for a traditional 
on-site “upgrading” process, reducing life-cycle  
GHG emissions.

Supporting Oil Sands Research
In addition to the research carried out at Imperial’s 
Calgary Research Center, Imperial Oil sponsors a 
wide range of energy research programs at Canadian 
universities and other institutions. Imperial Oil is 
the founding sponsor of the Centre for Oil Sands 
Innovation at the University of Alberta, which aims 
to conduct breakthrough research to reduce the 
use  of  water  and  energy,  thereby  reducing  the 
environmental footprint of oil sands development. 
During 2012, in another research endeavor, Imperial 
Oil, along with 13 other major oil sands companies, 
created the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance, 
designed to mobilize the best thinking, experience 
and technology available to deliver environmental 
improvements to the oil sands sector.

ExxonMobil and the industry as a whole have made 
and continue to make major technological strides 
in advancing processes, increasing efficiency and 
reducing the environmental impact of oil sands 
development. We recognize that stakeholders have 
concerns, and we understand the importance of 
ensuring that we do business safely and responsibly. 
We will continue to leverage technologies in order 
to find more efficient ways to develop Canada’s 
oil sands. For more information, see our Oil Sands 
Brochure and the  2011 Corporate Citizenship Report.

Change Risks

The  multifaceted  risks  of  climate  change  warrant  action  by 
governments,  companies  and  citizens.  ExxonMobil’s  strategy  to 
manage  climate  change  risks  is  focused  on  reducing  greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions through increased energy efficiency, enhanced 
operations of our facilities and technological innovation. As we work 
to reduce emissions, our challenge is to create solutions that protect 
the environment without undermining global economic growth.

In  accordance  with  the  Global  Gas  Flaring 
Reduction Initiative, of which ExxonMobil is a 
charter member, and as specified in our Upstream 
Flaring and Venting Reduction Environmental 
Standard for Projects, our aim is to avoid routine 
flaring and venting of produced fluids in new 
projects. We also design new projects to avoid 
venting reservoir carbon dioxide (CO2) that is 
produced, where practical.

Mitigating GHG Emissions in 
our Operations
At  ExxonMobil,  our  strategy  to  reduce  GHG 
emissions focuses on increasing our own energy 
efficiency in the short term, implementing current 
proven emissions-reducing technologies in the 
medium  term,  and  developing  breakthrough, 
game-changing technologies in the long term. We 
focus on flare reduction, cogeneration of power 
and steam, and improving energy efficiency as 
the key levers. In 2012, we invested $330 million 
to improve energy efficiency, reduce flaring and 
decrease GHG emissions.

available  markets,  nearby  infrastructure  and 
appropriate regulations. Many of these conditions 
are not currently available in some locations where 
we operate. Therefore, reducing the amount of 
flared gas is an ongoing challenge for ExxonMobil’s 
operations in these areas.

Venting is the release of methane emissions without 
flaring. Venting volumes are typically small in our 
industry and are often associated with protocols to 
ensure the safety of an operation and our personnel. 

GHG emissions
In 2012, ExxonMobil’s net equity GHG emissions¹ 
were 125 million metric tons. Relative to our 2011 
performance, this represents a decrease of about 
4 million metric tons, or 3 percent.

In 2012, our Upstream and Downstream flaring 
averaged 361 million cubic feet per day, a decrease 
of  14  percent  from  2011  and  a  reduction  of  
60 percent from 2006. Our operations in Nigeria 
and Equatorial Guinea account for most of our 
flared gas, contributing about 60 percent of our  
total Upstream flaring.

Energy efficiency
In 2012, energy used in our operations totaled 
1.5 billion gigajoules, which remains unchanged 
relative to our 2011 energy usage. ExxonMobil 
pursues a variety of projects to improve energy 
efficiency. Since 2000, we have used our Global 
Energy  Management  System  (GEMS)  in  the 
Downstream  and  Chemical  business  lines  to 
identify and act on energy-savings opportunities. 
The GEMS equivalent in the Upstream business is 
the Production Operations Energy Management 
System (POEMS). 

From 2002 to 2012, we improved energy efficiency 
by  approximately  10  percent  in  refining  and

Heat recovery steam generator
Heat recovery steam generator

our polymer manufacturing facility in Cologne, 
Germany,  a  local  team  inspected  the  plant’s 
steam  system  to  identify  areas  for  potential 
savings. System improvements reduced steam 
consumption by 90 tons per month, a 20 percent 
reduction. At many of our sites, recovering waste 
heat to generate needed steam provides heat 
to processes that would otherwise require the 
combustion  of  additional  fuel.  ExxonMobil’s 
Global Real Estate and Facilities Group has been 
working on an initiative to reduce the environmental 
footprint of our offices. In 2012, we continued 
construction of our new 155-hectare campus just 
north of Houston, Texas. We carefully considered 
energy conservation during the design phase of 
the campus. By optimizing daylight availability and 
incorporating other energy efficiency measures, we 

expect to reduce our energy demand in the office 
buildings by more than 40 percent compared with 
traditional office buildings. ExxonMobil will install 
systems to monitor energy consumption to ensure 
campus buildings achieve a U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency Energy Star rating. 

In  Calgary,  Alberta,  we  are  working  with  the 
developer  of  the  new  Imperial  Oil  campus  to 
incorporate sustainable design practices into the 
construction process, buildings and associated 
green spaces. The use of high-efficiency heating and 
cooling systems, and lighting and motion sensors 
will make the campus 40 to 50 percent more efficient 
than our existing office buildings. In addition, we plan 
to launch energy conservation, waste minimization 
and recycling programs when this campus becomes 

operational. The new Aviation Lubricants Blending 
& Packaging Plant in Port Allen, Louisiana, will 
also have a sustainability focus that extends to 
the design, construction and operational phases. 

Cogeneration
ExxonMobil is developing innovative ways to 
generate power more efficiently and with less 
environmental impact compared with purchasing 
electricity  from  a  local  utility.  Cogeneration 
captures heat generated from the production 
of electricity for use in production, refining and 
chemical processing operations. ExxonMobil has 
interests in approximately 5,200 megawatts of 
cogeneration capacity in more than 100 individual 
installations  at more than 30 locations around the 
world. This capacity is equivalent to the electricity 

needs of approximately 2.5 million U.S. homes. 
In 2012, we added 220 megawatts of additional 
capacity from our new cogeneration facility in 
Singapore. We have additional  projects approved, 
which will add more than 300 megawatts by 2015, 
and several other projects are in various stages 
of development. Since 2004, we have invested 
more than $1 billion in cogeneration projects.

Cutting-Edge Technology
ExxonMobil  invests  in  new  technologies  with 
transformative  potential  to  increase  energy 
supplies,  reduce  emissions  and  improve 
operational efficiency. Our research efforts involve 
proprietary in-house research and collaborations 
with  other  businesses,  as  well  as  research 
partnerships with universities — such as the Global

Managing Climate Change Risks

Climate and Energy Project at Stanford University. 
This pioneering research program focuses on 
identifying  breakthrough  energy  technologies 
ranging from solar fuels to CO2 storage.

At our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical 
research facilities, we have spent nearly $9 billion 
on  research  and  development  over  the  past 
decade, including on technologies specifically 
related  to  reducing  emissions.  Our  research 
portfolio  includes  a  wide  range  of  promising 
technologies,  such  as  carbon  capture  and 
storage, biomass conversion and algae-based 
biofuels. We continuously monitor the competitive 
environment for game-changing opportunities.

Carbon capture and storage
After years of research, evaluation and practice, we 
have concluded that carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) is a technically feasible way to reduce the 
amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. 
CCS involves capturing, transporting and storing 
CO2 in underground geologic formations such as 
saline reservoirs, depleted oil or gas reservoirs, or 
deep coal beds. In the future, CCS technologies

can  offer  other  approaches  to  help  reduce 
CO2 emissions, with the greatest opportunity 
in the coal- and gas-fired power sector. CCS 
economics can be improved when the CO2 is 
applied to enhanced oil and gas recovery in some 
amenable locations. However, CCS application 
will likely be limited until improved technologies 
are developed and countries adopt effective legal 
and regulatory frameworks to manage its use and 
potential impacts over time. Through our natural 
gas operations in Wyoming and our equity interest 
in  the  Sleipner  field  in  Norway,  among  other 
projects, we captured approximately 4.5 million 
metric tons of CO2 for underground injection in 
2012, bringing the total to more than 21 million 
metric tons since 1996. We also have a 25-percent 
interest in a CCS plant in Australia, associated 
with the Gorgon development project that will be 
the largest saline reservoir CO2 injection facility 
in the world, once operational.

4.5 million

metric tons of CO2 
captured for underground 
injection in 2012

For the past year, ExxonMobil’s Controlled Freeze 
Zone™ (CFZ™) commercial demonstration unit in 
Wyoming has been separating CO2 from natural 
gas in a stream that could be efficiently re-injected 
for geo-sequestration or enhanced oil recovery. 
Cost advantages provided by the proprietary 
CFZ™ technology could expand the global supply 
of natural gas and contribute to the reduction of 
GHG emissions.

Algae 
ExxonMobil’s  algae  biofuels  program  was 
announced in 2009. In the early stages of this 
research  effort,  we  remain  focused  on 
understanding the fundamental science of algae 

growth and harvesting necessary to produce 
algae-based  biofuels.  However,  there  are 
significant technological hurdles to developing 
economically competitive fuel from algae. We 
expect  that  commercialization,  if  eventually 
successful, would take a decade or more.

Improving product performance
ExxonMobil develops products that reduce energy 
use and emissions throughout our customers’ 
activities  and  supply  chains,  including  Mobil 
Delvac  1™  LE  5W-30  —  a 
fully  synthetic,  heavy-duty 
diesel engine oil that combines 
advanced engine protection 
with enhanced fuel economy 
potential; Mobil 1™ Advanced 
Fuel Economy — a high-performance synthetic 
engine oil that can help improve fuel economy by 
up to 2 percent; and Mobil DTE 10 Excel™ — a 
series of hydraulic oils that increases equipment 
output, resulting in potential for reduced energy 
consumption and operating costs. For information 
on how we are improving energy efficiency with 
our chemical products, see page 34.

Public Policy Debate
Public policy will play a key role in reducing GHG 
emissions in the future. The long-term objective of 
a climate change policy should be to reduce the 
risks posed by climate change while considering 
the importance of energy to global economic 
development.  Any  policy  response  aimed  at 
mitigating  global  CO2  emissions  will  require 
participation from both developed countries and 
the major developing economies.

Policymakers have available a range of strategies 
to reduce GHG emissions, including cap-and-
trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency 
standards  and  incentives  or  mandates  for 
renewable energy. Where regulated emissions 
trading schemes exist, ExxonMobil has traded 
allowances, when cost-effective, and will continue 

to do so in the future. For example, we have been 
active participants in the European Union Emissions 
Trading Scheme, New Zealand Emissions Trading 
Scheme  and  recent  California  cap-and-trade 
programs. However, we believe a well-designed, 
revenue-neutral carbon tax mechanism provides a 
more cost-effective alternative to a cap-and-trade 
regime for reducing GHG emissions.

International  agreements  and  other  regional 
and  national  regulations  for  GHG  emissions 
reduction  are  still  evolving,  making  it  difficult 
to predict potential business impacts. We test 
a range of potential cost scenarios for energy-
related GHG emissions in our Outlook for Energy. 
These forecasts use a cost of CO2 emissions to 
represent future climate policy options. Over time, 
ExxonMobil anticipates OECD3 member states’ 
CO2 costs to rise to about $80 per ton by 2040, 
with many non-OECD nations approaching $20 per 
ton. We use these forecasts as part of our financial 
analysis for major investment evaluations.

Global engagement on climate change 
ExxonMobil scientists have undertaken climate 
change research and related policy analysis for 
nearly 30 years. Their work has resulted in the 
publication of more than 45 papers in peer-reviewed 
literature. In addition, two of our scientists are among 
only a few from our industry who have participated 
as authors in assessments of the United Nations 
Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change 
since its inception. We will continue to participate  
actively and constructively in advancing the state 
of climate science.

      Stakeholder Engagement: 
        Partnering for GHG Reductions

In a unique partnership, and after nearly 1 million man-hours of construction 
work, ExxonMobil and Air Products inaugurated a new world-scale hydrogen 
production plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. From the early planning 
phase through detailed engineering and startup of the facilities, ExxonMobil 
and  Air  Products  worked  closely  together  to  maximize  synergies  and 
environmental benefits. The new plant connects to the extensive Rotterdam 
hydrogen  pipeline  network,  which  supplies  hydrogen  to  several  other 
customers in the region.

The Air Products plant uses ExxonMobil’s excess refinery gas to produce 
hydrogen, and the refinery uses the hydrogen to manufacture petrochemicals 
and in refinery processes. The new hydrogen plant uses the most advanced 
processes  and  technologies,  making  it  much  more  efficient  than  its 
predecessor. The hydrogen plant also delivers steam out of surplus heat 
to the refinery, replacing steam produced in traditional boilers. The synergy 
in  the  production  processes  of  the  two  plants  improves  overall  energy 
efficiency  by  more  than  15  percent  and  reduces  related  CO²  emissions 
by 200,000 metric tons per year, comparable to taking 90,000 cars off the 
road annually.

“We  need  plants  like  this  one 
nationally as well as internationally to 
achieve our European mid-term and 
long-term environmental ambitions. 
Air Products and ExxonMobil show 
that  by  a  targeted  investment  and 
integration  of  industrial  processes, 
a substantial energy saving and CO2 
reduction are being achieved.”

ExxonMobil  Chemical’s  product  packaging  solutions  work  to 
extend the shelf life of food products and provide lighter-weight 
packaging  options.  These  innovations  help  reduce  food  waste 
and reduce transportation-related energy use.   

Around  the  world,  approximately  870  million 
people — one in eight — suffer from hunger and 
malnutrition, according to the United Nations Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO). At the same 
time, a 2011 FAO-commissioned study reports 
that roughly one-third of the food produced for 
human consumption every year — approximately 
1.3 billion tons — is lost or wasted. Improving the 
food supply chain to reduce food loss and waste is 
critical to ensuring that more people have enough 
food to live healthy and productive lives.

increased food availability. From bread bags to 
milk containers, packaging made from ExxonMobil 
Chemical’s high-performance products, such as 
Exceed™ and Enable™ metallocene polyethylene, 
can help extend freshness, deter spoilage and 
reduce food waste.

Plastic film can extend a 
cucumber’s shelf life to 
14 days.

While this issue is large and involves multiple 
factors, one lever is as simple as the way we 
package food. ExxonMobil Chemical’s products 
are helping to provide packaging solutions that 
address the challenges that exist in the food 
supply chain. The end goal is less waste and 

Increased Shelf Life
Food often spoils due to improper or suboptimal 
storage.  According  to  a  2013  Institution  of 
Mechanical Engineers study, vast quantities of 
foodstuffs, estimated at between 30 percent 
and 50 percent of total global production, are 

lost or wasted between the field and consumer. 
Packaging has an important role to play in the 
reduction of these numbers. Plastic packaging 
solutions  that  ExxonMobil  Chemical  has 
developed  can  help  preserve  freshness  and 
protect products, from farms to grocery shelves 
to  kitchen  tables.  A  cucumber,  for  example, 
which is 96 percent water, begins to dehydrate 
as soon as it is picked. After three days, it has 
lost so much water that it becomes dull, limp and 
unsellable. Wrapping it in just 1.5 grams of plastic 
film, however, can extend its shelf life to 14 days.¹

Lightweight Plastic Packaging
ExxonMobil Chemical’s  products may also enable 
lighter-weight packaging solutions. According to 
the American Chemistry Council (ACC), reduced 
packaging weight has the potential to benefit the 
entire value chain by reducing shipping costs, 
energy  consumption,  emissions  and  waste. 
The ACC notes that plastic jars can use up to  
90 percent less material by weight than their glass 
counterparts, and lightweight, flexible packaging 
made from plastic or plastic-and-foil composites 

can  use  up  to  80  percent  less  material  than 
traditional bag-in-box packages. According to 
another ACC study of plastics used in packaging, 
a  lightweight  plastic  tuna  pouch  can  reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 77 percent during 
transportation compared with a steel can.

Compared  with  other  types  of  polyethylene, 
ExxonMobil’s metallocene-based polyethylene 
products  have  enabled  customers  to  make 
thinner films, while also improving the ease of film 
processing. Our advanced metallocene polyolefin 
resins, including Exceed™ and Enable™, can help 
consumer product companies reduce the amount 
of film used in packaging. For instance, the amount 
of film used in packaging applications such as 
bottled water and soda; bread and produce bags; 
frozen food bags; and prepared fish, meats and 
cheeses can be reduced by up to 30 percent 
over  non-metallocene  polyethylene  grades. 
At the same time, these advanced polyolefins 
maintain or improve the properties of the finished 
film while enhancing overall packaging strength  
and durability.

tHe Workplace 

ExxonMobil’s commitment to excellence in protecting the safety, 
security  and  health  of  our  employees,  our  contractors  and  the 
communities where we work is a core value — one that shapes 
decision-making at every level.

Safety, Security  
and Health Management 
Excellence in safety, security and health in the 
workplace is a core value for our company. Our 
Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) 
puts our safety commitment into action. Every 
ExxonMobil employee and contractor accepts 
safety, security and health as job requirements, 
whether working at a desk, on an oil platform, in 
a refinery or at any of our facilities.

Personnel safety 
In 2012, we moved closer to our goal of Nobody 
Gets Hurt. We have reduced our workforce lost-
time incident rate by an average of 4 percent per 
year since 2002 and by 42 percent from 2011 
to  2012.  XTO  safety  performance  improved 
significantly from 2011 to 2012. The XTO team 
will continue OIMS implementation in 2013 with 
a significant focus on safety leadership. 

It is with deep regret that we report that five 
workers  were  fatally  injured  in  four  separate 
incidents in 2012 in connection with ExxonMobil 
operations.  We  thoroughly  investigated  each 
incident, determined root causes and identified 
steps to prevent similar events in the future. Together 
with other industry leaders, ExxonMobil is working 
to improve our understanding of ways to more 
effectively prevent fatalities or life-altering injuries.

Through  more  robust  planning  for  potential 
consequences, especially those associated with 

higher-risk activities, we will better protect our 
workforce from unacceptable risks. Our analysis 
of safety incidents in the past several years has  
led us to embrace the importance of recognizing 
and reacting to the potential and actual outcomes 
of  an  incident.  Through  careful  analysis,  we  
learned  that  a  subset  of  incidents,  usually 
associated  with  higher-risk  activities,  has  the 
potential to become serious injuries or fatalities. 
This awareness enables teams to better focus 
efforts on those activities. 

The journey to safety excellence requires us to 
seek opportunities to continuously improve our 
approaches  to  the  prevention  of  injuries  and 
illnesses. In this regard, our analysis indicates that 
human factors continue to be primary contributors 
to incidents. We have learned that this, in part, has 
to do with the personal choices each of us makes 
to either accept or reject risk. At ExxonMobil,  we 
refer to this notion as “risk tolerance.” 

The concept of risk tolerance involves recognizing 
and identifying the risk, understanding it and then 
making the choice to either accept or reduce 
the risk. This has created an important dialogue 
that  helps  elevate  awareness  and  reinforces 
expectations across all levels of our workforce. 

We  also  continued  to  orient  global  safety 
awareness efforts around “Actively Caring and 
Approaching Others” — an integral characteristic 
of an established and effective safety culture 

where workers take ownership and accountability 
for their own and each other’s personal safety.

During  2012,  we  began  developing  content 
for a new training experience called the OIMS 
Leadership Academy. The training is aimed at 
enhancing the OIMS leadership skills of middle-
level line managers. We plan to pilot this training 
in mid-2013. 

We are rolling out a new leadership development 
program focused on enhancing the ability of our 
leaders to more effectively communicate about 
safety performance, incidents, challenges and 
successes.  This  program  will  help  positively 
impact  behavior  and  performance  and  make 
safety more personal.

In October 2012, the National Safety Council (NSC) 
announced that ExxonMobil had been awarded 
the 2013 Green Cross for Safety® medal for our 
comprehensive commitment to safety excellence. 
Presented annually, NSC awards the Green Cross 
for Safety® medal to organizations with outstanding 
performance and achievements in workplace 
safety,  community  service,  environmental 
stewardship and responsible citizenship. 

Driver safety 
Nearly 1.3 million people die every year from 
vehicle-related incidents, and up to 50 million are 
injured. In an effort to improve safety on the road, 
the United Nations has marked 2011 to 2020 as the 
Decade of Action for Road Safety. ExxonMobil is 
contributing to that effort. In 2012, we enhanced 
our defensive driving training program with a 
course that teaches drivers to detect and avoid 
other drivers on the road who may be distracted. 
We  partnered  with  the  Smith  System  Driver 
Improvement Institute to develop the custom 
training,  which  is  available  to  all  ExxonMobil

To  continue  improving  safety  performance, 
ExxonMobil  Production  Company  (EMPC) 
reviewed the significant injuries experienced in 
the past decade. Results showed that although 
injury rates were decreasing, employees and 
contractors experienced some serious injuries 
while undertaking higher-risk activities. This 
study led to the development of Nine Life-Saving 
Actions  that,  when  effectively  implemented, 
are the practices most important in preventing 
serious injuries. EMPC developed a series of 
awareness and education tools to ensure that 
every employee and contractor understands 
the life-saving actions and applies them at all 
EMPC work sites.

efforts between our employees and contractors 
regarding safety. At our Baytown, Texas, complex, 
we identified barriers to safe practices among our 
contractors. To address this issue, we developed 
a set of site safety standards for all contract 
companies at Baytown that outlined critical roles 
and expectations of managers to improve safety 
accountability. The standards encourage a greater 
focus on hazard management and recognition, 
job hazard analysis and root cause analysis for 
incidents. By actively engaging contractors and 
their managers in this effort, Baytown’s contractor 
total  recordable  incident  rate  has  decreased 
significantly in recent years.  

Process safety
Process safety management calls for managing 
the integrity of operating systems by applying 
good design principles and engineering, as well 
as sound operating and maintenance practices. 
Effective process safety management prevents 
the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons and 
other  hazardous  substances  with  the  aim  of 
avoiding significant incidents with the potential 

for serious injuries and fatalities, widespread 
environmental impact and property damage. 

Our approach focuses on reducing risks and 
incidents through the flawless execution of OIMS. 
This includes cataloging risks and scenarios and 
employing a risk matrix to help focus overall risk-
reduction efforts. Then we identify mitigation 
measures and design multiple safety barriers. 

We  subscribe  to  industry  standards  —  the 
American Petroleum Institute Recommended 
Practice 754 and International Association of 
Oil  &  Gas  Producers  No.  456  —  that  define 
process safety indicators and use a process 
safety incident triangle to represent events from 
tier 1 through tier 4. Process safety events fall into 
two categories: tier 1 and tier 2. Tier 3 represents 
process safety “near-misses,” and tier 4 represents 
leading performance measures, such as on-time 
maintenance performance. The lower tiers are 
measured and tracked to prevent events in tiers 1 
and 2. During 2012, we had 63 tier-1 process safety 
events. Incident analysis indicates that human 
factors, procedures, training and supervision were 
the primary contributing elements for these events. 

We investigate incidents and near-misses, capture 
incidents in a common database and share them 
with engineering networks. We also collaborate with 
the American Petroleum Institute, the American 
Fuels and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the 
American  Chemistry  Council  to  share  lessons 
learned associated with process safety events. 
We report process safety performance metrics at 
a prescribed frequency to our company presidents, 
management committee and chief executive officer.

Emergency Preparedness
Effective  emergency  preparedness  depends 
on competent response teams. To develop and 
practice  emergency  response  strategies,  we 
establish emergency support groups comprising 
representatives  from  business  lines;  human

resources;  law;  safety,  security,  health  and 
environment; public and government affairs; and 
other technical advisors. We routinely test these 
trained teams on a range of possible scenarios, 
including  simulated  spills,  fires,  explosions, 
natural disasters and security incidents. Every 
site conducts emergency drills in accordance with 
regulatory requirements and OIMS Guidelines. 

We operate in some countries that do not have 
clear  emergency  response  requirements.  In 
those cases, we apply global good practices 
to determine the frequency of emergency drills.

In 2012, we conducted comprehensive drills in 
Australia, Canada, Singapore, Romania, Russia 
and the United States. Each drill resulted in a list 
of good practices and potential improvement 
areas. ExxonMobil Production Company (EMPC) 
conducted a comprehensive drill during 2012 
simulating  a  subsea  release  at  one  of  our 
deepwater platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. More 
than 300 employees, contractors and specialists, 
the  Marine  Well  Containment  Company  and 
several representatives from the U.S. Coast Guard 
and  the  Bureau  of  Safety  and  Environmental 
Enforcement participated. The three-day drill 
included the time frame from initial response to 
simulating the lowering of a capping stack that 

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report  
Safety, Health and the Workplace 

would seal off a leaking well. Lessons learned 
included the need to better understand how to 
estimate flow rates from such an event and ways 
to improve coordination between response teams.

Employee Health
ExxonMobil  provides  support  programs  and 
services to help our employees live healthier lives. 
We consider workforce and community health 
issues to be key aspects of our project planning. 

Infectious disease management 
Exposure to infectious diseases — especially 
those found in tropical climates — can affect 
our workforce, their families and surrounding 
communities. We have established a steering 
committee  for  infectious  disease  control  to 
monitor and address emerging disease-related 
issues  built  on  the  successful  organizational 
structure  of  our  Malaria  Control  Program. 
The committee plans to focus on developing 
and implementing programs in countries with 
a significant threat of vector-borne diseases, 
such as malaria, dengue fever and Japanese 
encephalitis; infectious disease outbreaks due 
to norovirus, pandemic influenza, cholera and 
other pathogens; tuberculosis; and HIV/AIDS.  
The  committee  is  working  to  design  and 
disseminate plans and awareness tools and review 
disease control programs of various affiliates.

Our workplace HIV/AIDS program, StopAIDS, 
combines educational programs with access to 
community-based care and treatment to keep 
healthy workers disease-free and to educate 
HIV-positive workers on living with the illness. 
ExxonMobil  does  not  test  for  HIV,  and  HIV  
status is not a factor in determining an employee’s 
ability to work. 

In 2012, our Angolan affiliate, Esso Angola, held 
an HIV/AIDS counseling and testing campaign that 
StopAIDS spearheaded. In partnership with the 
Ministry of Health’s National Institute in the Fight

        up Close: Emergency response training

It is ExxonMobil’s objective to respond rapidly and effectively to any type of incident that could 
occur, from a spill to a hurricane. Our specialized three-day training program equips employees 
with the skills needed to plan for and carry out a response using an Incident Command System 
structure, a process utilized by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Coast 
Guard and other organizations. 

Classroom instruction includes presentations on such topics as hazard recognition, spill containment 
and recovery, protective equipment, decontamination procedures, environmental sensitivities, oil 
spill behavior and effects, risk management, media relations, government affairs and the use of 
dispersants. We follow two days of classroom sessions with a day of outdoor hands-on training 
using oil spill response equipment. 

Training sessions began in 2009, and more than 400 employees have participated. In 2012, we 
expanded this program internationally. Upon completing the course, students have the basic 
training required to serve as incident commanders.

An  ExxonMobil  spill  training  class  in  Paradis, 

Louisiana.  The  training  is  designed  to  provide 

employees with the skills they need to respond to 

an incident quickly and efficiently. 

Against AIDS and the Committee for Businesses 
in  Fighting  HIV/AIDS,  Esso  Angola  held  a 
two-day campaign to provide optional testing 
and counseling to more than 300 employees. 

We track employee and contractor incidences of 
malaria in eight countries. In 2012, 10 malaria cases 
were reported, compared with 10 in 2011, out of the 
thousands of non-immune workers located in or 
visiting endemic areas. Thus far, we estimate our 
workplace Malaria Control Program has averted  
16 deaths and 1,739 cases of malaria among 
non-immune workers. 

Preventative health
Multiple studies point to the fact that investing 
in  preventative  health  care  is  an  effective 
way  of  reducing  the  incidence  of  chronic 
conditions,  such  as  heart  disease,  diabetes, 
respiratory  ailments,  cancer  and  depression. 
ExxonMobil’s  Culture  of  Health  is  our  U.S. 
site-based  preventative  health  and  wellness 
program.  ExxonMobil  gradually  introduced 
health  awareness  campaigns  and  seminars 
to employees at work sites across the United 
States in 2012 on topics ranging from workplace 
ergonomics to eating habits to fitness.

We have rolled out a new technology for field-
testing  company  workplaces  in  West  Africa 
and  Papua  New  Guinea.  The  tests  are  used 
to  ensure  non-immune  workers  are  taking 
chemoprophylaxis,  which  is  prescription 
medication used to prevent malaria. The new 
technology obtains test results within 10 minutes, 
rather than four weeks, and costs 90 percent less. 
To learn about our efforts to eradicate malaria in 
the communities where we operate, see page 64.

Another example of a local wellness program 
can be found at our Singapore petrochemical 
expansion project. Since construction began 
in 2007, nearly 87,000 construction personnel 
from 40 countries have performed work at the 
site.  Because  of  the  site’s  remote  location, 
the project team developed a fitness-to-work 
program  that  includes  a  full-service  medical 
team on-site, a checklist to screen workers for 
illness or injury, training on illness   recognition,  

routine   health  and  hygiene  inspections  and 
return-to-work medical exams. This commitment 
to  comprehensive  health  care  is  critical  to  
managing the health and safety aspects of such 
a large workforce.

We  apply  a  similar  approach  at  our  Chad/
Cameroon  pipeline  project.  Health  care  is  a  
valued employee benefit in Chad and Cameroon 
because it can be difficult to access, especially 
in rural areas. In 2012, project health care clinics 
provided more than 19,000 free consultations  
to ExxonMobil workers. 

Workplace Security 
ExxonMobil continually assesses our vulnerability 
to security breaches — both to our physical assets 
and to our intellectual property. In 2005, we formally 
integrated security into OIMS, allowing us to embed 
it more deeply into day-to-day operations. Since 
then,  ExxonMobil  has  developed  consistent 
worldwide security practices and appointed and 
trained site-security contacts to meet challenges 
in the diverse locations where we operate. 

2012 Corporate Citizenship ReportSafety, Health and the Workplace 

Each new facility goes through a security analysis that 
takes into account perceived risks, the application 
of potential countermeasures, relationships with 
communities, compliance with applicable laws and 
recognition of social norms. Our security managers 
regularly participate in governmental and industry 
forums to further enhance our established risk-
management methodologies, threat-assessment 
capabilities and technical security applications. In 
higher-threat locations, we monitor local conditions 
and maintain detailed security preparedness plans. 

As information technology continues to evolve, 
cyber attacks present a risk to the safety and 
security of ExxonMobil’s data, facilities and ongoing 
business operations. During 2012, employees and 
contractors received cyber security training to 
learn to recognize and protect ExxonMobil against 
such threats. For more information about security 
at ExxonMobil, see page 61.

Product Stewardship  
and Safety
ExxonMobil  works  to  minimize  the  risks  and 
impacts associated with the manufacture, use 
and disposal of our products. 

Compliance and product safety disclosure
As part of product stewardship, we assess safety, 
health and environmental aspects, as well as 
compliance with product safety legislation, both 
where our products are made and in their intended 
markets. OIMS and other management systems 
help ensure compliance with product stewardship 
regulations  in  more  than  150  countries.  Our 
Product Stewardship Information Management 
System applies common global processes and 
computer systems to capture and communicate 
information  on  the  safe  handling,  transport, 
use and disposal of our products, as well as 
emergency contact information. 

growing number of new regulatory requirements 
that  may  apply  to  our  products.  For  example,  
the  United  Nations  Globally  Harmonized 
System  of  Classification  and  Labelling  of 
Chemicals  (GHS)  for  hazard  communication 
is  being  progressively  introduced  around 
the  world.  By  the  end  of  2012,  approximately  
20  countries  in  which  ExxonMobil  has  an 
interest  had  introduced  local  adaptations  of 
GHS. The pace of implementation is expected 
to  accelerate  over  the  next  few  years  as  
additional countries, including the United States, 
adopt GHS. 

In Europe, the chemical regulatory framework, 
Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorization  and 
Restriction  of  Chemicals  (REACH),  requires 
manufacturers  and  importers  to  provide 
extensive information about the environmental 
and  health  impacts  of  their  products  through 
a dedicated registration process. ExxonMobil 
has  developed  and  implemented  rigorous 
programs  at  our  European  manufacturing 
plants,  and  along  the  entire  supply  chain, 
to  meet  REACH  requirements.  To  date,  we 
have  successfully  completed  more  than 
200  substance  registrations,  approximately  
50 percent of the total required for completion 
by 2018.

As members of the American Chemistry Council 
(ACC), we promote product stewardship in our 
Chemical business by implementing the United 
Nations  Global  Product  Strategy  Program, 
a  voluntary  program  that  provides  public 
information on the safe use of chemicals. ACC 
members, including ExxonMobil, have posted 
more than 3,000 product safety summaries online 
and have completed this effort for all high-priority 
chemicals in 2012.

A  comprehensive  regulatory  surveillance 
process  is  in  place  to  monitor  and  evaluate  a

Up Close: Combatting Tuberculosis in  
Papua New Guinea

Wherever  we  operate,  we  uphold  our  commitment  to  building  sustainable  health  capacity 
and infrastructure. At our Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project, we partnered with  
the Papua New Guinean government and key non-governmental organizations to provide new 
medical equipment to combat tuberculosis. This disease represents a health challenge in most 
developing countries.

To  date,  the  Papua  New  Guinea  liquefied  natural  gas  project  has  contributed  nearly  
$1.25 million to support tuberculosis control. This includes assisting the Papua New Guinea 
Institute  of  Medical  Research  in  securing  three  state-of-the  art  tuberculosis  diagnostic  
machines for health facilities in the community. Traditionally, patients had to wait six to eight 
weeks for test results. These new machines provide a same-day response with high accuracy, 
allowing for early intervention and immediate treatment. 

that  offers  consumers  information  on  where 
they  can  properly  dispose  of  used  motor  oil 
at  specific  product-collection  locations.  We 
recently signed another three-year contract with 
Earth911.com to extend this important service 
to our customers. 

Life-cycle assessments
ExxonMobil employs life-cycle thinking to help 
manage the full range of potential safety, health 
and environmental impacts associated with our 
operations  and  products.  The  United  Nations 
Environment Programme’s Life Cycle Initiative 
is a partnership between the United Nations and 
the Society for Environmental Toxicology and 
Chemistry that is intended to put life-cycle thinking 
into practice globally. As an active participant, we 
contribute to studies and training initiatives related 
to life-cycle assessment (LCA), including for oil 

sands and tight gas. Our Chemical business follows 
the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006) in developing 
LCAs. During 2012, we began an LCA of Marcellus 
Shale gas used for power generation. We based 
this analysis on extensive data from actual gas 
production and power generation operations. We 
submitted the results for publication in a peer-
reviewed journal. 

Employment Policies 
and Practices
ExxonMobil focuses on developing a diverse 
workforce of highly talented individuals to achieve 
our business objectives. We use a long-term, 
career-oriented approach that begins with global 
recruitment of outstanding talent and continues 
with development from within through a wide 
range of assignments and experiences.

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report 
Safety, Health and the Workplace 

the  National  Action  Council  for  Minorities  in 
Engineering, among others. We believe these 
strategic investments in education will help build 
a global pool of talent in science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics fields to support  
the  further  development  of  the  oil  and  gas 
industry. Without education today, we cannot 
advance technological innovation to help meet 
our future energy needs. For more information on 
our educational initiatives, see page 64.

Regarding our geographic workforce footprint, at 
the end of 2012, approximately 41 percent of our 
employees were located within the United States 
and 59 percent were located internationally. In 
2012, approximately 33 percent of our executives 
were non-U.S. employees. We hired more than 
2,500 management and professional employees 
worldwide,  about  68  percent  of  whom  were 
outside  the  United  States.  In  addition,  we 
sponsored more than 1,200 global internships 
and cooperative assignments.

ExxonMobil is committed to promoting leadership 
opportunities for women globally and improving 
the gender balance within our company. This 
commitment  extends  to  all  aspects  of  the 
employment relationship, including recruitment, 
hiring, training, promotion, transfer and wage and 
salary administration. Currently, women account 
for about 28 percent of our worldwide workforce, 
excluding company-operated retail stores. In 
2012, 39 percent of management and professional 
new hires were women, significantly higher than 
the percentage of women in our broader employee 
population. Approximately 15 percent of executive 
employees worldwide are women, an increase of 
50 percent over the past decade. 

To increase the representation of minorities in 
our U.S. operations, our hiring programs include 
outreach  to  identify  diverse  candidates.  This 
emphasis  includes  our  technical  scholarship 
program,  which  awards  scholarships  to

of our U.S. executives in 2012 were minorities,  
representing  a  33  percent  increase  over  the  
past decade.

Policies against discrimination 
and harassment
ExxonMobil’s programs and policies are designed 
to  employ  the  best  people,  recognize  and 
reward superior job performance and create an 
environment in which employees can maximize 
their contributions and reach their full potential. 
A discrimination-free environment is essential  
to meeting these objectives.

Our  Standards  of  Business  Conduct  govern 
all  aspects  of  the  employment  relationship, 
including recruitment, hiring, work assignment, 
promotion, transfer, termination, wage and salary 
administration and selection for training. These 
Standards  support  our  commitment  to  equal 
employment opportunities, prohibit harassment 
and discrimination in the workplace and align with 
applicable laws and regulations in the countries 
where we operate. Any form of discrimination 
by or toward employees, contractors, suppliers 
and customers in any ExxonMobil workplace is 
strictly prohibited. 

Our global zero-tolerance policy applies to all 
forms of discrimination, including discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Harassment,  even  in  its  most  subtle  forms, 
directly conflicts with company policy and will 
not be tolerated. All employees are subject to 
disciplinary action, including termination, for any 
act of harassment. We employ a comprehensive 
education, training and stewardship program to 
ensure that employees worldwide understand, 
implement and follow our anti-harassment policy. 

We  also  provide  training  programs  for  new 
employees  and  refresher  courses  for  existing 

Diversity
ExxonMobil  conducts  business  in  almost 
every part of the world. The diversity of ideas, 
perspectives,  skills,  knowledge  and  cultures 
across our company facilitates innovation and 
is a key competitive advantage. Through a range 
of programs, activities and investments, we strive 
to  create  and  maintain  a  diverse  workforce 
representative  of  the  numerous  geographies 
where  we  do  business.  Our  Global  Diversity 
Framework is the foundation for this approach with 
three interrelated objectives: attract, develop and 
retain a premier, diverse workforce; actively foster 
a productive work environment where individual 
and cultural differences are respected and valued; 
and identify and develop leadership capabilities 
to excel in a global environment.  We use a series 
of web-based trainings and tools to support this 
framework and help our employees understand 
effective  cross-cultural  communication  and 
cultural sensitivities.

We support local employee networks around the 
world to foster a work environment committed to 
diversity and inclusion. These include the Asian 
Connection for Excellence (ACE); Black Employee 
Success Team (BEST); Global Organization for 
the  Advancement  of  Latinos  (GOAL);  People  
for Respect, Inclusion and Diversity of Employees 
(PRIDE); and Women’s Interest Network (WIN). 
These groups facilitate professional development 
programs, sponsor educational and community 
service  programs to raise cultural awareness, and 
actively mentor and assimilate new employees 
to ExxonMobil. 

Our comprehensive diversity and inclusion efforts 
also include educational partnerships and supplier 
diversity  initiatives  designed  to  improve  the 
quality of life where we live and work. We support 
diversity-based education programs, such as the 
Hispanic Heritage Foundation, National Society

time employment and adjustable work hours. 

Training and development
One  component  to  retaining  and  maximizing 
the talent of a high-performing workforce for 
the  long  term  is  a  comprehensive  corporate 
and  technical  training  program.  In  2012,  our 
major business units together spent more than  
$88  million  on  training,  reaching  more  than 
76,000 participants. To strengthen our technical 
capacity, more than 70 percent of our investment 
was directed to professional technical training. In 
addition, more than 3,500 employees at various 
management levels participated in ExxonMobil’s 
leadership development training programs in 
2012,  of  which  29  percent  were  women  and  

57  percent  were  non-U.S.  employees.  Our 
Upstream  companies  continued  strategic 
investment  in  capability  development  by  
rolling  out  a  technical  and  commercial  
leadership  training  program  that  enhances 
the  operational  and  business  skills  of  our  
professional workforce.

In addition to formal training, ExxonMobil provides 
a variety of job experiences and development 
tools tailored to individual needs through various 
assignments during an employee’s career. 

Employee engagement
ExxonMobil strives to communicate openly with 
our nearly 77,000 employees. In 2012, presidents 
of  the  functional  companies  held  more  than  
60 town-hall-style forums and interactive meetings 
with employees, addressing topics such as safety, 
business performance and strategic initiatives, as 
well as answering employee questions.

Employee benefits and programs
Exxon Mobil Corporation is committed to being 
the world’s premier petroleum and petrochemical 
company. Our benefits programs are part of a 
total remuneration package designed to support 
our  long-term  business  objectives  as  well  as 
attract,  retain  and  reward  the  most  qualified 
employees. The goal is to be responsive to the 
needs of employees throughout their careers and 
into retirement.

Providing access to affordable health care helps 
employees manage health care issues and reduce 
related financial concerns, assisting them in being 
productive and focused on job responsibilities. 
Strong preventive health care plans and health-
related programs also reinforce the Corporation’s 
commitment to wellness.

Performance review process
ExxonMobil supervisors foster an environment 
where  personal  and  professional  growth  is 
encouraged and where employees understand 
company  expectations  of  high  performance 
and individual development. During the annual 
performance  assessment  and  development 
process,  all  employees  have  a  structured, 
documented discussion with their supervisors 
about work accomplishments, training objectives, 
development opportunities and career interests. 
This  process  provides  the  basis  for  ongoing 
employee coaching and continuous performance 
improvement. Employees are actively improving 
throughout  the  course  of  their  careers  with 
training,  mentoring  and  opportunities  to  join 
professional networks. 

Flexible work environment 
Our  workplace  flexibility  programs  improve 
business  and  operational  results  by  helping 
us attract and retain talent, address individual

workplace  flexibility  programs,  which  may 
be  customized  and  used  individually  or  in 
combination  to  meet  individual  needs.  Each

GovernanCe

At ExxonMobil, our disciplined approach to corporate governance 
is a part of our success. We believe that an unwavering commitment 
to high ethical standards and business integrity is critical to our 
competitive advantage and securing shareholder value.

Board of Directors
Our  board  of  directors  provides  independent 
oversight of the Corporation’s affairs. All directors 
stand  for  election  at  our  annual  meeting  of 
shareholders. At year-end 2012, 11 of 12 directors, 
including the presiding director and all members 
of key board committees, were independent as 
defined by New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) 
guidelines. In 2012, the board of directors met  
10 times, and visited LaBarge, Wyoming, to review 
affiliated operations.

Board leadership structure
The  independent  board  members  select  an 
independent director to serve a minimum of two 
years as presiding director. The presiding director 
chairs executive sessions of the independent 
directors and works closely with the chairman to 
develop board agendas, topics and schedules. 
All  directors  may  request  agenda  topics  for 
board  or  board  committee  meetings,  and  
all have the authority to call special meetings  
of the independent directors.

At this time, the board serves the best interests 
of  the  shareholders  through  a  leadership 
model with a combined chairman of the board 
and  chief  executive  officer  (CEO).  With  more 
than  37  years  of  service  in  both  domestic 
and  international  positions,  our  current 
CEO  possesses  in-depth  knowledge  of  the  
Corporation and the challenges of an evolving 
energy industry. 

Board appointment process
Achieving a board of directors that is diverse in 
gender, race, geography, experiences and fields 
of expertise is critical to successful business in a 
globalized market. The Board Affairs Committee 
nominates director candidates in accordance 
with the Guidelines for the Selection of Non-
Employee Directors. The committee looks for 
highly qualified non-employee candidates with 
demonstrated competency in a particular field 
and a commitment to represent the interests of 
all shareholders. Other desirable qualities include:

•  Financial expertise
•  Experience as the CEO or senior executive of 
a significant company or organization, with 
responsibilities for global operations

•   Experience on one or more boards of significant 
public or non-governmental organizations
•   Expertise  resulting  from  significant  pro-
fessionally or academically based scientific 
or research activities

In  2012,  the  board  included  female,  African-
American and international members. Two new 
directors, Henrietta Fore and Ursula Burns, were 
identified, recruited and appointed for election in 
2012. We describe current director qualifications 
in our proxy statement. 

Board committees
Corporate citizenship topics fall under the purview 
of the Public Issues and Contributions Committee 

Our board of directors provides independent oversight of the Corporation’s affairs. Board members seated from 

left to right: Edward E. Whitacre, Jr., Michael J. Boskin, Jay S. Fishman, Ursula M. Burns, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe 

and Samuel J. Palmisano. Board members standing from left to right: Steven S Reinemund, Henrietta H. Fore, 

Larry R. Faulkner, Rex W. Tillerson, William W. George and Kenneth C. Frazier.

(PICC), the Board Affairs Committee and the 
Compensation  Committee,  and  are  routinely 
reviewed at board committee meetings. Only 
independent directors serve on these committees, 
each of which met between five and eight times 
in 2012.

The  entire  ExxonMobil  board  of  directors 
receives in-depth briefings at least annually that 
cover updates on public policy and scientific 
and  technical  research,  as  well  as  company 
positions and actions in these areas. The board 
is  responsible  for  risk  oversight;  committees 
help the board focus on risk aspects relevant to  
each committee.

For example, the board’s PICC is responsible 
for  the  oversight  of  safety,  health,  social 
responsibility and environmental performance, 
including climate change risk. The PICC reviews 
the effectiveness of the Corporation’s policies, 
programs  and  practices  in  these  areas.  The 
PICC  also  hears  reports  from  operating  units 
on  safety  and  environmental  activities,  and 
visits operating sites to observe and comment 
on current operating practices. Each committee’s 
charter is available on our website.

Executive compensation 
and strategic advantage
At  ExxonMobil,  our  compensation  program 
is  carefully  structured  to  support  long-term 
shareholder value given the capital-intensive 
nature of our business, long investment lead 
times and the critical importance of managing 
risk. The most senior executives — including 
the CEO, Named Executive Officers and more 
than 1,000 other U.S. executives — participate 
in a common compensation program.

Safety  is  a  core  value  for  ExxonMobil.  Com-
pensation  decisions  for  executives  take  into 
account several strategic key criteria, including 
results in the areas of safety, security, health and 
environmental performance. The Operations 
Integrity Management System (OIMS), which 
establishes common expectations for addressing 
inherent  risks  in  our  business,  takes  priority 
over other business and financial objectives. 
Compensation is based on a rigorous annual 
individual performance assessment process, 
and  ExxonMobil  executives  understand  that 
their compensation will reflect how effectively 
they  implement  OIMS.  The  design  of  the 
compensation program, including long holding 

45

exxonmobil.com

2012 Corporate Citizenship ReportCorporate Governance

periods  for  stock-based  awards  and  risk  of 
forfeiture of these awards, ensures that senior 
executives have a strong financial incentive to 
focus on long-term operations integrity as they 
protect the safety and security of our employees, 
the communities and environments in which we 
operate, and the sustainable value of the company 
for shareholders.

and our long-standing philosophy that executive 
compensation  should  be  based  on  long-term 
performance.  A  more  detailed  description  of 
the company’s dialogue with shareholders and 
considerations by the Compensation Committee 
regarding the advisory say-on-pay vote can be 
found on page 62 of the proxy statement issued  
April 12, 2013.

The  Compensation  Committee  carefully 
considered  the  results  of  the  2012  advisory 
vote  on  executive  compensation,  in  which 
more  than  77  percent  of  votes  cast  were 
“for”  the  company’s  compensation  program. 
The  committee  considered  shareholder 
feedback on executive compensation received 
through  a  wide-ranging  dialogue  between  
management  and  numerous  shareholders, 
including the company’s largest shareholders, 
many  of  whom  have  held  ExxonMobil  stock 
for  more  than  a  decade.  All  shareholders 
were invited to a webinar in 2012 to facilitate 
their  understanding  of  the  linkage  between 
our  compensation  program  and  business 
priorities. These outreach initiatives provided an 
excellent opportunity to discuss the relationship 
between pay and business results, including the 
company’s  safety  and  environmental  results 

ExxonMobil is committed to continued engage-
ment  with  shareholders  to  fully  understand 
diverse viewpoints and to discuss the important 
connections between the company’s compensation 
program, business strategy and long-term financial 
and operating performance.

Communicating with directors
ExxonMobil’s  directors  encourage  open  and 
transparent  communication  on  corporate 
citizenship  topics.  Individuals  can  email  our 
non-employee directors through the Corporate 
Governance page of our website or send written 
correspondence in care of the Secretary of the 
Corporation. ExxonMobil employees work closely 
with directors in responding to these letters and 
emails. Directors sometimes request that senior 
managers meet with shareholders to address 
particular topics.

      Up Close: Board Affairs Committee

The Board Affairs Committee (BAC) reviews and provides advisory direction on compliance 
and corporate governance guidelines and identifies individuals qualified to become board 
members. The role allows the BAC to plan for non-employee director successions and review 
candidates nominated by shareholders and other outside sources. 

In 2012, one ExxonMobil board member retired and the BAC identified, recruited and nominated 
two new directors — Henrietta Fore and Ursula Burns. Both women are now active members 
of  the  board.  Current  directors,  working  with  an  executive  search  firm,  identified  these 
candidates. At the BAC’s direction, ExxonMobil personnel conducted extensive research on 
both candidates to verify their credentials. The BAC then nominated these two candidates as 
potential board members, and the full board elected them.

Shareholder Relations
We  engage  in  constructive  dialogue  with  our 
shareholders on a variety of issues throughout the 
year. In 2012, we had 34 shareholder dialogues 
with labor unions, religious organizations, state 
pension funds, socially responsible investors and 

institutional shareholders. At the Corporation’s 2012 
annual meeting, shareholders owning approximately  
3.9  billion  —  or  nearly  83  percent  —  of  the 
outstanding shares were represented. Shareholders 
voted on directors, independent auditors, executive 
compensation and six other shareholder proposals.

ExxonMobil has engaged with shareholders  
on a variety of important topics, including:

•  Board diversity
•  Human rights policy
•  Executive compensation
•  Renewable energy
•  Amendment of Equal Employment 

Opportunity policy
•  Independent chairman
•  Health in Africa
•  Political contributions
•  Climate risk
•  Security in Aceh, Indonesia
•  Equatorial Guinea
•  Biodiversity impact

•  Energy technology
•   Special shareholder meetings
•  Cumulative voting
•  Shareholder advisory vote on

•  Greenhouse gas emissions goals
•  Canadian oil sands
•  Shale gas operations
•  Water
•  Wetlands restoration

2012 Corporate Citizenship ReportCorporate Governance

Every  year,  ExxonMobil  receives  suggestions 
from  shareholders  on  ways  to  improve  the 
company. Management and the board consider 
these suggestions and typically seek a dialogue 
with  the  proposal  sponsor.  The  Corporate 
Citizenship  Report,  Energy  Outlook,  Carbon 
Disclosure Project submission, and ExxonMobil’s 
website content have been helpful in discussions 
with  shareholders.  Our  public  disclosures 
demonstrate  that  we  report  on  matters 
important  to  our  shareholders,  which  helps 
build  understanding  regarding  the  company’s 
progress on certain issues. In the past five years, 
proponents  have  withdrawn  18  proposals  on 
governance,  social  and  environmental  issues 
from  labor,  individuals,  religious  groups  and 
socially responsible investors. 

When an agreement is not reached, the proposal 
and the board’s response and recommendation 
are published in our proxy statement for review 
at  the  annual  meeting  of  shareholders.  For 
example, in 2011 and 2012, ExxonMobil received 
a shareholder proposal requesting the separation 
of the positions of chairman of the board and 
CEO. The board evaluated this proposal and 
believes that the decision as to who should serve 
as chairman and CEO and whether those offices 
should be combined or separated is the proper 
responsibility of the board. Shareholder support 
of this proposal was approximately 35 percent.

Ethics
Performing with the highest ethical standards of 
business conduct is a key competitive strength 
—  critical  to  maintaining  our  global  license  to 
operate. Our presence in nearly every country of 
the world requires training on international trade 
laws, including U.S. anti-corruption and anti-trust 
laws, as well as those in other countries where we do 
business. All employees are expected to uphold the 
highest ethical standards of business integrity. Each 
must comply with all applicable laws and accurately 
record and track all business transactions.

47

exxonmobil.com

Employees are subject to disciplinary action, 
including termination, for violations of our policies. 
Employees receive training on our ethics policy 
every  four  years  through  business  practices 
reviews,  including  a  detailed  review  of  our 
Standards of Business Conduct, implementation 
guidelines and procedures, and the Corporation’s 
anti-trust and anti-corruption policies. These 
general training sessions, in addition to more 
comprehensive training given to relevant functions 
on  a  more  frequent  basis,  are  a  condition  of 
employment at ExxonMobil.

Standards of Business Conduct
Our Standards of Business Conduct define the 
global ethical conduct of the Corporation and its 
majority-owned subsidiaries. These Standards, 
adopted  and  administered  by  the  board  of 
directors,  uphold  the  values  of  human  rights, 
labor,  the  environment  and  anti-corruption. 
While ExxonMobil is not a formal signatory of 
the United Nations Global Compact, its values 
represent key elements of our Standards. No one 
has authority to make exceptions or grant waivers 
to the Standards, and employees are expected to 
review the Standards each year. Disciplinary action 
is taken against any employee who violates them. 

Internal audits
Regular  internal  audits  and  self-assessments 
help ensure the rigorous implementation of our 
control  systems  and  Standards  of  Business 
Conduct.  ExxonMobil’s  internal  team  of  more 
than 200 auditors annually audits approximately 
one-third of ExxonMobil’s operations, conducting 
detailed assessments of facilities, business units, 
personnel and records, and thoroughly investigating 
noncompliance with the standards. These audits are 
conducted across all functions of the Corporation.

Bribery and corruption
Anti-corruption practices are an essential component 
of our compliance program, given that we operate 
globally and in many challenging environments.

The Anti-Corruption Legal Compliance Summary 
outlines ExxonMobil’s commitment to comply with 
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), 
the United Kingdom Bribery Act and global anti-
corruption standards in all business relationships. 
It also describes elements of the Corporation’s 
anti-corruption compliance program.

ExxonMobil  employees  and  contractors  are 
prohibited from making payments to, or engaging 
in  transactions  with,  government  officials  to 
influence the performance of their official duties 
improperly. Maintaining internal controls and 
keeping  accurate  and  complete  transaction 
records are required. Our standard language for 
procurement contracts includes a requirement to 

comply with all laws, keep accurate books and 
records, and where appropriate, contains specific 
anti-bribery commitments.

Training
Oil and gas exploration and production often take us 
to remote parts of the world, with changing political 
and regulatory climates. In 2012, approximately 
31,000 employees took part in anti-corruption 
training. This training covers the basics of the 
FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, global 
anti-corruption standards, recent developments 
in enforcement, and compliance with our internal 
anti-corruption policy, guidelines and processes. 
Employees in positions assessed to be higher-
risk receive training every year and within three

months of entering their positions. Every two 
years, managers and professional employees 
not  in  higher-risk  positions  receive  training. 
Every four years, all ExxonMobil employees are 
required to attend half-day business practices 
reviews that include anti-corruption issues. In 
2012, employees around the world attended 
business practices review sessions. Additionally, 
we monitor legal and regulatory developments 
and advise employees as appropriate.

Control systems
ExxonMobil’s System of Management Control Basic 
Standards defines essential principles and concepts 
that  drive  our  business  controls.  Our  Controls 
Integrity  Management  System  is  designed  to 
assess and measure financial control risks, including 
procedures for mitigating concerns, monitoring 
compliance with standards and reporting results 
to the appropriate operations and management 
groups within ExxonMobil.

Reporting violations
We  reinforce  our  commitment  to  ethics  and 
high  standards  of  business  conduct  with 
the expectation that all employees will report 
suspected  violations  of  laws  and  company 
policies.  The  Corporation  provides  several 
confidential mechanisms for reporting, including 
a 24-hour phone number and a mailing address. 
Employees  can  also  report  violations  during 
supervisory reviews. Confidentiality is respected 
throughout the investigation process subject to 
legal requirements; penalizing or threatening an 
employee for filing a report is prohibited. A Hotline 
Steering Committee comprising security, audit, 
law  and  human  resources  personnel  reviews 
all reports of suspected violations. The Hotline 
Steering Committee provides a quarterly report 
to the Audit Committee, including any violations 
or major issues. Violations lead to disciplinary 
actions, including dismissal.

These  company-wide  financial  controls  meet  or 
exceed the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act and New York Stock Exchange listing standards. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP  conducted  an 
independent assessment that determined our internal 
controls system is effective for financial reporting. 
Regular self-assessments and audits help ensure 
that every operating unit consistently implements 
our controls and standards.

Political Advocacy 
and Contributions
ExxonMobil  continues  to  support  policies  that 
promote stable investment climates for long-term 
business  viability.  ExxonMobil  makes  political 
contributions  to  candidate  committees,  political 
parties, political associations and other political 
organizations as permitted by applicable laws in 
the United States and Canada and as authorized 
by the board of directors. The Corporation refrains 

      Stakeholder Engagement: SIRAN

The Sustainable Investment Research Analyst Network (SIRAN) is a network within the Forum 
for Sustainable and Responsible Investment that supports sustainable investment research 
analysts from more than 50 North American investment firms, research providers and affiliated 
investor groups. SIRAN’s goals include serving as a resource to companies and an educational 
forum for analysts. In 2012, ExxonMobil participated in three SIRAN teleconferences: one on 
operating at Kearl, one discussing stakeholder engagement related to Canada’s indigenous 
people and one on climate policy.

from making political contributions in any nation 
other than the United States and Canada. In 2012, 
Exxon Mobil Corporation contributed a total of 
$282,400 to legislative and gubernatorial candidates 
and caucuses in 15 states. Information about our 
Political Activities Policy and Guidelines and an 
itemized list of corporate political contributions to 
national political organizations and state candidates 
and caucuses is available on our website. 

ExxonMobil’s employee- and retiree-shareholder-
funded political action committee (PAC) disbursed 
$1,064,000 to federal candidates in 2012. Based 
on the 2011–2012 election cycle contributions, CQ 
Moneyline listed the ExxonMobil PAC No. 86 in 
size compared with other PACs. Among corporate 
PACs, the ExxonMobil PAC ranked No. 39 in terms 
of receipts from employees and retiree shareholders 
and No. 33 in total contributions to candidates. All 
rankings are compiled from publicly available data 
filed with the Federal Election Commission. 

ExxonMobil, like many U.S. companies, labor unions 
and other entities, lobbies the U.S. Congress and 

state legislatures and complies fully with regulations 
by reporting federal lobbying expenses in quarterly 
disclosure reports to Congress. In 2012, ExxonMobil 
reported lobbying expenses of $12.97 million. CQ 
Moneyline ranked ExxonMobil No. 22 for lobbying 
expenses.  We  lobbied  on  a  number  of  public 
policy topics, including energy policy, trade, taxes, 
pipeline safety, security and climate policy. There is 
widespread interest from many constituent groups 
on how the United States pursues sound national 
energy policy. We anticipate and look forward to 
many active discussions with those who have an 
interest in this area.

ExxonMobil also engages with trade associations 
at national, state and local levels. Participation in 
these organizations helps support our positions 
on issues critical to shareholder interests. Some 
of the support we provide to trade associations 
may be used for lobbying activities. ExxonMobil 
requires trade associations to report to us the 
portion of dues used for lobbying purposes, and 
we include these amounts in quarterly public 
Lobby Disclosure Act filings.

The  global  community’s  shared  goals  for  economic  prosperity 
and progress cannot be achieved without access to energy. In the 
countries where we operate, we seek to contribute to economic 
development, creating long-term benefits for local communities 
and for our business. 

Economic Growth
History demonstrates that energy demand and 
economic growth go hand in hand. More than 
1 billion people worldwide have no access to a 
reliable source of energy. Improving availability 
of energy supplies helps develop economies and 
enhance livelihoods. Development barriers are 
complex, and the private sector is limited in its 
ability to address them. We need the creation of 
business frameworks that enable local economies 
to thrive through skills development, job creation 
and opportunities for investment. 

Partnerships  and  collaborations  can  also 
facilitate economic progress and help steward 
development targets, such as the United Nations 
Millennium Development Goals, which range from 
environmental sustainability and combatting HIV/
AIDS, malaria and other diseases, to promoting 
gender  equality,  empowering  women  and 
achieving universal primary education.

National Content
As we develop oil and gas resources to meet the 
world’s growing energy needs, we work to build 
and sustain local economic growth and improve 
social  conditions.  This  defines  our  national 
content approach.

We work collaboratively with host governments 
and other stakeholders to implement our national 
content initiatives, which include developing a 

local workforce and supplier base, and making 
strategic community investments. We provide 
detailed information on ExxonMobil’s strategic 
community investments at both the country and 
corporate level on page 64 of this report. 

To ensure a systematic, long-term approach, 
we integrate national content into overall project 
planning and execution through the ExxonMobil 
Capital Projects Management System (EMCAPS); 
see page 18.

Our National Content Guidelines, Strategies and 
Best Practices contain the key elements of a national 
content strategy and plan; models and tools for the 
successful development of national content; and 
roles and responsibilities at the corporate, country 
and project levels. A unique, fit-for-purpose, project-
specific National Content Plan is required for new 
Upstream projects in emerging markets. 

We operate in many countries throughout the 
world, each with different needs, challenges and 
requirements. Therefore, we aim to create and 
implement successful National Content Plans 
and strategies by considering local factors, such 
as regulatory requirements, development goals, 
stakeholder expectations, infrastructure, social 
capacity and the business environment. During 
2012,  we  updated  EMCAPS  national  content 
requirements to include broader socioeconomic 
objectives, such as human rights, project impact 

51

mitigation  and  community  relations.  We  also 
worked on integrating national content into key 
project planning and execution processes. For 
example, we now regularly gather and exchange 
national  content  best  practices  and  lessons 
learned among our project teams. 

Workforce Development
We  have  a  responsibility  to  build  a  legacy  of 
economic progress in all places where we operate 
by developing a globally competitive workforce 
and maximizing local employment opportunities. 
Our national content programs help us overcome 
obstacles in identifying and attracting skilled 

labor and professionals, matching workforce 
skills to business requirements and retaining 
and developing local technical and management 
excellence over the long term. 

Local hiring
While local employment helps us meet our hiring 
needs, it also advances economic development 
and  education  in  the  countries  where  we 
operate. To find qualified individuals, we conduct 
on-campus recruiting and employee networking, 
attend  trade  shows  and  utilize  referrals  and 
external search firms — all good practices in 
the  industry.  Such  efforts  have  brought  the

percentage of nationals in our workforce in Chad 
and Cameroon to nearly 88 percent. In addition:

•  In Angola, 78 percent of our personnel are 
Angolan, 24 percent of whom are women. 
•  In  Malaysia,  95  percent  of  personnel  are 
Malaysian, 32 percent of whom are women. 
Additionally, 90 percent of managers and 
supervisors are Malaysian and 19 percent 
of managers and supervisors are women. 
•  In  Nigeria,  92  percent  of  employees  are  
local,  14  percent  of  whom  are  women;  
17 percent of local staff are in supervisory 
and managerial positions.

•  In Indonesia, 89 percent of employees are local,  
31 percent of whom are women; 14 percent of 
local staff are in supervisory and managerial 
positions.

Russian nationals make up more than 80 percent 
of the workforce at our Sakhalin operations, but 
we are facing a number of challenges to achieving 
our 90 percent nationalization target (see page 56). 
The pool of qualified engineering and technical 
specialists is limited, and the competition for 
local talent is strong. In order to develop and 
retain a diverse and skilled workforce, we conduct 
extensive searches in other regions of Russia, and 
provide critical training, experience and mentoring 
to ensure that local staff reach required levels of 
expertise. We also advance the skills and industry 
knowledge of many of the host country nationals 
we hire by providing training opportunities and 
expatriate assignments in other countries.

Where  applicable,  our  contracts  include 
requirements to hire and train a national workforce. 
We work collaboratively with our suppliers and 
contractors to overcome challenges related to the 
availability of qualified candidates and in-country 
training capabilities.

residence) share their expertise, train and mentor 
nationals for operational and leadership roles. 
In addition, a large number of expatriates from 
company  locations  around  the  world  are  on 
development assignments in other countries to 
enhance their skills. They will share the lessons 
learned on their return to their own country, further 
enhancing local capacity. In 2012, expatriates 
accounted for approximately 5 percent of our 
global workforce. 

Training and development
We strive to provide our employees with career 
opportunities and training that are the best in the 
industry, encouraging growth and achievement. 
We provide education and skills development 
through  a  proven  global  training  curriculum 
customized to our operational environment. Over 
the long term, this helps us develop competent and 
committed employees fully prepared to meet future 
business needs both locally and around the world.

      Up Close: A Decade of Workforce 
      Development in Chad

ExxonMobil and our affiliates have been working on the Chad production and Chad/Cameroon 
pipeline projects since 2002. Over the years, we have seen significant development in local 
capacity,  in  part  due  to  our  comprehensive 
training programs. For example, our Business 
Skills Training Program helps prepare Chadian and 
Cameroonian staff for management and leadership 
positions. Since its inception in 2003, more than 
900 employees have participated in the program. 
The  training  consists  of  project-based  and 
interactive classes on topics ranging from business 
writing to effective teamwork to problem-solving. 
The success of the program is evident by the fact 
that many participants have been promoted to 
supervisory or management roles. As of 2012, 
more than 50 percent of the projects’ supervisors 
are Chadian and Cameroonian nationals.

In 2012, Chadians and Cameroonians made up approximately 88 percent of our total workforce 
in these two countries and almost 80 percent of them are employed in the semi-skilled, skilled 
or supervisory job categories.

Another example of long-term capacity building is the Technical Trainee Program, now in its 11th 
year. In the first class of 2001, Thierry Njip and 21 other candidates were hired to be pipeline 
operators. Training consisted of one year of paid study at a university in northern Cameroon, 
followed by one year of on-the-job instruction in the United States. After graduation, Thierry 
worked as a pump station operator trainee, mentored by an expatriate. More than a decade later, 
Thierry is still with ExxonMobil and was recently promoted to maintenance field superintendent. 
Eighteen members of his class are also still employed with ExxonMobil; most are in senior roles. 

“The training we received at Cameroon Oil Transportation 
Company Consortium (COTCO) was very important for our 
success here. Those two years I spent as a trainee were 
some  of  the  best  years  of  my  life.  I  believe  this  project 
has already delivered a lot to Cameroon — for example, 
in public health efforts like fighting malaria, in community 
outreach efforts and in creating local jobs. The company’s 
philosophy of honesty, fairness and ethics stands out.” 

 — Thierry Njip, field superintendent

gas project includes more than 8,400 Papua New 
Guinean workers, and they make up approximately 
40 percent of the total construction workforce 
for the project. In 2011, the first group of trainees 
began operations and maintenance technician 
training. They have now completed their advanced 
skills training in Nova Scotia, Canada. Shortly 
after returning, the 62 trainees began on-the-job 
training, including mentoring from experienced 
operations and maintenance personnel in Papua 
New Guinea. ExxonMobil also aims to develop and 
hire Papua New Guinean nationals in other fields. 
For example, several environmental field advisors 
were appointed to full-time positions with Esso 
Highlands Limited in 2012.    

In Kazakhstan, continuous training and devel-
opment  of  national  staff  remains  a  primary 
long-term  focus.  In  2012,  we  spent  a  total  of  
1,554 hours and more than $224,000 delivering 
training to 34 employees, 26 of whom were women. 
We provided technical and general training, as well 
as international training assignments to ensure 
long-term development of local staff. ExxonMobil 
employees in Kazakhstan are also gaining valuable 
expertise on international assignments in Australia, 
Canada, Kurdistan, Norway and the United States.

Supplier Development
In  addition  to  developing  a  local  workforce, 
ExxonMobil  works  to  develop  local  suppliers, 
which  further  boosts  host  country  economic 
development and supports our business objectives. 
We promote local capacity building by helping local 
suppliers meet our prequalification requirements, 
providing training for entrepreneurs and creating 
business opportunities for local small and medium 
enterprises. Our goal is to establish and maintain 
a reliable, sustainable and globally competitive 
supply chain wherever we operate. 

We sometimes face difficulties obtaining local 
suppliers due to a lack of capabilities and limited 
local  business  expertise.  To  overcome  these 

53

issues in Angola, Esso Angola, along with several 
other oil and gas companies, helped establish 
a local business center, known as Centro de 
Apoio  Empresarial,  to  administer  Angola’s 
Supplier  Training  Initiative  (STI).  STI  enables 
local suppliers to participate more effectively  
in  the  competitive  bidding  processes  by  
helping  them  develop  adequate  business 
plans, build relationships with the procurement 
departments  of  oil  and  gas  companies,  and 
improve their contract management capabilities. 
Through  STI,  companies  or  individuals  can 
receive training, consulting and mentoring. To 
date, STI has trained 248 suppliers. Of these, 
150 have met ExxonMobil’s rigorous qualification 
standards to become certified bidders. More than  
1,650 additional suppliers are in the process of 
working with STI to become future suppliers.  

In Indonesia, we initiated a similar program to 
educate potential suppliers about our bidding 
process  and  provide  training.  Working  with 
the  local  government,  ExxonMobil  held  the 
first  session  in  November  2012,  targeting 
approximately 80 local suppliers. The session 
helped educate vendors on the prequalification 
program  and  local  content  requirements  to 
enable them to register for Mobil Cepu Limited’s 
potential bidder list. To see how we are developing 
suppliers in Sakhalin, see page 56.

Supply Chain Management
Third parties providing services to ExxonMobil 
can impact our operations and reputation. We 
rely on more than 160,000 suppliers of goods 
and services. Because our global reach expands 
well beyond our fence lines, we seek and develop 
relationships  with  suppliers  that  uphold  our 
commitment to operational integrity. 

Procurement process
Our supply chain management process begins 
when  any  of  ExxonMobil’s  business  lines 
identifies operational or project needs requiring 

the procurement of third-party goods, services or 
materials. We apply a standardized procurement 
approach that allows our operations to share the 
same rigorous standards, accountability and 
good practices worldwide. Our procurement staff 
is trained to conduct supplier prequalification 
assessments (which include anti-corruption due 

diligence where appropriate), perform restricted-
parties  screening  and  incorporate  standard 
legal terms and conditions into contracts. After 
prequalification, our procurement professionals 
communicate project expectations or operational 
requirements that a potential or existing supplier 
must meet. 

ExxonMobil promotes opportunities to advance local manufacturing and workforce capacity. Above, Nigerian workers 

celebrate the completion of the first of three wellhead platforms developed entirely in Nigeria. 

      Up Close: Nigeria Supply Chain Development

Limited manufacturing capacity and lack of skilled workers have been obstacles to expanding 
our local supplier base in Nigeria. After many years of development and proactive engagement 
with local manufacturers, we celebrated the completion of the first of three floating platforms 
developed entirely in Nigeria. ExxonMobil implemented the project with the objective of 
developing local engineering workforce capability and increasing the capacity of local fabricators. 
The project was performed to international standards, including more than 4.3 million hours 
worked with no lost-time safety incidents. To complete the project, 30 locals were trained to 
National Content Development and Monitoring Board standards in technical skills like welding 
and fitting. The project delivered on the government’s objectives of increasing the country’s 
oil and gas production, employing local workers, and ensuring the long-term availability and 
viability of in-country goods and services. The results demonstrate the long-term value of 
increasing Nigeria’s local engineering, welding and fabricating workforce capacity. Platforms 
were successfully placed in permanent offshore locations, and drilling began in late 2012.

Supplier qualifications
ExxonMobil has in place a disciplined qualification 
process for suppliers. Once the business line 
has determined the operational requirements, 
procurement  clearly  communicates  those 
requirements to potential suppliers through the 
proposed contract language. This process is used 
whether ExxonMobil is procuring a pump for a 
refinery, janitorial services at an office building or 
hiring a fabricator to build an offshore structure. 
Potential suppliers and their capabilities are then 
assessed based on operational criticality and level 
of risk associated with the material or service 
required. Considerations include:

•  Health, safety and security requirements
•  Technical qualifications
•  Environmental requirements
•   Design, construction and project assurance 

and procedures

•   Product quality assurance, including product 

stewardship

•   Supplier operational, maintenance and control 

processes

•  Financial qualifications

Additionally,  supplier  selection  takes  into 
account both regulatory and ExxonMobil policies 
regarding  local  hiring,  material  use,  supplier 
diversity, indigenous peoples support, historically 
underutilized segments of the population and the 
local economy. We comply with specific supplier-
related requirements in each country where we 
operate. When selecting a supplier, we evaluate 
the bids submitted and make a determination 
based on quality, technical capabilities and cost. 

When we are procuring a component for a specific 
project, the safety and viability of the project 
may rely on assurances of product quality. For 
example, if we need to purchase pipe for one of 
our Upstream projects, we perform extensive 
analysis and testing to confirm the pipe complies 
with project specifications.

Supplier diversity
We cultivate diversity across our supply chain 
through  our  U.S.-based  Supplier  Diversity 
Program.  This  program  proactively  includes 
qualified minority- and women-owned business 
enterprises (MWBEs) in our procurement sourcing 
process. In 2012, we purchased materials and 
services worth $788 million directly from MWBEs. 
An additional $213 million was leveraged through 
contracts where suppliers purchased from MWBEs 
on our behalf, for a total annual expenditure of more 
than $1 billion. The Women’s Business Enterprise 
National Council has recognized ExxonMobil as 
one of America’s Top Corporations for Women’s 
Business Enterprises for the past seven years. Our 
Supplier Diversity Program is steadily expanding 
into the international arena through our active 
involvement with WEConnect International and the 
National Minority Supplier Development Council’s 
International Program Advisory Council. Both have 
a mission to identify, certify and develop MWBEs 
in a number of countries outside the United States. 

Procurement transparency
Our suppliers must adhere to local and national 
laws, regulations and the specific requirements 
of  ExxonMobil  policies  and  procedures  on 
safety, health, security and the environment. Our 
Statement on Labor and the Workplace articulates 
our support for the principles of the International 
Labor Organization (ILO) 1998  Declaration on 

      Up Close: North Baton Rouge  
      Industrial Training Initiative

ExxonMobil’s 105-year-old Baton Rouge complex is located in a neighborhood that accounts 
for 13 percent of the city’s population and 30 percent of its homicides. Only 35 percent of the 
neighborhood population has a high school degree, and the unemployment rate is 40 percent. 
Through engagement with our contracting partners and the local community, ExxonMobil identified 
an opportunity to help meet an industry demand for a technically trained workforce and help our 
neighbors secure training and employment.

Launched in August 2012, the North Baton Rouge 
Industrial  Training  Initiative  is  a  collaborative 
effort among the Capital Area Technical College, 
Baton Rouge Community College, ExxonMobil, 
other industrial leaders, non-profit organizations 
and community resource partners. The initiative 
provides selected participants with free training in 
one of three concentrations — pipefitting, welding 
or electrical. The technical college accepted and 
enrolled 59 of the 200 individuals that applied 
for the pilot course, which ran from Oct. 1, 2012, 
to Feb. 18, 2013, and produced 46 graduates, 
exceeding the first-year goal of 45.

Students participating in the North Baton 

Rouge Industrial Training Initiative receive 

tutoring  and  mentoring  from  retired

In  addition  to  technical  training,  the  students 
learned skills that will help them get and keep 
a job after graduation. HOPE Ministries and representatives from stakeholder companies, 
including an ExxonMobil retiree volunteer group, served as mentors and are helping program 
participants understand industry expectations, create resumes and prepare for job interviews. 
Plans are currently in place to replicate the pilot program.

prepare them for future employment. 

“Through  the  leadership  of  Steve  Blume  and  the  entire 
ExxonMobil team, we have been able to bring together a 
diverse group of local industry and community leaders, 
with  the  goal  of  connecting  local  residents  with  career 
opportunities  and  filling  high-demand  jobs.  We  must 
provide our students with the tools they need to succeed...
and when our students succeed, our community succeeds. 
That has been the goal of the North Baton Rouge Training 
Initiative from its inception.”

Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, namely 
the elimination of child labor, forced labor and 
workplace discrimination. Through our regimented 
procurement process, we seek business partners 
who observe similar standards. Purchases arranged 
for by our global procurement organization typically 
include contract language that requires adherence 
to all applicable laws and regulations, which would 
include all laws and regulations regarding safety, 
security, health, the environment and human rights. 
Furthermore, requests for quotations issued by 
our procurement staff typically include clauses 
relating to the prohibition of forced or child labor 
and the payment of wages in accordance with local 
laws. Participants in such tenders are required to 
adhere to those requirements as a condition of 
participating in the tender process.

Supplier monitoring
We use our Operations Integrity Management 
System  (OIMS)  to  manage  risk  across  our 
operations. The OIMS Framework establishes 
expectations for managing and mitigating safety, 
security, health, environmental and social risks 
in every aspect of our business, including our 
supply chain. 

After selecting suppliers, each business line is 
responsible for managing the supplier relation-
ship. Implementing OIMS Element 8, Third-Party 
Services, calls for the monitoring and stewardship 
of third-party performance. We provide feedback 
to suppliers and, when necessary, request that they 
correct deficiencies. In certain cases, we terminate 
the contractual relationship if performance does 
not meet expectations.

Currently,  we  are  exploring  expansion  of  our 
standard  internal  supplier  review  process  to 
include environmental and social responsibility 
compliance. This process will allow us to raise our 
confidence that suppliers are adhering to legal 
and contractual expectations for environmental 
protection and social responsibility.

Transparency
Revenue transparency can be a practical and 
effective  means  to  fight  corruption,  improve 
government accountability and promote greater 
economic stability in developing and developed 
countries around the world. The most successful 
transparency initiatives are those that ensure all 
relevant players in the public and private sectors 
and in civil society are fully engaged and properly 
represented. The initiatives also must respect 
national sovereignty and local norms and apply 
to all companies operating in a country. This is 
why ExxonMobil has supported multi-stakeholder 
engagement to achieve revenue transparency for 
the past decade.

Extractive Industries  
Transparency Initiative
One important global program that encourages 
transparency  and  collaboration  among 
governments,  companies,  civil  society  and 
financial institutions is the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is dedicated 
to  strengthening  governance  by  improving 
transparency and accountability in the extractives 
sector.  Companies  and  country  governments 
participating in EITI separately report payments 
and  revenues,  respectively,  allowing  EITI  to 
reconcile  any  differences  between  the  totals 
and publish validated total government revenues.

ExxonMobil has actively participated in EITI since 
its inception in 2002, at both the secretariat and 
country levels, including continuous participation 
on the EITI board as either a primary or alternate 
member. Our efforts in this area during the past 
year have focused on intensive work together with 
the extractive industry, investor groups and civil 
society representatives to make sound progress 
in the EITI process. Nearly 20 countries where 
we have operations are working on becoming, or 
have become, EITI members. The Corporation is 
supporting the EITI application, validation and 
membership  processes  of  countries  such  as 

Azerbaijan, Cameroon, Chad, Indonesia, Iraq, 
Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Nigeria and Norway, 
and of potential new applicant EITI countries 
including Australia, Colombia, Papua New Guinea, 
Ukraine and the United States. 

In August 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) published new rules for global 
government payment reporting. These rules require 
an unprecedented degree of cost and complexity 
that will generate a significant volume of data from  
publicly traded extractive companies. The rules 
do not apply to state-owned and privately held 
companies not registered with the SEC, and do 
not reconcile government revenues with company 
payments. As a result, the new rules will not enable 
total government extractive industry revenues to 
be gathered or reported, which will limit the extent 
to which this reporting will help improve country 
governance  and  government  accountability. 
Compliance will require companies to design 
and build costly new accounting processes to 
gather, validate and report many different payment 
streams.  Many  key  elements  in  the  rules  are 
undefined or unclear. The SEC estimates the 
cost of compliance for the industry may reach 
$14 billion. 

It is ExxonMobil’s policy to comply with all govern-
mental laws, rules and regulations applicable to its 
business. However, because of the unprecedented 
cost and complexity of these rules, as well as the 
potential for conflict with other laws, ExxonMobil 
is also supporting efforts by the National Foreign 
Trade  Council,  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce, 
Independent Petroleum Association of America 
and American Petroleum Institute to overturn these 
rules so that they can be replaced with a more 
reasonable approach. 

The European Union is also in the process of 
revising  government  revenue  reporting  rules 
through  new  accounting  and  transparency 
directives. ExxonMobil supports efforts of the 

55

International Association of Oil and Gas Producers 
to seek directives that strike a reasonable balance 
between disclosure and economic harm.

We will continue to work constructively with all 
proponents of increased revenue transparency 
toward  policies  and  programs  that  reduce 
corruption and improve governance. Initiatives 
that pursue those goals provide for a more stable 
business climate which, in turn, supports stronger 
and more sustainable economic development in 
the countries where we operate. 

ExxonMobil  is  also  developing  procedures, 
consistent with new SEC rules under the Dodd-
Frank Act, to confirm that any “conflict minerals” 
(currently  including  gold,  tin,  tungsten  and 
tantalum) that may be necessary to the production 
or functionality of our products do not originate 
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or 
adjoining countries.

DEvEloping long-tErm  
capacity in Sakhalin 

Supporting long-term development in the communities where we 
live and work reaps benefits for ExxonMobil and our stakeholders. 

Our  Sakhalin-1  project  in  Russia  is  a  good 
example of the long-term benefits that systematic 
investments can bring. Exxon Neftegas Limited 
(ENL),  a  subsidiary  of  ExxonMobil,  operates 
the  Sakhalin-1  project,  which  is  located  off 
the  northeast  coast  of  Sakhalin  Island  in  the 
Russian Far East. Production of these fields is 
challenged by the presence of pack ice, three- 
to five-feet thick six to seven months out of the 
year, and severe wave activity year-round in an 
active seismic area. Overcoming these daunting 
weather-related barriers, coupled with the need to 
build a complete oil and gas infrastructure in such 
a remote location, has created unique challenges. 

Although  discovered  several  decades  ago, 
the  Sakhalin-1  fields  were  not  developed  until 
new technologies became available as a result 
of  successful  partnerships  between  Russian 
and international companies. After a decade in 
development,  first  production  flowed  from  the 
Chayvo field in early October 2005. Today, Sakhalin-1 
includes the Chayvo, Odoptu and Arkutun-Dagi oil 
and gas fields, with potential recoverable resources 
estimated at 2.3 billion barrels of oil and 485 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas.

As  one  of  the  largest  single  international 
investments in Russia, Sakhalin-1 is expected 
to bring more than $89 billion in taxes, royalty 
payments and the state’s share of oil and gas 
to the country. 

Developing a Local Workforce
Developing a national workforce and supporting 
the community are key factors to the project’s 
ongoing success. Today, ENL and its contractors 
currently employ more than 600 Russian nationals, 
making up more than 80 percent of the Sakhalin-1 
project workforce. 

To  compete  successfully  for  national  workers 
and meet its needs for skilled field personnel, 
ENL  invests  in  the  training  and  development 
of  national  personnel.  ENL  has  recruited 
and  hired  more  than  230  Russian  operations 
technicians  and  engineers  for  its  production 
facilities. Each of the technicians completes a 
multi-year  training  program.  Some  have  been 
sent to ExxonMobil facilities in the United States 
and  Canada  for  hands-on-training.  Currently, 
training  for  operations  technicians  includes 
a  combination  of  classroom  instruction  and 

on-the-job  training  at  Sakhalin-1  facilities.  
These  operations  technicians  and  engineers 
reach early competency milestones required for 
their positions through mentorship and on-the-
job training. In addition to work responsibilities, 
ENL encourages these trainees to take additional 
classes  to  enhance  their  job  skills.  Through 
our  training  programs,  19  Sakhalin-1  trained 
technicians have been promoted to supervisory 
positions,  and  another  four  technicians  took 
on  technical  advisory  roles.  In  2013,  another  
30 trainees are expected to complete the training 
and receive their first assignments with ENL.

In  May  2012,  ENL  completed  a  gravity-based 
structure for the Arkutun-Dagi platform — the 
largest  in  Russia.  More  than  4,000  Russian 
nationals worked on the design and construction 
of the structure.

Developing  local  suppliers  is  also  a  key 
component of our business model. As a direct 
result  of  the  company’s  efforts  to  enhance 
Russian capacity within the Sakhalin-1 project, the 
value of contracts awarded to Russian companies 
during  implementation  has  totaled  about  
$7.9 billion, representing nearly two-thirds of the 
total contracts awarded to date. 

$7.9 billion

in contracts to  
Russian companies

This  ongoing  support  has  allowed  many  
local  suppliers  to  expand  their  businesses.  
For  example,  the  SFERA  Limited  Liability 
Construction  Firm  has  been  in  the  Sakhalin 
construction  industry  since  1988.  SFERA  
started  as  a  building  cooperative  with  only  
30 employees. With mentorship and continued 
business  from  ENL,  SFERA  has  grown  to  
more than 1,500 employees and is now one of 
the  largest  and  most  successful  construction 
companies in Sakhalin. 

ENL  encourages  collaboration  between 
international  service  providers  and  local 
companies to ensure local suppliers can meet the 
key performance criteria of ExxonMobil projects 
and execute safe and efficient operations. 

Training 
Our  technical  training  programs  for  suppliers 
and  contractors  continue  to  reach  more 
Sakhalin  residents.  In  2012,  we  hosted

contractor-development workshop for Russian-
owned-and-operated businesses and companies 
interested  in  becoming  contractors  for  the 
project.  A  total  of  83  companies  registered 
for  the  workshop,  95  percent  of  which  were 
locally based. They represented a wide range of 
industries, including construction, transportation, 
catering, electrical, medical and other oil- and 
gas-oriented businesses. 

Providing  Sakhalin’s  indigenous  residents  
with a voice in the project has been a primary  
goal of ENL. Local reindeer herders were hired 
to assist environmental scientists and rendered 
invaluable cooperative efforts in the development 
of  the  Odoptu  field.  In  2009,  they  were  also 
trained  and  certified  as  oil  spill  responders.  
As local hunters and fishermen, they understand 
the coastal environment and can support the 
Sakhalin-1 oil spill response team in an emergency. 
Approximately  20  indigenous  residents  are  
trained in Arctic spill response.

Building Infrastructure
In  addition  to  government  revenues  that  will  
flow into infrastructure, the project is contributing 
directly to infrastructure enhancements, including 
improved roads, bridges, airport and seaport 
facilities and public medical facilities. 

Since 2001, ENL and the Sakhalin-1 Consortium 
have  provided  more  than  $190  million  for 
community infrastructure projects. New bridges 
and  improved  roads  in  North  Sakhalin  make  
the  six-hour  trip  from  Nogliki  settlement  to 
Okha city safer and faster. Advanced medical 
equipment provided to hospitals ensures timely 
emergency response for Sakhalin-1 personnel 
and local communities.

Supporting Communities
ExxonMobil also supports education, health and 
cultural programs in the Sakhalin region. In 2012, 
ENL and the Sakhalin-1 Consortium contributed 
$5 million to the Sakhalin Technical Oil and Gas 
Institute to support students preparing for careers 
in the oil and gas industry. The donation helped 
fund the purchase of a wide range of laboratory 
equipment and enabled Sakhalin State University 
to open an oil-and-gas-formations physics lab and 
a drilling-well-training simulation center. 

ENL provides medical equipment to local clinics 
and  hospitals,  including  modern  ultrasonic 
examination and diagnostic equipment. To date, 
ENL has contributed more than $11 million to 
community programs that support education, 
infrastructure, health care, civic organizations 
and the arts.

To  encourage  the  development  of  small-  and 
medium-sized  local  businesses,  ENL  and 
Sakhalin-1  Consortium  partners  support  a 
microcredit program focused on microfinance 
loans and business training. More than $700,000 
was contributed for microfinance loan funding 
that  created  or  sustained  more  than  1,000 
local  jobs  and  200  businesses  on  Sakhalin 
Island and in the Ulchi District of Khabarovsk 
Krai. Between 2010 and 2012, ENL continued 
providing support and funding training for local  
business people.

      Up Close: Supporting Energy Infrastructure  
      Improvements in Sakhalin

ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin-1 project has helped deliver critical energy supplies to many parts of 
Eastern Siberia and Russia’s Far East, areas that previously lacked access to stable energy 
sources. After the Russian government started the Far East Gasification Program to help 
bring infrastructure to these remote areas, ENL entered into the first-ever production-sharing 
agreement with domestic gas suppliers in 2005. Since then, Sakhalin-1 has delivered more 
than 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Far East domestic customers. As a result, many 
small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as public utility companies that supply heat and 
electric power to residents, use a more environmentally friendly energy source.

ExxonMobil strives to have a positive impact on the communities 
where  we  operate.  Stakeholder  engagement  demonstrates  our 
fundamental respect for human rights and our belief that strong, 
informed communities lead to a stable business environment.

Community Impacts 
and Relationships
Through  effective  communication  and 
consultation,  ExxonMobil  seeks  to  establish 
and  maintain  community  relationships  while 
actively promoting respect for human rights. We 
address socioeconomic issues by adhering to 
corporate policies and expectations (see page 
47),  complying  with  host-country  regulatory 
requirements, applying universally recognized 
principles, engaging with external groups (see 
page 7) and building local economic capacity 
(see page 51).

In 2012, we approved our Upstream Socioeconomic 
Management Standard for use across the Upstream 
companies. The Standard provides a set of best 
management practices and minimum expectations 
when managing the socioeconomic considerations 
throughout the Upstream life cycle. Implementing 
the  Standard  helps  us  identify  considerations 
and risks early. We then develop and implement 
appropriate  avoidance  measures.  We  believe 
a  consistent  approach  helps  our  employees, 
contractors  and  partners  effectively  manage 
socioeconomic issues and maintain our global 
license to operate. 

In 2012, ExxonMobil established an Upstream 
Socioeconomic  Management  Functional 
Advisory Team, comprised  of various functional 
and  Upstream  company  representatives.  This 
team  meets  quarterly  to  review  and  discuss 
strategy,  alignment  and  direction  regarding 

socioeconomic  considerations.  We  also 
launched a system to capture lessons learned 
from any incidents with socioeconomic causes 
and  effects.  When  incidents  happen,  it  will 
be  beneficial  for  these  causes  and  effects  to 
be identified to help improve how we manage 
socioeconomic impacts. 

Identifying  
Socioeconomic Aspects
At  ExxonMobil,  risk  management  shapes 
our  business  and  investment  decisions.  This 
includes  evaluating  and  managing  the  risks 
and  opportunities  related  to  social,  health, 
environmental, economic and cultural matters. 
When  starting  major  Upstream  projects,  we 
conduct an Environmental, Socioeconomic and 
Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA) to identify 
key risks that we might encounter throughout the  
asset life cycle and develop strategies to manage 
or mitigate these risks appropriately. A key aspect 
of conducting an ESHIA involves engaging directly 
with affected communities, relevant governmental 
agencies, international organizations and local  
non-governmental organizations as appropriate 
to solicit feedback on a project and gain information 

For the past decade, 
ExxonMobil has actively

that can be used to improve the project or its 
execution. As part of the process, stakeholders 
are given the opportunity to review and comment  
on ESHIA drafts.

Since  2007,  ExxonMobil  has  undertaken 
or  participated  in  nearly  110  ESHIAs  for  
projects and activities around the world, ranging 
from single-well exploration drilling programs 
to  new  technology  evaluation  pilots  to  large 
development  mega-projects.  Conducting  
ESHIAs  is  integral  to  successful  project 
implementation  and  developing  long-term, 
positive relationships in the communities where 
we operate.

Respecting Human Rights
Our  approach  to  human  rights  is  consistent 
with the policy framework outlined in the 2008  
report  of  John  Ruggie,  the  United  Nations 
Special  Representative  on  Business  and 
Human  Rights.  That  framework  recognizes 
the  distinctly  different  roles  of  government 
and  business  with  regard  to  human  rights 
—  the  government’s  duty  to  protect  human  
rights  and  corporations'  responsibility  to  
respect them.

The United Nations Framework and Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights was 
released in 2011 to provide further guidance on 
implementing the “protect, respect, remedy” 
framework. These Guiding Principles emphasize 
operational due diligence: corporations should 
be  aware  of  potential  adverse  impacts  and 
implement  prevention  measures.  In  2012, 
the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC) 
published  revised  Performance  Standards 
on Environmental and Social Sustainability to 
reflect the Guiding Principles.

In 2012, the International Petroleum Industry 
Environmental  Conservation  Association 
(IPIECA) continued efforts to coordinate an 
industry position on the Guiding Principles,  
with  a  focus  on  industry  due  diligence. 
ExxonMobil  recognizes  the  importance  of 
successful voluntary initiatives and supports 
IPIECA’s effort to address the expectations  
of the Guiding Principles for the oil and gas 
industry proactively.

Providing human rights training 
Our human rights awareness training program is 
based on ExxonMobil guidelines, practices and 

2012 Corporate Citizenship Report 
 
Human Rights and Managing Community Impacts

priorities. Training focuses primarily on employee 
awareness, company policies and approaches, 
company  resources  and  our  commitment  to 
respect human rights. Each session also includes 
information  on  the  Voluntary  Principles  on 
Security and Human Rights, the requirements of 
our Framework on Security and Human Rights and 
implementing the Framework in a given country.

We pursue a risk-based approach to providing 
human  rights  training  in  our  highest-priority 
operating  areas.  It  is  ExxonMobil’s  intent  to 
facilitate the training of employees working on 
projects globally and to broaden the scope of those 
designated for training. In 2012, we coordinated 
training for approximately 50 site-based security 
personnel in Nigeria, Chad and Sakhalin, and more 
than 100 employees at our annual conference for 
socioeconomic professionals. We also continued 
to evaluate methodologies to reach additional 
personnel and expand the content of this training. 
Our plans include development of computer-based 
modules to provide greater access to security 
and human rights training. We will also evaluate 
combining  this  training  with  reviews  of  other 
business practice standards. 

Policies and labor practices
Our commitment to human rights extends to our 
workforce and is supported by our Standards 
of Business Conduct and Statement on Labor 
and the Workplace, which is consistent with the 
spirit and intent of the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Labor Organization (ILO) 1998 Declaration on 
Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work, 
specifically the elimination of child labor, forced 
labor and workplace discrimination. Employees 
are  required  to  comply  with  all  employment 
policies and practices. 

We seek business partners that observe similar 
standards.  Our  contract  language  requires 
adherence to all national laws and regulations. 

We prescreen suppliers and mandate compliance 
with  all  applicable  laws,  which  include  those 
regarding business practices and human rights. 
Formal requests for quotations typically include 
clauses relating to the prohibition of forced or child 
labor and the payment of wages in accordance 
with all local laws.  

Addressing Security Concerns
Security and respect for human rights can and 
should be compatible. ExxonMobil is committed 
to ensuring the security of company personnel 
and operations in a manner that respects human 
rights and fundamental freedoms.

Framework on Security and Human Rights
For  the  past  decade,  ExxonMobil  has  actively 
participated in the Voluntary Principles on Security 
and  Human  Rights,  a  forum  that  provides  for 
discussion  and  information  sharing  among 
extractive  industry  companies,  governments 
and  non-governmental  organizations.  These 
Voluntary  Principles  affirm  the  constructive 
role that businesses can play in supporting and 
advancing human rights and security.

In 2012, IPIECA completed an Implementation 
Guidance Tool for introducing these Principles in 
countries that are not members of the Voluntary 
Principles  on  Security  and  Human  Rights. 
ExxonMobil personnel attended implementation 
workshops in Indonesia and Peru.

Most countries with ExxonMobil operations rely 
on the use of unarmed private security providers. 
However, in some instances, host governments 
provide security personnel. In these cases, the 
expectation to uphold human rights remains the 
same. ExxonMobil’s Statement and Framework 
on Security and Human Rights helps implement 
the  Voluntar y  Principles.  The  Statement  
and  Framework  includes  guidance  on  working 
with  host  government  security  personnel, 
instituting  memoranda  of  understanding

      Up Close: Stakeholder    
      Consultation in Chad and Cameroon

Since the Chad/Cameroon pipeline project began in 2002, 
ExxonMobil has held thousands of public consultation sessions. 
In 2012, engagements focused on the 242 villages near the 
pipeline. With increasing development activity in the countries, 
active and early communication with villagers is a priority. During 
these meetings, villagers received relevant information about 
the pipeline right of way, including how to identify hazards, 
safe  farming  practices  and  key  points  of  contact.  Project 
staff also took the opportunity to provide villagers with health 
messages about cholera, currently a serious concern in Chad 
and Cameroon.

regarding host government-assigned security 
personnel,  developing  approaches  for 
interacting  with  private  security  providers, 
and reporting and establishing recordkeeping 
templates.  Approximately  99  percent  of  our 
private  security  personnel  contracts  include 
requirements to address human rights concerns.

Establishing  strong  partnerships  with  the  
local  community  is  the  foundation  of  the  
Papua  New  Guinea  liquefied  natural  gas 
project’s  security  strategy.  We  have  faced  
some  challenges  and  delays  from  work  
stoppages due to community disruptions and 
land access issues. We address these challenges 
through the implementation of our Security Plan 
and  work  done  by  our  land  and  community 
affairs  team  to  engage  with  communities 
directly.  Consistent  with  expectations  set  out 
in a Memorandum of Understanding between 
the  Royal  Papua  New  Guinea  Constabulary  
and  Esso  Highlands  Limited,  Papua  New  
Guinea  government  security  personnel  are  to 
receive  appropriate  training,  including  human 
rights  awareness  training.  We  continue  to 
encourage  assigned  government  security 
personnel to provide human rights awareness 
training  to  personnel  supporting  community 
policing  initiatives  near  project  areas.  Project  
personnel also work with project contractors to 
ensure workers have the appropriate training, 

tools and support to perform their duties safely 
and effectively.

Consultation with Stakeholders
We aim to help develop human, social and economic 
capacity in a way that benefits people, communities 
and our business. Achieving this goal requires 
collaborative partnerships and active consultation 
with a range of stakeholders. Our Best Practices 
in External Affairs (BPEA) governs our community 
awareness programs, government relations and 
national content development. The BPEA process 
helps us identify the specific needs, expectations 
and interests of host communities and align these 
needs with our community investment efforts.  

Through early external stakeholder engagement, 
we are able to identify community concerns and 
implement mitigation measures during the project 
planning phase. By attempting to address these 
issues up-front, we are able to minimize community 
concerns throughout the life of the project.

Ensuring mutual understanding, trust and respect in 
our stakeholder relationships means that interested 
parties are represented as project agreements are 
established. Once a project starts, we provide 
local groups and individuals with a communication 
channel to voice and resolve concerns related to 
a development project without fear of retribution.

Standard includes provisions for establishing a 
systematic and transparent grievance process.

For example, at our Papua New Guinea liquefied 
natural  gas  project,  we  apply  an  approach 
consistent with IFC Performance Standards to 
identify  and  manage  community  grievances. 
The  project  provides  numerous  mechanisms 
for receiving grievances from members of the 
community, such as the use of grievance cards 
by the project team when they are interacting 
with communities. The public can also submit 
grievances  in  writing,  in  person  or  over  the 
telephone. As may be expected with a project 
of this scale and complexity, and in a country 
with customary land rights, many community 
concerns  relate  to  compensation  for  land 
access. Additionally, community members raised 
concerns about environment- and economic-
related issues. 

We review all grievances and capture them in 
a  centralized  database  that  coordinates  and 
manages grievances through to their closure. 
Once a grievance is closed, the project team 
evaluates the effectiveness of the resolution. 
The team also conducts weekly reviews of the 
grievance process looking for trends, lessons 
learned and opportunities for improvement. 

As activities continue in Papua New Guinea, the 
project team has been engaging with communities 
to  build  relationships  and  trust  to  ensure  all 
grievances are addressed both appropriately 
and in a timely manner.

principles of the ILO Convention 169 Concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries,  the  United  Nations  Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the IFC 
Performance  Standards  on  Environmental 
and Social Sustainability and the World Bank 
Operational  Policy  and  Bank  Procedure  on 
Indigenous Peoples. Our projects and operations 
in  Alaska,  Cameroon,  Canada,  Papua  New 
Guinea and Sakhalin Island all involve working 
in communities of indigenous peoples. Often, the 
first consultation with any group of indigenous 
people is to determine how they prefer to be 
engaged. Each community establishes its own 
preference for how often members meet with us, 
for how long and whom the community chooses 
to represent its wishes. 

At Kearl in Alberta, Canada, Imperial Oil consulted 
with First Nations’ Industry Relations Corporations 
to develop a Reclamation Planning Group. This 
group,  which  seeks  First  Nations’  input  on 
the Kearl Closure and Reclamation Plan, has 
improved our understanding of the Aboriginal 
cultural and historical connection to the land and 
has helped formulate a more holistic reclamation 
approach that now features activities, such as the 
selection of native plants like beaked hazelnut and 
muskeg tea, for reclaimed areas. We also continue 
to assess a recommendation to create islands 
in a man-made lake to help moose protect their 
calves. This unique initiative is not only improving 
relationships  and  enhancing  the  company’s 
reputation, but is facilitating local stakeholder 
input at the start of the project.

Indigenous peoples 
ExxonMobil  is  committed  to  engaging  with 
indigenous  communities  in  a  manner  that  is 
respectful of their cultures and customs. Through 
open  consultation,  we  work  to  understand 
and incorporate indigenous perspectives into 
project planning, design, execution and ongoing 
operations. Our approach is consistent with the 

Similarly, in Kaktovik, Alaska, we regularly engage 
with the 300 residents of this local indigenous 
community regarding the operations of our North 
Slope Point Thomson Project. The Kaktovik-Point

from Kaktovik and ExxonMobil, meets several 
times  a  year.  We  also  conduct  community 
meetings open to all residents twice a year to

      Stakeholder Engagement: Socially Responsible Investors

We were asked:
Does ExxonMobil’s approach to engagement with indigenous people apply to Imperial Oil 
operations and, if so, how? In particular, how are the provisions of international standards and 
conventions reflected in the policies that govern Imperial Oil operations and what programs 
are in place to implement them? 
— Email from a socially responsible investor

Our response:
Imperial’s  approach  is  consistent  with  the  United  Nations Declaration  on  the  Rights  of 
Indigenous Peoples, including free, prior and informed consent in the context of Canadian 
law. While the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted 
by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007, Canada did not support the declaration until 
2010. Canada, in its endorsement, emphasized that it views the United Nations Declaration 
as “a non-legally binding aspirational document which speaks to the individual and collective 
rights of indigenous peoples,” and emphasizes that the Declaration is a “non-legally binding 
document  that  does  not  reflect  customary  international  law  nor  change  Canadian  laws.” 
Based  on  Supreme  Court  of  Canada  rulings,  Aboriginal  people  do  not  have  a  veto  over 
development projects.

The IFC Performance Standards require companies to undertake free, prior and informed 
consent under certain circumstances; for example, in cases of resettlement or significant 
impacts on cultural heritage sites. Imperial’s projects do not result in resettlement; although at 
times, we must work with registered trapline owners to move cabins and compensate for loss 
of fur. There is an established protocol and formula for completing this in western Canada, 
including consent from the trappers.

ExxonMobil complies with legal requirements in every country where we operate. The global 
functional model means that ExxonMobil processes and good practices are shared with each 
affiliate and adopted by its functions, as appropriate. Affiliates will also conduct business in a 
way that is respectful of local customs and traditions and that establishes strong community 
partnerships to secure a local social license to operate.

need for economic development, even after our

Kaktovik Inupiat elders with local youth, using 
aerial  imagery  and  interviews  to  document 
traditional  knowledge.  This  project  will  help 
young  people  understand  the  stories,  values 
and social relations that exist in North Slope 
coastal locations and their contribution to the 
survival, preservation and evolution of Inupiat 
culture. At the same time, it will help connect 
generations and facilitate the sharing of important 
knowledge within and between communities. 
In  Papua  New  Guinea,  we  work  to  preserve  
significant cultural heritage located in the project 
impact area and implement measures that manage 
known cultural heritage resources. To this end, we 
follow a Cultural Heritage Management Plan for our 
project activities and implement a cultural heritage  
tracking system, which collates and manages  
data collected since 2005. Any sites identified  
with  cultural  heritage  components  are  either 
subject to salvage activities or protection from 
disturbance by construction activities. Throughout 
Papua  New  Guinea,  caves,  ponds,  lakes  and  
trees all have deep cultural heritage meanings 
that have been passed down for generations.  
We work closely with clan and tribal leaders to 
identify,  preserve  and  protect  sacred  cultural 
heritage sites. For example, we engaged with the 
Wapiako Takima clan to protect a local spirit lake 
in the Komo region.

Training our construction and field contractor 
personnel is another way we manage potential 
cultural  heritage  impacts.  For  example,  our 
onshore pipeline contractor trained brush-clearing 
crews  on  how  to  recognize  areas  of  cultural 
significance to landowners.

Land use and resettlement
We respect property rights in the countries where 
we operate, including those of traditional land users. 
The IFC-revised Performance Standards, effective 
in 2012, require clients to obtain the free, prior and 
informed consent of indigenous peoples before 
initiating development activities on traditional lands.

Our  Upstream  Socioeconomic  Management 
Standard  includes  expectations  for  securing 
free, prior and informed consultation. We strive 
to  act  consistently  within  the  parameters  of 
free,  prior  and  informed  consent  by  working 
collaboratively  and  transparently  with  local 
communities,  including  indigenous  peoples, 
to  foster  ongoing  support  for  our  activities. 
We minimize involuntary resettlement through  
project design; when resettlement is unavoidable, 
we seek to ensure appropriate restoration of 
the  livelihoods  of  displaced  persons.  In  all 
cases when some resettlement is unavoidable, 
like at our Papua New Guinea liquefied natural  
gas project, we apply international good practices 
aligned with the IFC’s Performance Standards, 
in  conjunction  with  applicable  host-country 
regulatory requirements.

When  physical  and  economic  displacement 
occurs, we develop and implement Resettlement 

Action Plans that include landowner consultation 
and  surveying  and  mapping  of  housing

identify alternatives, or provide special assistance. 
There are a few cases where we have re-routed 
or  chosen  an  alternative  site  as  a  result  of 
resettlement-related sensitivities.

As part of this process, we negotiate appropriate 
compensation  with  affected  landowners  or  
users  in  the  presence  of  an  independent  
advocacy professional. The resettled landowners 
or users then identify a new home and garden 
site. They receive assistance to re-establish a  

household  and  gardens  at  the  new  location, 
including  the  provision  of  rations  until  the 
household  can  re-establish  its  livelihood,  as 
well as the introduction of improved agricultural  
techniques. We conduct livelihood restoration 
activities through the project’s Food and Agriculture 
Program  and  monitor  and  evaluate  progress  
for two years against a pre-resettlement baseline. 
We also have an assessment team identify resettled 
individuals or groups who may be more affected 
by displacement than others. We closely monitor 
these individuals or groups and assign them priority 
resettlement assistance programs. 

ExxonMobil tracks resettled areas based on the 
number of Resettlement Action Plans in place. 
There are some areas that were not conceptualized 
at  the  beginning  of  construction  of  the  
Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project, 
such  as  quarries  or  access  roads.  We  are 
identifying  these  sites  as  construction  moves 

      Up Close: Papua New Guinea’s  
      Food and Agriculture Program

In countries such as Papua New Guinea with traditional landownership tenures, a social 
license to operate is a critical part of our business. We gain license to operate through our 
relationships with local communities, which not only own the land but also reside within the 
area where we operate. We recognize that it is their livelihood environment as much as it is our 
business environment.

The Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project’s Food and Agriculture Program provides 
assistance for displaced or impacted people. Helping families generate income and grow a 
nutritious food supply is the key objective. As many people in Papua New Guinea practice 
subsistence agriculture, the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project has helped many 
resettled families establish gardens through training, as well as providing agricultural tools, 
planting materials for important food staple crops, vegetables and fruit trees, and small livestock, 
such as poultry and pigs. Households also receive training in nutrition and hygiene, and learn 
how to bake products that are then sold in local markets. The benefits of this program have 
extended well beyond resettled households, with community members around the project area 
now also participating in some of the activities.

number of sites accordingly. Thus far in Papua 
New Guinea, 27 locations have been identified 
where resettlement is deemed necessary.

Strategic Community 
Investments
ExxonMobil  invests  in  long-term  social  
challenges that directly impact our business. We 
make strategic community investments at both 
the corporate and country level, and each serves 
different needs. Our signature corporate programs 
focus on advancing economic opportunities for 
women, combatting malaria and other infectious 
diseases in the developing world and improving 
education. Through public-private partnerships 
and ongoing stakeholder engagement, we believe 
we can achieve these shared goals.

Malaria Initiative
Ending  the  spread  of  malaria  requires  an 
integrated  approach,  including  prevention, 
education and treatment. Over the past several 
years, ExxonMobil has emerged as a corporate 
leader in the fight against malaria. Since 2002, 
our funding has supported the distribution of 
13.1 million bed nets, nearly 1.8 million doses 
of anti-malarial drugs, 942,863 rapid diagnostic 
kits, and training for 249,904 health care workers. 
In total, we have reached more than 83 million 
people in 17 countries throughout Africa and 
Asia  with  an  investment  of  $106.6  million.  In 
2012 alone, ExxonMobil provided $12.4 million 
to  20  organizations  for  24  different  projects, 
benefiting 16.7 million people in 10 countries.

Women’s Economic Opportunity Initiative
Investing  in  women’s  economic  participation 
provides long-term benefits to them, their families, 
their  societies  and  their  countries.  In  2012, 
ExxonMobil invested more than $8 million toward 
promoting women’s economic opportunities. 
Through our partnerships, we have reached more 

64

than 20,000 women in 85 countries. Over the 
past seven years, we have invested more than 
$60 million in this global program.

Math and Science Initiative
Globally, a strong focus on education empowers 
communities  and  builds  the  foundation  for 
human progress. Since 2002, we have provided 
nearly $818 million for education programs, with  
$140 million directed specifically toward teacher 
training  programs  in  the  United  States.  Our 
education programs have helped train more than  
72,000 teachers. In 2012 alone, we directed more 
than $116 million toward education initiatives 
worldwide, of which $38 million was dedicated 
to math and science education in the United 
States, with a focus on teacher development, 
teacher training and inspiring kids to pursue these 
critical subjects.

Country-level investments
We focus country-level community investments 
on specific social and economic challenges in 
Reported malaria

the application of our Upstream Socioeconomic 
Management Standard and with our National 
Content Plans (see page 51). Around the world, 
country-specific  investments  address  needs 
ranging  from  community  water  access  to 
inoculations against disease. When determining 
where  and  how  to  invest,  we  consider  the 
development goals of each community, as well 
as the potential benefit to our operations. We 
also monitor conditions in each country where we 
operate and provide emergency support. In 2012, 
we responded to severe flooding in Nigeria, as 
well as to Hurricane Sandy, which hit the eastern 
coast of the United States.

       Up Close: Combatting Malaria in Angola 

With support from ExxonMobil and the Benguela Provincial Malaria 
Control Program, the Benguela Consortium — a collaborative effort 
between Humana People to People, the International Health Organization 
and the Circle Rastafarian of Benguela — has helped reduce reported 
malaria cases and malaria-related deaths in Benguela, a province in 
western Angola. 

The consortium provides families and municipal health posts with 
mosquito nets, organizes community cleanup campaigns in mosquito 
breeding areas, and trains teachers and students in prevention and 
treatment methods. Consortium representatives also host community 
awareness  rallies  aimed  at  educating  local  citizens  on  effective 
prevention techniques. 

Between 2009 and 2011, the Consortium reached more than 178,000 
individuals in the province, and the results have been significant. This team 
effort helped decrease reported malaria cases in Benguela by more than 
44 percent between 2009 and 2011. The number of malaria-related deaths 
decreased by approximately 80 percent during the same time period.

and projects operated by others. In 2012, Exxon Mobil Corporation, our divisions and affiliates and the 
ExxonMobil Foundation provided a combined $216 million in cash, goods and services worldwide. Of that 
total, $120 million supported U.S. communities and $96 million supported communities in other countries.

Through  company-sponsored  volunteer  programs,  more  than  23,200  ExxonMobil  employees 
and  retirees  and  their  families  donated  approximately  776,300  volunteer  hours  to  more  than  
5,300 charitable organizations in more than 40 countries in 2012. Employees and retirees donated 
$40 million through ExxonMobil’s matching gift, disaster relief and employee giving programs. When 
combined with corporate and foundation donations, ExxonMobil, together with our employees and 
retirees, contributed $256 million to community investments worldwide.

Implementing Strategic Community Investments
Country-Led Initiatives: 2012 Highlights

Kazakhstan
Combatting infant morbidity and mortality is one of Kazakhstan’s 
most significant social issues. ExxonMobil Kazakhstan Inc. (EMKI) 
supported the Breathe, Baby project at the Atyrau Regional Perinatal 
Center.  Underweight  babies  —  typically  those  born  at  less  than  
5.5 pounds — are at a greater risk of dying in infancy. EMKI worked 
with the regional health care department of Atyrau to identify equipment 
needed to improve infant survival rates, including breathing machines, 
resuscitation tables, fetal monitors and X-ray devices. In addition, EMKI’s donation funded 
training for medical personnel in perinatal and neonatal practices through a partnership with a 
medical academy in the Ukraine. EMKI also covers the tuition of medical students who commit 
to working in public health care institutions of the Atyrau region for three years after graduation. 
This helps address the area’s lack of specialized medical personnel.

Indonesia
ExxonMobil’s affiliate in Indonesia, Mobil Cepu Ltd. (MCL), launched 
a community-based clean water program to reduce the incidence of 
water-borne diseases and promote healthier living in the Cepu Block 
of Indonesia. During the dry season, many residents in this area lack 
reliable access to clean water. To help manage this program and make 
it sustainable, the community established a committee responsible for 
managing the budget, constructing and monitoring water facilities and 
handling distribution of water. For example, in the Ngasem Village, a new water tower serves 
as the key source of potable water and is distributed to community households through an 
installed pipeline network. Thus far, this program has benefited more than 25,000 community 
members in 17 villages.

Corporate-Level Initiatives: 2012 Highlights

Malaria Initiative
With ExxonMobil support, Malaria No More launched its NightWatch 
program in Chad and Tanzania during 2012, building on successful 
programs in Senegal and Cameroon. NightWatch uses the voices of local 
and international celebrities in nightly reminders urging people to sleep 
under protective mosquito bed nets. A recent evaluation of the Cameroon 
NightWatch program published in Malaria Journal indicates that, among 
Cameroonians with at least one net at home, exposure to the NightWatch 
campaign was associated with a 6.6 percentage-point increase in last-night net use among adults 
and a 12 percentage-point increase among children under age five. Furthermore, the results 
indicate that approximately 298,000 adults and more than 221,000 of their children under age 
five slept under a bed net as a result of knowledge, motivation or a timely reminder provided 
by NightWatch. For more information, see exxonmobil.com/malaria and malariajournal.com.  

Math and Science Initiative
With a $125 million commitment from ExxonMobil, the National Math 
and Science Initiative (NMSI) continues to improve math and science 
education significantly in the United States. Since its inception in 2007, 
NMSI has reached 2.1 million students. NMSI’s Advanced Placement 
(AP) program has been particularly successful, achieving record-setting 
results over the past five years. As of 2012, NMSI had implemented its 
AP program in 462 schools throughout 18 states. After just one year, 
the number of students with qualifying AP math, science and English exam scores increased 
by 79 percent, 11 times the national average. Gains for traditionally underrepresented groups 
have also been substantial — the program increased the qualifying scores of African-American 
and Hispanic students by 107 percent after just one year in the program. For more information, 
see exxonmobil.com/citizenship and nationalmathandscience.org.

Women’s Economic Opportunity Initiative
In 2012, the ExxonMobil Foundation and the Cherie Blair Foundation for 
Women released a comprehensive study examining how mobile phone 
applications and services can help women entrepreneurs develop and 
grow their businesses. The resulting report, Mobile Value Added Services: 
A Business Growth Opportunity for Women Entrepreneurs, outlines 
the main business challenges that women entrepreneurs in Indonesia, 
Nigeria and Egypt face; identifies existing and new mobile value-added 
services that could be used to address these challenges; and prepares a business case for 
scaling up the services that would likely have the greatest impact on women entrepreneurs. 
Based on the research findings, the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women and the ExxonMobil 
Foundation are providing women entrepreneurs in Nigeria and Indonesia with a tailored mobile 
phone application and training. The program will be expanded to Mexico and Tanzania in 2013.
