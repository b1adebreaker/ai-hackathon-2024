LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO

Welcome to the 2013 Corporate Citizenship 
Report. This report is an opportunity to reaffirm 
the commitments we make to our sharehold-
ers, employees, customers and communities 
regarding our corporate citizenship perfor-
mance. We strive to be responsible corporate 
citizens, and our success along that path is 
underpinned by our technological expertise, 
operational excellence, safety performance and 
unwavering ethical standards.

Modern society consumes energy on a much 
wider and more complex scale than ever 
before. Over the coming decades, the world’s 
population is projected to rise from 7 billion to 
nearly 9 billion, and the global economy will 
more than double. As energy needs evolve, 
ExxonMobil will continue investing in the 
research and technology necessary to find, 
develop and deliver energy resources to our 
customers in the most efficient way possible. 
Working together with our stakeholders, 
we can help shape the landscape of energy 
consumption in the future.

ECONOMIC GROWTH

Access to energy is crucial to economic 
prosperity and human progress. In developing 
countries, it is fundamental to reducing pov-
erty, improving health, increasing productivity, 
enhancing competitiveness and promoting 
long-term economic growth. Improving 
access to reliable and affordable energy in 
order to sustain and improve standards of 
living is the biggest and most impactful con-
tribution we make to local communities and 
economies. But, our responsibility to society 
does not end there.

Wherever we do business, we look to establish 
a skilled local workforce through aggressive 
recruitment and world-class training and 
development programs. We continued to 
make significant progress in hiring host coun-
try workers in 2013. For example, in Angola, 
Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia and Nigeria, we 
have established a national workforce that 
on average accounts for 83 percent of our 
workers. We also develop the capacity of and 
utilize local vendors to supply ExxonMobil with 
goods and services. Our goal is to help local 
communities and businesses fuel their econ-
omies and positively contribute to long-term 
economic growth for generations to come. 

COMMITMENT TO SAFETY

At ExxonMobil, our Operations Integrity 
Management System establishes common 
expectations for addressing safety, security, 
health, environmental and social risks. Our 
goal that Nobody Gets Hurt is more than 
just three words; it is a core value that drives 
us to be a successful business, a responsible 
employer and a good neighbor. In 2013, 
ExxonMobil was honored with the Green 
Cross for Safety® medal. Established in 2000, 
the U.S. National Safety Council awards the 
medal to an organization that exhibits safety 
leadership at all levels, boasts an outstanding 
safety record and is committed to improving 
the quality of life in the communities where its 
employees work and live.

The commitment of our nearly 75,000 
employees, as well as our third-party con-
tractors, helped ExxonMobil continue to be 
among the industry leaders again in 2013. 

Compared with 2012, our workforce lost-time 
incident rate decreased by nearly 9 percent. 
Since the inclusion of XTO Energy in 2011, we 
have reduced our workforce lost-time incident 
rate by 45 percent. The unwavering dedi-
cation of every worker allows for continual 
improvement — a goal always at the forefront 
of our safety culture.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 
Careful management of our environmental 
performance, through a focus on operational 
excellence, is an essential responsibility for our 
business. Our Operations Integrity Manage-
ment System helps us align our environmental 
priorities with our business objectives and 
allows us to find new areas of opportunity to 
reduce environmental incidents.

Spill prevention is a core component of 
ExxonMobil’s environmental performance. 
We continually seek to develop and improve 
risk management, operations integrity, spill 
prevention processes and containment capa-
bilities, and, as a result, we had fewer spills in 
2013 compared with 2012.

As always, we welcome input from all of our 
stakeholders at exxonmobil.com/citizenship.

MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES

ExxonMobil is committed to addressing the key challenge of sustainable development — balancing economic growth, social development and environmental protection so future generations are 
not compromised by actions taken today. By designing our approach to corporate citizenship around six key focus areas, we contribute to society’s broader sustainability objectives and manage 
the impact of our operations on local economies, societies and the environment.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND MANAGING COMMUNITY IMPACTS 

Understanding and addressing the interests of societies and communities that may affect, or be affected 
by, our business is critical to our success. As our work continues to extend to remote locations, we must 
constantly find new ways to engage these stakeholders, identify priority issues and develop solutions that 
are beneficial for communities and our business.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE WORKPLACE

The safety and health of our workforce are at the core of our commitment to integrity. In 2013, we  
progressed toward our goal of Nobody Gets Hurt. However, we are still not where we need to be. We  
are focused on continuous improvement.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Our shareholders are varied, and each views our operations differently. We constructively engage with 
shareholders — including labor unions, religious organizations, state pension funds, socially responsible 
investors and institutional shareholders — to identify areas of opportunity and improvement. This engage-
ment includes shareholder dialogues and our annual meeting.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

Ensuring a lasting, positive impact in the places where we do business is an ongoing focus. As supply  
chains become increasingly complex, we continually seek and develop relationships with suppliers that 
uphold our commitment to operational integrity and help us develop local capacity. 

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

It is important for the viability of our business that we understand the potential effects our business has 
on the local environment in the areas where we operate. We conduct impact assessments, stakeholder 
engagement and other due diligence to ensure we operate in a safe, respectful and environmentally  
protective manner.

MANAGING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS

We manage our climate change risks by focusing on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through 
increased energy efficiency, enhanced operations at our facilities and technological innovation. As we work 
to reduce emissions, our challenge is to create solutions without undermining global economic growth.

Corporate Citizenship Report  
is ensuring the content reflects 
ExxonMobil’s most material issues. 
According to the International 
Petroleum Industry Environmental 
Conservation Association (IPIECA), 
material issues for sustainability 
reporting are those that, in the view 
of both the company’s manage-
ment and its external stakeholders, 
have the potential to significantly

ENGAGEMENT

External Citizenship  
Advisory Panel

The External Citizenship Advisory Panel (ECAP) — 
comprising experts in social and environmental  
topics — annually provides an independent review  
of our corporate citizenship activities, including  
the Corporate Citizenship Report.

    View the panel’s statement on this report

In 2013, the ECAP visited our Upstream Research 
Company in Houston, Texas, to discuss our approach 
to operating in the Arctic. The panelists also visited 
our headquarters in Dallas, Texas, to discuss how  
we measure and manage GHG emissions.

Starting in 2014, two new members have joined  
the ECAP. Frank Loy is the former Under Secretary  
of State for Global Affairs at the U.S. Department  
of State, and Sarah Labowitz is the co-director of  
the Center for Business and Human Rights at New 
York University’s Stern School of Business. We  
thank Elizabeth McGeveran and Tim Smith for  
sharing their perspectives with us as members  
of the panel from 2009 through 2013.

ExxonMobil builds relationships with a diverse group of 
stakeholders through timely and transparent communica-
tion. For a company of our size and scope, this is an ongoing 
challenge. Many people, organizations and communities are 
impacted directly by — and have a direct impact on — our 
business. Energy issues are complicated, and our stakeholders 
represent multiple viewpoints. The dialogue we develop with 
our stakeholders helps us understand all points of view and 
maintain a global perspective on our most material issues. This, 
in turn, helps us continue to improve our company and remain 
a responsible corporate citizen.

We use a variety of mechanisms to engage our  
stakeholders, including:

•  Internal and external one-on-one and group dialogues  

and briefings

•  Senior executive speeches

•  Quarterly earnings teleconferences

•  Focus groups

•  Community consultations

•  Email communications

•  Twitter feeds

•  Corporate blog at exxonmobilperspectives.com

•  Publications such as the Corporate Citizenship Report, 

Summary Annual Report and our shareholder magazine, 
The Lamp, as well as community newsletters and content 
on our websites

ENERGY OUTLOOK

Energy supply and demand are significant drivers of the 
global economy, and, as a key player in the energy market, 
we know that our actions have the power to improve lives. 
Technology and energy advances have helped bring about an 
unprecedented improvement in the key indicators of human 
well-being, including incomes, literacy rates and average life 
expectancy in many parts of the world. Going forward, we are 
challenged not only to meet basic needs, but also to improve 
living standards. For that reason, we update our long-term 
energy outlook each year — taking into account the most 
up-to-date demographic, economic, energy and technology 
information available. This analysis serves as a foundation for 
our business strategies and investments. 

The following are highlights from this year’s Outlook  
for Energy:

•  From 2010 to 2040, the world’s population is projected to 

rise from 7 billion to nearly 9 billion, and the global economy 
will more than double. Over that same period, global energy 
demand is likely to rise by about 35 percent, even with  
substantial efficiency gains. Nearly all of the growth will 
occur in non-OECD1 countries. 

•  China and India will account for half of the projected  

growth in global energy demand through 2040. By then, 
nine of the world’s 20 most populous cities — and one of 
every three people on the planet — will be in these nations. 

•  While oil will remain the fuel of choice for transportation, 

natural gas is emerging strongly as a growing fuel of choice 
for multiple sectors. It will be the world’s fastest-growing 
major energy source, with global demand projected to rise 
by close to 65 percent from 2010 to 2040. By roughly 2025, 
natural gas is expected to overtake coal as the second- 
largest energy source, behind oil. 

sources, which will account for one-third of global produc-
tion. During the same period, emerging sources such as oil 
sands, tight oil, deepwater, natural gas liquids and biofuels 
will account for more than 40 percent of global liquids 
supply, with tight oil supply growing more than 10 times 
— faster than any other liquid source. Advances in technol-
ogies, such as those used for well drilling and completion, 
have enabled the energy industry to reach new sources of 
oil and natural gas, while helping to reduce the environmen-
tal impact of energy production.

•  Worldwide electricity use is projected to increase by  

90 percent from 2010 to 2040, with developing countries 
accounting for approximately 85 percent of the growth. 
With an increased trend of people moving from rural  
to urban areas, electricity will likely account for around  
one-third of residential energy demand by 2040.

•  After decades of growth, we expect worldwide energy- 

related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to plateau around 
2030 before gradually declining, despite a steady rise in over-
all energy use. Climate policies that target GHG emissions are 
likely to play a significant role in the world’s energy future by 
affecting people’s energy choices. These policies will likely 
raise electricity costs, slowing demand growth and shifting 
electricity generation away from coal toward lower-emission 
fuel sources like natural gas, nuclear and renewables.

•  Maintaining a robust global energy marketplace is critical to 
meeting rising global energy demand. We expect that about 
half of global liquid fuels demand will continue to be met via 
international trade by 2040, while traded volumes of natural 
gas are expected to be two-and-a-half times the 2010 level 
by 2040.

•  About 65 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies 
through 2040 is expected to be from unconventional

PERFORMANCE DATA

At ExxonMobil, we are focused on continuously improving our performance across our citizen-
ship focus areas. This means assessing performance at many levels of the organization, from 
our operational sites to the business lines. We provide data interpretations where we consider 
the performance trend to be generally desirable (•), undesirable (•) or mixed (•) for applicable 
data. For certain metrics, no interpretation is necessary. For other metrics, we interpret trends 

based on performance over a multiyear period and consider other factors in our assessments, 
such as production volumes and economic climate. We conduct much of this detailed analysis 
at the operational level. When we see unfavorable trends at any level, we identify them and aim 
to correct underlying causes. This report describes in detail our plan for addressing these issues. 
Starting in 2011, performance data include XTO Energy information.

Safety

Safety is more than just a priority 
at ExxonMobil — it is a core value. 
Our safety performance  
in 2013 continued to be among  
the best in the industry.

Regardless of an employee’s job function, all of us at  
ExxonMobil have a common responsibility in every assign-
ment we undertake: identifying, assessing and mitigating 
the risks associated with our operations. The Valdez oil spill 
incident, which occurred 25 years ago this spring, was a turn-
ing point in our history. In its aftermath, we launched a top-
to-bottom review of our operations and then implemented 
our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS), which 
guides the activities of each of our nearly 75,000 employees, 
as well as our third-party contractors. It is embedded in our 
everyday work processes at all levels, and we strive for con-
tinuous improvement.

    Learn more about OIMS

“Leaders establish the vision, communicate the core values 
including safety, provide the tools and resources, engage  
the workforce, monitor progress, adapt to change and  
recognize accomplishments. With the right leadership 
approach, you really can change the culture.”  

— Dan Egging, Sakhalin-1 Safety, Security, Health and  
    Environment Manager

Unfortunately, personnel and process safety incidents 
and near-misses do occur. When they do, we investigate 
what transpired, considering both the actual and potential 

consequences, to determine how to prevent similar incidents 
in the future. Many of our business lines use an in-house 
tool, called the Incident Risk Assessment Tool, to analyze 
the actual and potential consequences and the layers of 
protection in place to prevent the incident from having a 
more serious outcome. We then share each incident through 

our global networks to ensure we implement those lessons 
in our operations around the world. 

A critical element of any comprehensive management system 
approach is honest and objective self-assessment. Without it, 
no system is sustainable. OIMS requires us to audit the health 

Up Close: 
“Mining the Diamond”

To continue improving our safety performance, we must dive 
deeper into safety incidents to understand their contributing 
factors. While the industry rate of total safety incidents has 
continued to decrease in recent years, the serious injury and 
fatality rate has not decreased at the same pace. Many oil  
and gas companies use a traditional safety pyramid to evaluate 
and think about safety incidents. The pyramid represents the 
actual outcome of events that have taken place — not taking 
into account the potential outcomes. Recognizing this  
challenge, ExxonMobil Development Company (EMDC)  
refers to this as a “diamond of knowledge” buried within the  
traditional pyramid, shown to the right.

The diamond is a realization that on any given day, multiple 
incidents under different circumstances could have had a  
much more serious outcome. For example, when someone 
drops a wrench from the top of a drilling rig derrick, the  
outcome is typically a near-miss — an event that does not 
result in an illness, injury or fatality. However, a serious injury or 
fatality could have occurred if, for example, someone  
were standing in the wrong place. 

The “mining the diamond” approach recognizes these  
higher-risk activities and reacts to the potential outcomes  
of an incident, as well as the actual outcomes. For example,  
our Arctic Projects team at EMDC analyzed its safety  
incidents in a recent year and found only a small number  
of actual first aid or near-miss events — noted within the  
diamond below — could have reasonably resulted in a  
serious incident with a life-altering consequence. This  
analysis helped the project team focus on activities that  
had the potential for serious outcomes.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE WORKPLACE2013 Corporate Citizenship Report 
of our risk management approach regularly in each of our 
operating environments. These assessments are performed 
not only by qualified professionals, but also by cross-functional, 
cross-regional teams drawn from our global organization. In 
this way, all workers are responsible for each other’s safety. 
We are also continuing to improve the effectiveness of our 
“life-saving” practices, which we developed to reduce the 
potential for the most severe injuries and fatalities.

PERSONNEL SAFETY
In 2013, we progressed toward our goal of Nobody Gets Hurt. 
When compared with 2012, our workforce lost-time incident 
rate decreased by nearly 9 percent. Since the inclusion of XTO 
Energy in 2011, we have reduced our workforce lost-time 
incident rate by 45 percent. However, we are still not where  
we want to be.

We deeply regret that six workers were fatally injured in five 
incidents related to ExxonMobil operations in 2013. We have 
thoroughly investigated each of these incidents, determined 
the contributing factors and then identified steps to prevent 
similar events in the future. 

We do not believe safety management is proprietary. In collab-
oration with other industry leaders, we are working to improve 
our understanding of ways to prevent fatalities and life-altering 
injuries more effectively.

U.S. National Safety Council 
Honors ExxonMobil

In 2013, the U.S. National Safety Council awarded  
ExxonMobil its prestigious Green Cross for Safety® medal  
“…in recognition of leadership and commitment to corporate 
and social responsibility efforts in safety.” The following is  
part of an interview with ExxonMobil’s Chairman and CEO, 
Rex Tillerson, that appeared in an issue of the Council’s  
Safety+Health magazine.

Why is safety a core value at Exxon Mobil Corporation? 
I’ve heard people say they’ve made safety a “top priority”  
for their company or organization. That’s commendable,  
but I believe that a commitment to safety must run much 
deeper than simply being a priority. Priorities can — and do — 
evolve over time, depending on business conditions and  
other factors. A commitment to safety, however, does not 
change or evolve. A commitment to safety is a value that 
shapes all decision-making at every level. 

Rex Tillerson
ExxonMobil Chairman 
and CEO

What is the biggest obstacle to safety for Exxon Mobil  
Corporation, and how do you work to overcome it? 
The journey to safety excellence requires that we seek  
opportunities to continuously improve our approaches to  
the prevention of injuries and illnesses. In this regard, our  
analysis indicates that human factors continue to be primary  
contributors to incidents. We have learned that this, in part,  
has to do with the personal choices each of us makes to  
either accept or reject risk, or what we call “risk tolerance.”  
The concept of risk tolerance involves first recognizing or  
identifying the risk, understanding it, and lastly, making  
the choice to either accept or reduce the risk. It is in this last 
step, in particular, that we find significant opportunity. To  
facilitate progress in this area, we are continuing to  
reinforce the importance of workers looking out for each  
other in the workplace, encouraging and empowering  
people to intervene on behalf of others when faced with a 
potential at-risk situation. We refer to this as “actively caring.” 
Our focus is on training people to be more effective at inter-
vention, as well as being intervened upon. Both of these —  
risk tolerance and actively caring — may sound very simple,  
but they represent some of the more perplexing challenges  
we face related to human factors in safety management.

injury incidence rate one-fourth of the industry average for U.S. 
construction projects. This is particularly commendable given 
the scope of the work, with more than 20 buildings in various 
phases of construction and up to 4,500 workers on site every 
day. ExxonMobil plans to share lessons learned and incorporate 
best practices at our facilities and projects around the world. 

ExxonMobil merged with XTO Energy in 2010, and since that 
time we have worked together to implement improved safety 
standards in the organization. XTO Energy safety performance 
improved in 2013 compared with 2012. XTO Energy continues 
to implement OIMS and is committed to continuous improve-
ment. In 2013, XTO Energy completed training front-line 
supervisors, superintendents and engineering managers in 
safety leadership, enabling them to promote behavior-based 
safety principles and techniques. 

PROCESS SAFETY

Process safety refers to equipment, procedures and training 
that prevent the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons and 
hazardous substances. Our goal is to prevent incidents with 
the potential for serious injuries and fatalities, widespread  
environmental impact or property damage. Recent industry 
events have further reinforced ExxonMobil’s long-standing 
resolve to excel in process safety management. 

We subscribe to the American Petroleum Institute (API) 
Recommended Practice 754 and International Association  
of Oil & Gas Producers No. 456, which are industry standards. 
These standards define process safety indicators and use a 
process safety incident triangle to represent events from  
Tier 1 through Tier 4. Tiers 1 and 2 represent incidents  
resulting in a loss of primary containment. According to the 
API, loss of primary containment is defined as an unplanned or

uncontrolled release of any material from primary contain-
ment, including nontoxic and nonflammable materials. Tiers 3 
and 4 represent near-misses and leading performance 
measures such as on-time maintenance performance. During 
2013, we had 61 Tier-1 process safety events. After careful 
analysis, we determined human factors, procedures and 
preventive maintenance were the primary contributing 
elements to the occurrence of these events, allowing us to 
develop and enhance prevention strategies more effectively. 

ExxonMobil serves as a contributing member to a variety 
of groups and initiatives focused on improving safety in the 
industry. For example, we contribute to the Advancing Process 
Safety Initiative, a collaborative effort between the American 
Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the API. The goal 
of this initiative is to improve process safety performance 
across the industry, and nearly all of the refining capacity in 
the United States is represented in this initiative. The program 
creates more opportunities to communicate and share expe-
riences and knowledge about process safety events, hazard 
identification and performance metrics, and industry-proven 
practices. This effort recognizes that when a significant process 
safety event occurs at any site, large or small, it affects every-
one in the industry by eroding stakeholder trust.

Workplace Security

We are constantly assessing 
potential threats to our  
people, physical assets  
and intellectual property.

Security is deeply embedded into our day-to-day operations. 
We have developed consistent worldwide security practices 
and have appointed and trained site-security contacts to meet 
challenges in the diverse locations where we operate. Each 
new facility goes through a security analysis that takes into 
account potential risks, the application of countermeasures, 
relationships with communities and compliance with appli-
cable laws. Our security personnel regularly participate in 
governmental and industry forums to enhance our established 

risk-management methodologies, threat-assessment capa-
bilities and technical security applications. In higher-threat 
locations, we monitor local conditions and maintain detailed 
security preparedness plans.

As information technology continues to evolve, cyber- 
attacks present a greater risk to the safety and security of  
ExxonMobil’s data, facilities and ongoing business oper-
ations. On average, our cybersecurity screening programs 
block more than 80 million emails, 90 million Internet access 
attempts and 30,000 other potentially malicious actions each 
month. In addition, we have trained all of our employees and 
contractors on how to identify and respond to potential cyber-
security situations.

Emergency Preparedness  
and Response

An important aspect of our 
business is the ability to respond to 
emergencies as soon as they arise. 
ExxonMobil conducts extensive 
training and drills in preparation for 
such situations. 

Effective emergency preparedness depends on competent  
response teams. To develop and practice emergency response 
strategies and to relieve the burden on field responders, we 
establish strategic Emergency Support Groups (ESGs) consist-
ing of a wide range of ExxonMobil employees. We routinely 
train these groups on a range of possible scenarios, including 
simulated spills, fires, explosions, natural disasters and security 

Up Close: 
Regional Response Teams

ExxonMobil’s emergency preparedness and response model 
builds on a foundation of rapid and comprehensive response. 
Regardless of the size of an incident, each ExxonMobil facility 
and business unit has access to a wide array of trained respond-
ers, including, but not limited to, Regional Response Teams 
(RRTs). Our three RRTs — North America; Europe, Africa, Middle 
East; and Asia Pacific — comprise approximately 450 ExxonMobil 
personnel trained on one consistent system with common roles 
and responsibilities. They provide rapid response support, as well 
as professional support and assistance, when needed.

Emergency response requires a disciplined command and  
control approach based on clear communication. In total,  
the RRTs completed six training exercises in 2013, with 
approximately 350 ExxonMobil participants and more than 
200 external responders. 

As an example, our North America RRT conducted an exercise 
in San Francisco in 2013 in which more than 100 employees, 
along with approximately 150 regulatory agency members and 
contractors, participated. This exercise simulated a major spill 
of 148,000 barrels of Alaska North Slope crude off the coast 
of San Francisco. The major objectives of this training included 
validating and identifying areas for potential enhancement of 
response capability for hypothetical vessel spills offshore San 
Francisco, and building working relationships with key fed-
eral, state and local stakeholders. The exercise was successful 
in achieving its objectives, and we continue to share lessons 
learned with other RRT members. The North America RRT also 
responded to the Mayflower, Arkansas, incident in 2013. For 
more information, see page 33.

incidents. In 2013, an estimated 750 ExxonMobil employees 
participated in approximately 50 ESG training classes.  

Every site also conducts emergency drills in accordance with 
regulatory requirements and OIMS guidelines. Site response 
teams are supplemented with Emergency Response Strike 
Teams and RRTs, as needed. Both site and supplemental 
emergency response personnel train and exercise together on 
a regular basis. Our specialized three-day training program, 
which includes two days of classroom sessions and a day of 
outdoor hands-on training using oil spill response equipment, 
gives employees the skills they need to plan for and carry out 
a response using an Incident Command System structure. In 
2013, we held 15 training classes around the globe, and approx-
imately 250 ExxonMobil employees participated. 

Our training sessions in 2013 focused on recent advancements 
in emergency response, such as subsea injection of dispersants 
and enhanced shoreline cleanup assessments. We operate in  
some countries that do not have clear emergency response 
requirements, and in those cases, we apply global good prac-
tices to determine the frequency of emergency drills.

infectious disease control to monitor and address related 
issues. As part of this program, a multiyear plan was developed 
that focuses on implementing programs in locations with a 
significant threat of malaria and other vector-borne diseases, 
infectious outbreaks, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.

Our workplace HIV/AIDS program, StopAIDS, combines  
educational programs with access to community-based  
care and treatment for those affected by HIV. ExxonMobil  
does not test for HIV, nor is HIV status a factor in determining  
an employee’s ability to work. However, ExxonMobil  
encourages voluntary counseling and testing conducted  
by community providers.

The recently developed infectious disease outbreak man-
agement program for offshore sites and camps successfully 
reduced the spread of infections like norovirus to less than  
5 percent of workers in affected sites. The program is now 
being adopted as a best practice by others within the oil and 
gas industry.

Malaria is a significant concern at our operations in Africa and 
parts of Asia Pacific. Our Malaria Control Program covers  
both employees and contractors working in malaria-endemic 
countries. In 2013, 18 malaria cases were reported — compared 
with 203 in 2002 before the program matured — out of the 
thousands of our non-immune workers located in or visiting 
endemic areas. In the past 10 years, we estimate our work-
place Malaria Control Program has averted 1,800 malaria cases 
among non-immune workers. For more information about 
our efforts to eradicate malaria in the communities where we 
operate, see page 69.

PREVENTIVE CARE

INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL
We operate in a variety of countries throughout the world, and 
each location has its own health challenges. Some locations 
expose our workforce and their families to higher infectious 
disease risks. We have established a structured program for 

Investing in preventive health care is an effective way of 
reducing the incidence of chronic conditions, such as heart 
disease, diabetes, respiratory ailments, cancer and depression. 
ExxonMobil’s Culture of Health is our U.S. site-based pre-
ventive health and wellness program. This program includes 

resources for employees and family members to achieve 
personal health goals. In 2013, quarterly seminars focused on 
healthy food choices, fitness, stress management and quality 
sleep. A monthly awareness campaign highlighted employees 
who used the program tools and resources to make healthy 
lifestyle behavior changes.

Outside the United States, we are piloting culturally relevant 
programs within the context of different health care systems, 
health needs and available resources in the countries where 
we have offices and operations. The benefits plans we offer 
comply with or exceed applicable country laws or regulations, 
including requirements mandated by the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act in the United States.

activities and investments to create, develop and maintain 
a diverse workforce that represents the broad geographies 
where we do business. 

Our Global Diversity Framework is the foundation for our 
long-term, career-oriented approach to employment, with 
three interrelated objectives: attract, develop and retain a 
premier, diverse workforce; actively foster a productive work 
environment where individual and cultural differences are 
respected and valued; and identify and develop leadership 
capabilities to excel in a global environment. We use a series 
of Web-based trainings and tools to support this framework 
and help our employees understand effective cross-cultural 
communication and cultural sensitivities.

Our Standards of Business Conduct govern all aspects of our 
employment, including recruitment, hiring, work assignments, 
promotions, transfers, terminations, wage and salary admin-
istration, and selection for training. Our Standards support 
our commitment to equal employment opportunities, prohibit 
harassment and discrimination in the workplace, and align 
with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we 
operate. We strictly prohibit any form of discrimination by or 
toward employees, contractors, suppliers or customers in any 
ExxonMobil working environment.

    View our Standards of Business Conduct

Our global zero-tolerance policy applies to all forms of 
discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Harassment, even in its most 
subtle forms, directly conflicts with company policy and is not 
tolerated. Every employee is subject to disciplinary action, 
including termination, for any act of harassment. We employ a 
comprehensive education, training and stewardship program 
to ensure employees worldwide understand, implement and 
follow our antiharassment policy. We provide training on the 

Standards of Business Conduct for new employees and offer 
refresher courses to existing employees on a regular basis.
Our annual reporting and compliance procedures include a letter 
to senior managers emphasizing their responsibility to maintain 
work environments free from harassment and discrimination. 
Each affiliate has adopted ExxonMobil’s global standards, with 
modifications only as needed to comply with country laws. 

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

We support local employee networks around the world to 
foster a work environment dedicated to diversity and inclusion. 
These include the Asian Connection for Excellence (ACE); Black 
Employee Success Team (BEST); Global Organization for the 
Advancement of Latinos (GOAL); People for Respect, Inclusion 
and Diversity of Employees (PRIDE); and Women’s Interest Net-
work (WIN). These groups facilitate professional development 
programs, sponsor educational and community service programs 
to raise cultural awareness, and actively mentor new employees.

Regarding the importance of leveraging employee networks: 
“It speeds assimilation and builds confidence. Our company 
culture embraces diversity and encourages networking, 
which builds breadth, depth and relationships.” 

— Tony Lewis, Global Marketing and Growth Manager,  
    ExxonMobil Chemical, Houston, Texas 

Our comprehensive diversity and inclusion efforts also include 
educational partnerships and supplier diversity initiatives 
designed to improve the quality of life where we live and 
work. We support diversity-based education programs such 
as the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, National Society of Black 
Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, Society of Hispanic 
Professional Engineers and the National Action Council for 
Minorities in Engineering, among others. We believe these 
strategic investments in education will help build a global pool of 
talent in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics 
fields to support further development of the oil and gas  
industry. Without education today, we cannot advance

To increase the representation of minorities in our U.S. 
operations, our hiring programs include outreach to identify 
diverse candidates. For example, through our technical 
scholarship program, we award scholarships to ExxonMobil 
minority interns to assist them in completing their college 
degree. In 2013, we provided 76 technical scholarships, an 
increase of 90 percent from 2010. From a U.S. recruiting per-
spective, our minority representation among management 
and professional new hires was 29 percent in 2013. Further, 
32 percent of our newly hired engineers were minorities, 
significantly higher than the percentage of U.S. minorities in 
our broader population. Based on U.S. Equal Employment 

Opportunity Commission reporting, minorities made up 
approximately 24 percent of our U.S. workforce and about 
16 percent of officials and managers in 2013. Approximately 
12 percent of our U.S. executives in 2013 were minorities, an 
increase of 33 percent over the past decade.

RETENTION AND ENGAGEMENT

Our global, diverse workforce represents a source of com-
petitive advantage for ExxonMobil. We retain and develop 
our employees by fostering an environment where personal 
and professional growth is encouraged, and career objectives 
are developed and achieved. During the annual performance 
assessment and development process, every employee has 
a structured, documented discussion with their supervisors 
about work accomplishments, training objectives, develop-
ment opportunities and career interests. This process provides 
the basis for ongoing employee coaching and continuous 
performance improvement. The company’s training programs, 
mentorships and networking opportunities also help employ-
ees grow and develop throughout their time at ExxonMobil.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE WORKPLACE2013 Corporate Citizenship ReportPreventing and Mitigating 
Environmental Impacts  
in the Arctic

Orlan offshore platform. ExxonMobil scientists and engineers  
spent several years studying the ice environment offshore Russia’s 
Sakhalin Island.

The Arctic represents one of the world’s largest remaining 
regions of undiscovered conventional oil and gas resources, 
and we expect it to play a critical role in helping to meet the 
world’s growing energy demand. Arctic operations present 
unique technological, environmental and social challenges, 
and we know stakeholders are understandably interested in 
how the industry will address those challenges. 

Our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) is a foun-
dational framework to manage risks. We apply OIMS to identify 
the risks associated with projects and operating activities, and 
work to eliminate or reduce such risks, with the aim of prevent-
ing negative environmental and social impacts. It enables us to 
understand the unique physical, ecological, cultural and economic 

characteristics of project and operational locations. We then 
ensure the appropriate design capabilities and operating practices 
are in place to conduct our activities safely and sustainably. 

We have been conducting exploration and production oper-
ations in the Arctic for more than 90 years, and are among 
the industry leaders in oil spill prevention. Based on extensive 
industry experience, we know that incidents can be avoided 
and managed safely. This requires that wells are properly 
designed for the range of risks anticipated, established 
procedures are followed, layers of redundancy are built in, 
equipment is properly inspected and maintained, operators are 
trained, tests and drills are conducted, and the focus remains 
on safe operations and risk management.

The Arctic is a complex and diverse environment. As we do with 
all of our projects, ExxonMobil prioritizes our activities based on 
a number of factors, such as safety, environmental and social. We 
typically extend the planning and development phase of the more 
challenging areas as we progress technologies to enable safe and 
environmentally sound activities. We take a careful approach to 
each project to ensure we have the capability to manage opera-
tional and environmental risks safely before we proceed. Some of 
the ways we do this are described in this case study.

In the unlikely and unfortunate event of a spill, ExxonMobil 
has the technical expertise, experienced personnel, quali-
fied responders, access to response equipment and financial 
resources that enable us — while working closely with local

PREDRILLING STUDIES AND SURVEYS

We conduct extensive studies and surveys before we com-
mence drilling operations in every location, including in the 
Arctic. We know a scientific understanding of the local environ-
mental surroundings is critical to preventing an incident. 

First, we undertake a thorough analysis of the literature and  
technical data available. Second, we conduct a comprehensive 
field survey designed specifically for the area of interest.  
Typically, we map several square kilometers in the targeted drill-
ing location to identify potential hazards and sensitive environ-
ments. We use tools such as a multibeam echo sounder, which 
provides a highly detailed, three-dimensional underwater  
map of the seabed, to identify larger obstructions such as  
rock outcrops and sunken vessels, or a sub-bottom profiler, 
which provides high-resolution views of what is buried below 
the seabed, such as pipelines and telecommunications cables. 
We also procure and analyze satellite imagery and other  
remote sensing data to inform our planning and decision- 
making processes.

The data collected in the field surveys include precise GPS 
location information, allowing us to compile detailed maps 
of the identified hazards in the immediate area. We then use 
these maps to plan activities associated with drilling a well. As 
another precaution, we typically employ a remotely operated 

ICE MONITORING, MANAGEMENT AND STRUCTURAL 
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Each area of the Arctic has its own unique ice environment. 
In order to prevent spills and other potential environmental 
impacts, we must understand each setting so we can  
design suitable operations and facilities that can safely  
operate under the most extreme conditions. 

For example, beginning nearly a decade before first oil pro-
duction, ExxonMobil scientists and engineers, in partnership 
with Russian research institutes, studied the ice environment 
offshore Russia’s Sakhalin Island. We studied satellite images 
of ice formation and movement, installed seafloor-mounted  
ice drift and thickness monitoring stations, conducted  
on-ice drilling and strength testing of ice features, and  
completed seafloor ice gouge surveys. 

We conducted similar studies in advance of planned explora-
tion drilling programs in Russia’s Kara Sea. With our partner 
Rosneft, we have conducted several ice characterization 
expeditions aboard icebreaking vessels with the aid of the 
Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute. The aim of 
these expeditions was to gain a better understanding of the 
local marine environment. We used satellite imagery and 
vessel observations to locate, count and measure the size  
of sea ice flows and icebergs in the area, and we deployed 
GPS tracking buoys to track drift patterns. We analyzed 
decades of ice coverage data and satellite images to  
understand the range of conditions that could be encoun-
tered. In 2013, during the time of year ExxonMobil expects  
to undertake drilling and construction activities in the future,  
we conducted field testing of our planned Kara Sea ice 
reconnaissance program using daily satellite images,  
on-site testing of advanced marine radar systems and  
testing of fixed-wing ice surveys to identify and track  
drifting ice within 100 kilometers of our proposed drill site.

demonstrated that our actions have resulted in no significant 
impact to the whales or their habitat in our operating area. 
Their population continues to increase, and whales that utilize 
the habitat offshore Sakhalin Island commingle with the larger 
population of eastern gray whales in North American waters. 

As part of our effort to avoid or reduce risks to marine life, we 
assess the potential effects of sound generated by our offshore 
activities during seismic surveys. Three decades of world-
wide seismic surveying activity and scientific research have 
demonstrated that such surveys can be conducted safely and 
without any adverse effects on marine mammal populations. 
Further, we have implemented mitigation measures to reduce 
the potential effects on marine mammals. We set ship traffic 
guidance and establish marine mammal exclusion zones with 
calibrated buffer distances. We have specially trained observ-
ers onboard survey vessels to detect marine mammals within a 
defined safety zone, and we use hydrophones to detect vocal-
izing marine mammals. If we detect mammals within the safety 
zone, we immediately halt a survey until the area is clear. We 
also use a slow ramp-up procedure when starting or restarting 
a seismic survey that gradually increases sound level, allowing 
animals to leave the area if they react to sound. 

We are also working to improve our understanding of the com-
plex characteristics of sounds in the marine environment, how 
they propagate, how marine life uses sound and what sound 
levels and frequencies different forms of marine life receive. In 
2004, ExxonMobil and several other energy companies formed 
the Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry Program, which funds 
research on the effects of sound on marine life. To date, the 
program has invested $35 million on 70 research projects con-
ducted by scientists in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, the 
United Kingdom and the United States. These projects include 
understanding the magnitude and frequencies of sounds from 
engineered sound sources, and how seismic surveys affect 
whale and seal behaviors and the hearing capabilities of logger-
head turtles. To learn more about the Joint Industry Program, 
visit soundandmarinelife.org.

In addition to our focus on spill prevention, we work to gain  
a better understanding of the Arctic ecosystem so we can 
identify how, when and where our activities might interact  
with marine life.

We have assisted an international group of Arctic marine 
biologists and oceanographers — led by Dr. Arne Bjørge at the 
Norwegian Marine Research Institute in Bergen — to improve 
understanding of habitats and foraging traits for five seal species 
across Northeast Greenland, Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya. As a 
result, we are better able to map ecosystem parameters through

UPSTREAM ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIOECONOMIC AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Globally, our projects and operations 
are set in a diverse range of 
environments that carry different 
sets of environmental, social and 
health risks, which we carefully 
identify, assess, manage and monitor 
throughout their life cycle. 

Wherever we operate, we employ structured environmental manage-
ment processes across a project’s life cycle to ensure we are effectively 
addressing environmental, social and health risks. Our corporate Envi-

and economic needs of the communities in which we do business.  
Our approach to environmental protection begins with a thorough 
understanding of local environmental, socioeconomic and health sur-
roundings. This understanding is critical to superior performance.

We identify potential risks through the Environmental Aspects 
Assessment and Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact 
Assessment (ESHIA) processes. For more information about our ESHIA 
process, see page 60. We also prepare Environmental, Socioeconomic

Innovation in Oil  
Sands Technology

Canada’s oil sands are a key global resource and are critical to 
North America’s energy security. We believe technology and  
innovation provide solutions for managing the environmental 
impacts associated with oil sands development. Imperial, an  
ExxonMobil affiliate, has dedicated facilities, scientists and 
engineers that work closely with ExxonMobil’s research teams 
to focus on game-changing oil sands innovations that could 
improve environmental performance, such as reducing GHG 
emissions and water use and improving the management of 
tailings. Imperial is investing more than $100 million per year in 
research and is participating in multiple industry collaborations. 

    Watch one of our employees talk about our  
    Kearl oil sands operation

One technology that holds promise to improve environmental 
performance related to oil sands processing is tailings dewatering. 
Tailings, which are a byproduct of oil sands mining, consist of a 
mixture of water, clay, sand and residual bitumen; they have been a 
focus of concern due to their growing footprint. Imperial’s research 
team is developing a technology to bind the clay and sand together 
with solid particles, allowing them to separate from the water. 
Compared with liquid tailings, these separated particles provide a 
solid surface that can accelerate reclamation, while the separated

Extended reach drilling allows for the directional drilling of very 
long horizontal wells. By using this technology, we can access 
oil and gas resources in complex and challenging environ-
ments, such as the Arctic, and reduce potential environmental 
impacts by limiting or eliminating our interaction with the 
marine environment. For example, at the Sakhalin-1 project 
in Russia, operated by ExxonMobil subsidiary Exxon Neftegas 
Limited (ENL), wells are drilled from a location on land to 
access the oil and gas reservoirs under the seafloor. ENL has 
drilled nine of the world’s 10 longest-reach horizontal wells, 
and holds the current world record with a well that extends 
12,700 meters — more than 7.5 miles.

Biodiversity and  
Ecosystem Services

Our approach to protecting 
biodiversity and ecosystem services 
recognizes factors such as the 
rarity of individual species, their 
roles in different ecosystems and 
habitats, their vulnerability and 
their cultural significance. 

Ecosystem services are the direct and indirect economic ben-
efits people obtain from the environment, such as food, water, 
shelter, clean air and cultural identity. Safeguarding the ability 
of the environment to provide such benefits is an important 
focus area for ExxonMobil. 

including oil and gas, wind energy, fishing and recreation. The 
results from this workshop indicated food, raw materials and 
recreation rank highest on the list of valued ecosystem ser-
vices in the Gulf region. By assessing how ecosystem services 
and biodiversity can be impacted by different development 
strategies, we can incorporate sustainability considerations 
into our development plans.

In Papua New Guinea, our biodiversity offset program is pro-
gressing. The five components of the program include:

•  Component 1 — Work at the regional level to support 

the Papua New Guinea Department of Environment and 
Conservation (DEC) in the development of a protected area 
system for the Kikori River Basin

•  Component 2 — Work at the national level to support the 

DEC in furthering its objectives under the National Biodiver-
sity Strategy and Action Plan

•  Component 3 — Enhance conservation capacity, which 

involves technical capacity-building related to conservation 
through the University of Papua New Guinea in a program 
to be led by the Mama Graun Conservation Trust Fund

ExxonMobil is also proud to support innovative research for 
improved biodiversity management. In 2013, we contributed 
approximately $4 million to organizations focused on biodiver-
sity protection and land conservation. We have partnered with 
the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario at the University of Guelph 
for the past three years on DNA-based technologies for 
biodiversity management. Advances in the technology used 
for DNA sequencing and the development of global databases 
that store sequencing information have made it possible to 
assess and monitor species by analyzing the DNA left behind 
by various organisms in water and soil. This DNA analysis 
technique allows scientists to better understand biodiversity 
in any region of the world. We piloted this technology in the 
Canadian Beaufort Sea to test whether various samples can 
provide sufficient data to assist in determining the presence 
of species and habitat use, as well as in identifying rare or 
endemic species. We have also done work in Qatar to evaluate 
the use of DNA-based technology to determine the health of 
coral and sea grass. We plan to expand our research to other 
areas to test this approach in habitats ranging from tropical 
areas to temperate and arid environments.

PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY

•  Component 4 — Enhance and strengthen one or more 

We are continuously looking for new tools and analytical 
methods to better understand local biodiversity conditions 
and ecosystem services in support of our management 
strategies. For example, ExxonMobil researchers developed 
a new framework for characterizing marine environmental 
sensitivities by prioritizing ecosystem services within regions 
of interest. During 2012, we piloted this framework in an 
analysis involving the Gulf of Mexico. In 2013, with the help 
of academic partners from the Harte Institute of Gulf of 
Mexico Studies, we expanded on this work by incorporating 
stakeholder input into the prioritization process. We held a 
stakeholder workshop in Houston, Texas, that included par-
ticipants from the federal government and several industries, 

existing protected areas in the Kikori River Basin 

WORKING IN PROTECTED AREAS

•  Component 5 — Establish one or more new community- 

based protected areas in the Kikori River Basin

In April 2013, we advanced Component 3 above, based on 
an agreement with the Mama Graun Conservation Trust 
Fund, to establish a conservation management course, award 
scholarships for participation in the course and provide work 
placements for graduates. In September, the University of 
Papua New Guinea announced it would offer a Diploma in 
Conservation Management as part of this initiative.

We periodically screen our major operating facilities against 
databases of the International Union for Conservation of 
Nature (IUCN) and World Protected Areas. We confirmed an 
estimated 21 percent of our 89 major facilities are within five 
kilometers of designated environmentally protected areas. 
We ensure adequate plans are in place at our sites to mitigate 
elevated biodiversity or species risks. 

By the end of 2013, we actively managed more than 7,000 acres 
of land for the benefit of wildlife at 21 of our sites, including 
assessing the wildlife and habitat, developing a plan to enhance 
or sustain them, implementing the plan and monitoring the

life Habitat Council for the development of educational and 
outreach programs at our sites through the Corporate Lands for 
Learning (CLL) program. Currently, we have five programs with 
CLL status; this helps us promote environmental awareness, 
biodiversity and science initiatives.

In 2010, we initiated a substantial multiyear, cooperative wildlife 
research program in conjunction with Colorado State Univer-
sity and Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The research program is 
designed to identify ways for industry to reduce its environmen-
tal impacts and improve the compatibility of resource extraction 
activities with wildlife. XTO Energy has provided $5 million to 
assess and enhance habitats for large animals and sage grouse 
in the Piceance Basin in Colorado.

Wastewater Management

We are committed to finding ways 
to reduce the quantity and improve 
the quality of the wastewater 
managed in our operations.

Oil and gas production and refining and chemicals manufac-
turing operations typically produce wastewater that requires 
treatment before its reuse, discharge or disposal. Treatment 
methodologies range from the removal of hydrocarbons and 
suspended solids from produced water, to multistage biological 
systems for treating refinery, chemical plant and other Upstream 
wastewaters. We seek innovative solutions for addressing 
wastewater issues throughout our operations. For example, in 
Colorado, XTO Energy’s coal-bed methane operations in the 
Raton Basin produce an average of 1.5 million gallons of water 
per day. This produced water, which is a naturally occurring

Marine Environment  
Research in Qatar

The Environmental Management Research Program at  
ExxonMobil Research Qatar (EMRQ) targets a better under-
standing of the marine environment in Qatar. A key component 
of the work underway is environmental risk studies involving 
marine life, including photosynthetic organisms such as algae. 

Working in collaboration with Qatar University’s Environmen-
tal Studies Center, EMRQ has isolated and grown single- 
species algae cultures that will be used to develop methods for 
determining the biological effects of compounds discharged 
to the Qatar marine environment from industrial processes. 
These studies will incorporate cutting-edge technologies such 
as delayed fluorescence from high-sensitivity luminometers. 
This work will complement other studies undertaken at EMRQ 
using species higher in the food chain. When completed, a 
comprehensive set of methods spanning the major levels of 
the food chain will provide a valuable scientific tool for envi-
ronmental risk screening for Qatar and the Arabian Gulf. 

Concurrently, EMRQ is working with the Qatar Ministry of 
Environment and Hamad Hospital on a related study to map 
the microbial diversity in the Qatar marine zone. This infor-
mation will be integrated with other environmental data in a 
geographic mapping framework, which EMRQ and others 
can use to address questions related to microbial diversity 
and correlate changes with varying environmental effects of 
human activities. 

The Environmental Management Research Program at ExxonMobil 
Research Qatar is conducting environmental risk studies involving 
marine life such as algae.

“Research conducted by ExxonMobil Research Qatar is 
undertaken to provide a sound scientific basis for environ-
mental risk assessment, which is key to the development 
and implementation of effective environmental manage-
ment strategies for Qatar. This type of industry-government 
research collaboration undertaken on the local environment 
allows for knowledge transfer and scientific enrichment for 
all involved.”

Spill Performance

1XTO Energy performance included beginning in 2011.

We are focused on implementing 
preventive measures to avoid spill 
incidents and ensuring a rapid 
response if spills do occur. We had 
about 7 percent fewer spills in 
2013 compared with 2012.

We continually seek to develop and improve risk management, 
operations integrity, spill prevention processes and containment 
capabilities. The total volume of hydrocarbons spilled to soil and 
water was 11,000 barrels in 2013; more than 60 percent was 
recovered at the spill sites. The number of hydrocarbon spills 
greater than 1 barrel in 2013 was 7 percent lower than in 2012.

Every day, we transport approximately 2.7 million barrels of 
petroleum and chemical products through approximately 
8,000 miles of pipelines throughout the world. We maintain 
and test our pipelines regularly to ensure their integrity and 
detect corrosion and other concerns. We patrol pipeline routes 
on the ground and in the air, and we closely monitor pipeline 

operations around the clock using state-of-the-art systems, 
alarms and other technologies. 

On March 29, 2013, we had a crude oil spill in Mayflower, 
Arkansas — a regrettable incident for which we are deeply 
sorry. We responded immediately, with a focus on community 
safety and restoring the environment. More than 700 people 
assisted with the response and cleanup during the first week 
following the incident, and we are grateful for the support 
from local officials and the community during the response. 
We continue to work with the Arkansas Department of Envi-
ronmental Quality to complete remediation activities, and we 
are committed to remaining in Mayflower until the job is done. 
We are taking the necessary measures to ensure a similar 
incident does not happen again.

The worldwide marine business of ExxonMobil’s affiliates, 
which involves about 650 vessels in daily service, logged 
more than 20,000 voyages and 45,000 port calls in 2013, 
safely transporting about 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil and 
refined products. We experienced the first release of hydro-
carbons to water of any kind from our marine affiliate-operated 
vessels in more than seven years, when 1 cup of hydraulic 

oil escaped onboard containment. A third-party vessel on 
long-term charter also had a cargo spill of about 1 quart 
of lubricant oil. Our marine affiliates continue to conduct 
in-depth investigations and implement measures designed 
to eliminate spills and incidents.

OFFSHORE OIL SPILL RESPONSE

In order to maintain a high level of operational performance 
everywhere we work, we establish specialized spill response 
capabilities and tactics. We have a dedicated, in-house Arctic oil 
spill response research program, and we have led several joint- 
industry projects to enhance spill response efforts in ice-bearing 
waters. We have also commercialized the use of biodegrad-
able surfactants that can be sprayed onto the water surface 
around the perimeter of an oil slick, causing the oil to retract and 
rethicken so that it can be burned in a controlled fashion without 
using a fire-resistant boom. This technology may be particularly 
useful in remote Arctic locations. We are also studying the use 
of fast-moving, small helicopters to deliver the surfactants to the 
site of a spill; we think this technology can also expand the use of 
in situ burning in non-Arctic open-water conditions.

    Preparedness and Response publication

Since 2010, we have collaborated with others in our industry 
to develop an oil spill containment system for the Gulf of Mex-
ico through our membership in the Marine Well Containment 
Company (MWCC). In 2013, MWCC enhanced the contain-
ment system by expanding its capacity to handle fluids up to 
350 degrees Fahrenheit and pressures up to 15,000 pounds 
per square inch, making it the only system in the world with 
such a capability. These enhancements allow us to drill wells 
safely at greater depths, pressures and temperatures, which 
contributes to continued safe operations offshore in the Gulf.

Waste Management

Our first priority is to avoid waste 
generation, and then to reuse 
or recycle waste wherever and 
whenever safely possible. 

Waste management presents challenges in some of our more 
remote operating locations, such as in Papua New Guinea. 
Accordingly, we have developed innovative approaches for  
handling some of the waste streams produced during con-
struction of our Papua New Guinea Liquefied Natural Gas 
Project’s facilities. For example, to divert used tires away from 
landfills, we pursued EcoFlex technology. This methodology 
allows tires to be used in civil and environmental engineering 
applications, including the construction of containment and 
diversionary structures, road and paving systems, and soil  
stabilization and erosion control devices. The Papua New 
Guinea Department of Environment and Conservation has 
shown interest in EcoFlex for potential use in other parts  
of the country. 

Biological digesters have also been used at one of the project’s 
construction camps to manage food wastes, and these devices 
have proven to be efficient in handling this particular waste 
stream. The product is combined with topsoil and used during 
land reinstatement.

Our Fuels & Lubricants business continues to pursue its “zero 
net waste” program. We focused initially on a few ExxonMobil  
lubricant locations to identify beneficial reduction and dispo-
sition practices for various types of wastes. Subsequently, we 
benchmarked against waste management companies and 
facilities in other industries to identify best practices and pro-
cesses that we could broadly integrate into Fuels & Lubricants 
site programs around the globe. We plan to begin a formal 
rollout of this program in 2014.

We take a comprehensive approach to managing waste 
effectively in our drilling operations. At each drilling site, we

determine optimal, cost-effective methods that are protective 
of the environment and are in compliance with regulatory 
requirements and internationally recognized industry practices.

In 2013, we safely disposed of 280,000 metric tons of hazard-
ous waste from our ongoing operations. In total, we reused or 
recycled about one-third of the hazardous waste generated 
by our operations. In 2013, our property remediation activities 
generated approximately 75 percent of our hazardous waste, 
which we safely disposed of in compliance with applicable 
regulatory requirements.

Environmental Compliance

We comply with all applicable 
environmental laws and 
regulations, and apply responsible 
standards where laws and 
regulations do not exist.

Our worldwide environmental expenditures in 2013 totaled 
approximately $6 billion. This included an estimated $2.5 billion 
in capital expenditures and approximately $3.5 billion in operating 
expenses. In 2013, 74 penalties, fines and settlements were paid 
— compared with 80 in 2012 — accounting for less than 1 percent 
of total environmental expenditures, or about $2 million.

ExxonMobil commenced the startup of a new diesel hydrotreater 
at the Singapore refinery in 2013. This brings ExxonMobil’s 
investments in ultralow-sulfur diesel facilities around the world 
to more than $3 billion. In addition to the new unit in Singapore, 
ExxonMobil has constructed diesel hydrotreaters at its refineries 
in Baytown and Baton Rouge in the United States, Antwerp in 
Belgium, Sriracha in Thailand and Yanbu in Saudi Arabia. When 
used in modern engines in tractor trailers, buses, marine vessels, 
locomotives and heavy construction equipment, ultralow-sulfur 
diesel can greatly reduce emissions and improve air quality.

Restoring the Environment

Efficiently remediating and 
restoring the lands we affect is 
central to reducing our overall  
environmental impact. 

Over the past six years, we have actively enhanced our approach 
to the remediation of affected properties and the transfer of 
non-operating surplus properties to beneficial end use. Since 
2008, ExxonMobil Environmental Services (EMES) has spent 
more than $4 billion in remediation activities and returned more 
than 1,000 properties to beneficial end use.2 In 2013, EMES 
monitored more than 6,500 active projects in our global portfolio, 
compared with more than 8,000 projects in 2012.

Our focus on site reclamation continues to lead us toward 
innovative ways to remediate and to enhance the pace of  
disposition of surplus properties to enable their beneficial 
end use. In 2013, ExxonMobil completed the donation of an 
approximately 13-acre site to Blacksburg, South Carolina. 

The town will work with a local land trust, Upstate Forever, 
to develop the property for recreational use. In Baltimore, 
Maryland, on a site that was once part of a refinery and prod-
ucts terminal, a developer has completed construction of a 
new urban shopping center that includes a small park, which 
will serve as a much-needed resource for nearby neighbors. 
A 58-acre property in Olean, New York — a former refinery that 
operated from 1872 to 1955 — was sold to a developer that will 
proceed with redevelopment and the required cleanup under 
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation 
Brownfields Cleanup Program (BCP). While the criteria and 
requirements of the BCP are rigorous, it provides incentives 
intended to enhance private-sector cleanup and redevelopment 
of brownfield sites, including tax credits for developers, a tax 
credit for real estate property taxes and an environmental reme-
diation insurance credit. These incentives help bring needed 
economic development to communities. 

The process of remediating a property, determining a bene-
ficial end use and ultimately transferring the property out of 
the EMES portfolio can be challenging and time-consuming. 

A new urban shopping center on a site that was once part of a 
refinery and products terminal in Baltimore, Maryland.

Additionally, there are a variety of complex regulatory require-
ments that come into play during the process. To overcome 
some of these challenges, ExxonMobil collaborates with a 
wide variety of stakeholders, including local, state and federal 
regulators and, in some cases, the new property owners. Real-
izing other companies across a variety of industries face similar 
challenges, ExxonMobil is leveraging its depth of experience 
in remediation and creative end use to help establish a Surplus 
Property Roundtable (SPR). The SPR is a forum for more than  
15 companies to share best practices and ideas for beneficial 
and innovative end uses of surplus properties. In addition, 
our partnership with the Land Trust Alliance and collabora-
tions with land trusts across the United States continue as we 
endeavor to advance land conservation as an end-use option 
for future properties. 

2 The total number of surplus properties in the portfolio changes as we transfer 
properties out and as new properties come into the portfolio. In 2013, we had 
almost 3,000 properties, 100 less than in 2012, in the surplus-site portfolio. 
We expect the 2014 number of surplus properties to decrease by an additional 
150 properties, demonstrating we are effectively implementing our land 
management strategies.

Groundwater Research

Among the challenges we face is determining the most effective 
remediation approach for a property, which can be a technically 
complicated and lengthy process. No two sites are the same — 
each has a unique geological, ecological and regulatory setting. 
Only through science-based investigations can the current 
condition of the soil and groundwater at a site be determined 
and the most effective approach to remediation be identified. In 
addition, science-based technological advancements take time 
to identify, test and verify. ExxonMobil works with a number of 
academic institutions and organizations to help develop and 
advance scientific approaches that underpin soil and ground-
water remediation technology, as well as identify and develop 
new, effective approaches for land reclamation.

For example, through our involvement with the University Con-
sortium for Field-Focused Groundwater Research, we devel-
oped a more complete understanding and quantification of a 
managed approach to natural attenuation — the breakup and 
digestion of contamination by microorganisms — called Natural 
Source Zone Depletion (NSZD). Recent pilot tests monitoring 
this phenomenon in Bayonne, New Jersey, indicated the rate of 
natural depletion may be at least 10 times faster than existing 
conventional physical oil recovery rates at this site. This knowl-
edge will help craft a more sustainable long-term remediation 
approach for this and other properties. Based on the results 
of the pilot tests, NSZD studies are underway at several sites 
around the United States, and we plan to test this application at 
remediation sites around the world.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE2013 Corporate Citizenship ReportResponsible Water 
Management

The global population is estimated to increase by nearly 2 bil-
lion people between now and 2040. This population increase, 
coupled with growing economic prosperity, will increase 
demand for natural resources, including water. When taken 
in total, the volume of freshwater on the planet is enough to 
support the world’s population; however, water is not always 
available where and when it is needed. Its availability is subject 
to seasonal and annual variability, and may be restricted by 
poor infrastructure or socioeconomic factors in a given region.

The industrial sector, including the oil and gas industry, 
accounts for 5 to 10 percent of total water withdrawals in 
even the highest-income countries — far less than the water 
needs for agriculture or electric power generation, for example.1 

However, the oil and gas industry can be a material user of 
water at local levels. We recognize that stakeholders have 
concerns about the use and protection of this resource. As 
such, we focus our efforts on preventing adverse impacts to 
water resources and prudently managing the water we do use. 
As part of our comprehensive risk management approach, we 
are committed to managing the interaction of our activities 
with water. We aim to protect human health and the environ-
ment, consider local water availability and needs, continuously 
improve our capabilities and performance regarding our use 
of water, and engage stakeholders in the development of 
sustainable solutions.

PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT
We are committed to protecting human health and the envi-
ronment by preventing spills and leaks and limiting the impacts 
of our water withdrawals, consumption and discharges. In 
2013, net freshwater consumption at our operations was 280 
million cubic meters. This represents a 24 percent decrease 
compared with 2011. 

Designing to improve water quality — Our environmental  
practices and standards ensure that risk management  
measures are incorporated into the design and operation  
of our facilities. For example, we have begun constructing an 

advanced biological wastewater treatment facility at our  
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery that will reduce total  
nitrate discharges by 500 tons per year. While the refinery  
is a relatively small contributor to overall nitrate discharges  
into the Mississippi River basin, this voluntary reduction will 
have direct environmental benefits for the Gulf of Mexico, 
where high levels of nitrates over several years have created 
a dead zone, or an area of low dissolved oxygen. The refinery 
received awards from the Louisiana governor and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency in recognition of these 
voluntary efforts.

Spill prevention — We employ a rigorous approach to prevent 
spills and leaks in our operations. To learn more about our 
focus on spill prevention and response, see page 33. 

CONSIDERING LOCAL WATER NEEDS
We consider local water needs and alternatives when sourcing 
water for our activities, including identifying and managing 
risks related to water availability and quality. We have been 
active in collaborative industry initiatives to develop a suite of 
standard tools for systematic water resource management. The 
IPIECA Global Water Tool for Oil and Gas is a version of the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 
Global Water Tool that has been customized for the oil and gas 
sector. The IPIECA tool helps companies map water use and 
assess risks. ExxonMobil performs a screening exercise each 
year using this tool after the WBCSD updates its Global Water 
Tool with new data. Of our 89 major operating sites, approx-
imately one-quarter are located in areas identified with the 
potential for water stress or scarcity. These areas are located in  
13 countries.

We develop and implement local water management pro-
grams in locations where we identify potential water-related 
risks. In some cases, this entails a review of freshwater con-
sumption rates to identify improvement opportunities. A more 
focused water tool is sometimes used to identify and rank risks 
associated with the availability and reliability of local water 
sources and wastewater discharge locations. ExxonMobil 
worked with IPIECA and the Global Environmental Manage-
ment Initiative to develop such a tool for the oil and gas  
industry to complement the IPIECA Global Water Tool.

Replace, reduce, reuse and recycle — Our operations use 
alternative water sources, where appropriate, and seek 
opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle water. We consider 
multiple factors in determining the right approach for a given 
process or site. We assess actual costs, as well as potential

trated waste streams. Together, these factors help us deter-
mine an implicit value of water, which varies from site to site 
due to local conditions and availability. 

Our Torrance, California, refinery purchases and uses recycled 
wastewater from a local municipal treatment plant for cooling 
tower makeup and boiler feed water, representing nearly  
70 percent of the facility’s water consumption. Water is also 
a key consideration in our oil sands developments in Alberta, 
Canada. We designed the Kearl oil sands operation to run 
on stored water during the low-flow winter months in order 
to reduce withdrawals from the Athabasca River during this 
period. In our heavy oil operations at Cold Lake, Canada, we 
employ a variety of water-use reduction measures, and about 
90 percent of water used on-site is non-potable water that 
comes to the surface along with bitumen during production.

CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING CAPABILITIES  
AND PERFORMANCE 
We use research and operational analyses to support the con-
tinuous improvement of water-related technologies, practices 
and performance. Our researchers have published life cycle 
assessments in peer-reviewed journals on topics such as algae 
biofuel technology options and shale gas production, including 
their impacts on water. We conduct cutting-edge research and 
development through in-house efforts and partnerships with 
other industries, and by funding academic and other non- 
governmental research projects. Some of these investiga-
tions deal with water-related challenges and opportunities. 
For example, Imperial, along with 11 other major operators, 
created the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) in 
2012. Currently, 13 companies, including Imperial, participate 
in COSIA. It was created to develop and share technologies 
that improve environmental performance in the Canadian oil 
sands sector. Water is one of the priority areas for COSIA. 

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT  
OF SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS

We collaborate with stakeholders to promote the long-term 
viability of source waters, watersheds and related ecosys-
tems in areas where we work. For example, in October 2012, 
Qatar University and ExxonMobil entered into a partnership to 
research industrial wastewater reuse technologies. In particular, 
researchers are studying phytoremediation, a process that uses 
select native plants to clean water in an engineered wetlands 
system. Treated wastewater can then be reused in non-potable 
applications, such as park or green-space irrigation.

Community water projects — In some communities where  
we operate, safe drinking water is not available on a consistent 
basis. As part of our approach to starting new operations,  
we consider opportunities that bring benefits to the local  
community and our business, including potentially investing  
in community water projects. For example, ExxonMobil’s  
affiliate in Indonesia, Mobil Cepu Limited (MCL), launched  
a community-based water program to reduce the incidence  
of waterborne diseases and promote healthier living in  
the Cepu Block area of Indonesia.

Water testing at our Longford facility in Australia. We consider local 
water needs and alternatives when sourcing water for our activities, 
including identifying and managing risks related to water availability 
and quality.

Oil and Gas 
Development

ExxonMobil and our subsidiary XTO Energy have been 
involved in unconventional oil and gas development for many 
years. Our approach begins with successful stakeholder 
engagement and continued diligence managing environmen-
tal, social and health risks and performance. 

    Watch our unconventional resources timeline video

Natural gas is an abundant, reliable and versatile fuel source.  
In the United States, vast new supplies of natural gas are 
providing strong economic benefits and helping the nation 
meet shared environmental priorities. The U.S. Energy Infor-
mation Administration estimated that in 2012, energy-related 
U.S. CO2 emissions fell by 3.8 percent to levels not seen since 
1994. A key reason for this is the increased use of natural gas, 
as it emits up to 60 percent less CO2 than coal when used 
for power generation. ExxonMobil continues to invest in this 
important resource. 

Karen Matusic,  
Public and Government 
Affairs Manager for XTO 
Energy in the Appalachia 
Division

How does XTO Energy identify and engage with stakehold-
ers in the Appalachia region? 
Karen: We think open and active dialogue with community 
members is vital to our long-term operations in the region. 
Before we enter a specific township or county, we do extensive 
research on who lives and works in the area and we identify 
key community leaders — local officials, leaders in education,

business community members, emergency and first responders, 
land and mineral rights owners, and local charitable organiza-
tions. We meet with representatives from each of these groups 
to find out what is important to the community, and to listen to 
their questions and concerns.

How important is stakeholder engagement to XTO Energy’s 
operations in the Appalachia region of the United States? 
Karen: It goes to the heart of what we do. XTO Energy wants 
to be a welcomed member of the community and a partner of 
choice. Headlines in major newspapers do not always capture 
what is important to local community members in the places 
where we work.

There is no substitute for actually sitting down and talking to the 
community. Though the Appalachian states have a long history 
of energy production, shale development is new. It is important 
that we explain to community members what they can expect 
when we begin operations, and keep them informed regularly.

the community and the environment.

Paul Krishna, 
Environmental, Health 
and Safety Issue Manager 
for XTO Energy

A worker from ExxonMobil’s subsidiary XTO Energy. In the past  
60 years, oil and gas producers have employed hydraulic fracturing  
to access more than 1 million wells safely and effectively. 

XTO Energy employees hold an open house with community mem-
bers in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

To that end, we prepare regular activity reports in select areas, 
which we send via email to key stakeholders.

It is also important that we hear their concerns, not just at the 
beginning of the project but throughout the entire life cycle. We 
have undertaken several approaches in our division to establish 
a two-way dialogue with our stakeholders. In some situations, 
we create a community advisory panel in select areas to estab-
lish regular face-to-face meetings between a cross-section of 
the community and XTO Energy employees. We also participate 
in meetings with local officials, as needed, and provide site tours 
to community members so they can observe and ask ques-
tions about drilling, hydraulic fracturing and processing. XTO 
Energy workers in our divisions address local organizations and 
participate in school events. We also support workforce training 
initiatives to enable local residents to find employment support-
ing our industry.

What are the biggest challenges you face when trying to 
address community concerns? 
Karen: Naturally, people living near our operations are 
concerned our work will disrupt their way of life. That is why 
it remains important for us to understand the setting and 
issues, and then implement practices from the onset that will 
minimize potential impacts, such as altering our traffic routes 
to avoid disrupting school bus traffic. Our industry can provide 
significant benefits for local communities and provide them 
with the means to preserve their way of life. For example, we 
sign leases with a number of farmers, and the money they 
receive from signing bonuses and royalties enables them to 
build new barns or buy new farming equipment.

The biggest challenge we face from a public affairs standpoint 
is combating the misinformation about our industry and its 
operations. This is why it is crucial that XTO Energy and other 

Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the poten-
tial environmental and community impacts associated with 
unconventional oil and gas development. What is XTO Energy 
doing to manage those potential impacts?
Paul: All energy resources have potential impacts. Unconven-
tional oil and gas development is no different. ExxonMobil 
has been rigorously evaluating the proven scientific risks and 
mitigations for hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, water 
usage, groundwater protection, community health, seismicity 
and chemical use, to name a few.  

I lead the Unconventional Resources Development Issue  
Management Team (URD IMT), which is responsible for assess-
ing these issues and for positioning the company ahead of the 
ever-changing landscape of concerns and challenges regarding 
unconventional resource development. The team consists of  
60 ExxonMobil employees, including managers; researchers;  
engineers and scientists; environmental, health and safety pro-
fessionals; lawyers; and public and government affairs experts.  

Unconventional resource development has attracted attention 
from a wide range of interested parties, including investors,  

exxonmobil.com

41

2013 Corporate Citizenship ReportCase StudyUNCONVENTIONAL OIL 
AND GAS DEVELOPMENT

governments, regulators, opinion-makers, think tanks, academ-
ics, media and NGOs. Our team engages with these groups 
to ensure that ExxonMobil, as a responsible operator and 
credible partner, is able to develop resources in the United 
States and abroad. The IMT’s work spans legislative activi-
ties, regulatory advocacy, scientific evaluation and speaking 
openly to concerned communities about risks and mitigations 
involved in resource development. 

What has XTO Energy been working on regarding technology 
innovation in unconventional resource development?
Paul: Research and innovation continue to improve both our 
operations and how we manage our footprint. We are involved 
in many studies that have been published in peer-reviewed 
publications. We share the results of these studies with our 
stakeholders to improve the dialogue and to allow science and 
facts to inform policy decisions.

One example is our participation in the groundbreaking Univer-
sity of Texas study that measured methane at 190 natural gas 
well sites in every region of the United States where hydraulic 
fracturing is occurring. This study was led by Dr. David Allen and 
included the Environmental Defense Fund and several indus-
try companies. This survey was the most extensive yet, and it 
highlighted new evidence that methane emissions generated by 
hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production are at the low end 
of recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates.

We are also participating in collaborative research projects to 
more fully understand other impacts of unconventional resource 
development. Our seismology researchers are studying induced 
seismicity, which is a rare occurrence, particularly when associated 
with oil and gas activities such as injection and hydraulic fracturing. 
With regard to water, our Permian Basin operations published a 
study with Halliburton about tests where recycled produced water 
was utilized to hydraulically fracture wells. We also conducted a 
Marcellus shale gas life cycle assessment to determine GHG emis-
sions and freshwater consumption from well activities through 
power plant and consumer consumption. Results showed natural

gas producers have used hydraulic fracturing to produce more 
than 1 million wells safely and effectively. 

gas produces significantly fewer GHG emissions and utilizes less 
water compared with coal (see page 58).

What does XTO Energy see as its biggest opportunity  
in the next few years regarding unconventional  
resource development?
Paul: We have a huge opportunity to gain public confidence 
not only in what we can do now and in the future, but also in 
how the business is effectively regulated to produce safe and 
environmentally protective outcomes. ExxonMobil is working 
to communicate effectively the scientific realities of producing 
shale oil and gas to people who are rightfully skeptical due to 
the contrarian and, in some cases, unfounded messaging from 
antidevelopment activists. We welcome responsible dialogue 
and conversation on this topic.

In addition, the industry needs regulations that provide protec-
tive benefits without constraining innovation, development or 

technology. In the United States, our operations are subject to 
federal, state and local regulations. Every state with unconven-
tional resource development potential has acted or is acting to 
adjust its oil and gas oversight regulations, and federal agencies 
with jurisdiction are doing the same.

Looking to the future, we are going to need more regulators 
at the state level that have an understanding of oil and gas 
operations. It is for this reason that ExxonMobil and General 
Electric each contributed $1 million to three universities 
to develop a curriculum aimed at training the regulators 
of tomorrow. We made the contribution in 2012, and the 
universities had their first curriculum session in August 2013, 
with more to come. With a track record of responsible  
development, we can attain and maintain public confidence.  
There is tremendous economic potential now and into  
the next century.

Economic Growth and 
Development

We support the economic growth 
and development of communities 
where we do business, primarily 
through hiring, training and utilizing 
local workers and suppliers.

Wherever we operate, we provide and spread the direct 
and indirect economic benefits of a competitive oil and gas 
sector by creating new jobs, developing a technically skilled 
workforce, strengthening business practices, purchasing 
goods and services, and creating investment opportunities. 
By collaborating with NGOs, other companies and govern-
ments, we are also able to help achieve community develop-
ment goals. Access to energy underpins many of the United 
Nations Millennium Development Goals, for example.

Building and sustaining local economic growth, while also 
improving social conditions, is at the core of our approach to 
local content development. We specifically focus on training 
and educating a local workforce, developing local vendors 
who can provide goods and services to our business, and 
improving the livelihoods of community members through 
strategic community investments. We describe our community 
investments in more detail on page 68 of this report.

Our National Content Guidelines, Strategies and Best Practices 
contain the key elements of our local content strategy and 

plan, provide models and tools for the successful development 
of local capacity, and detail roles and responsibilities at the 
corporate, country, and project and operations levels. Because 
we work in a variety of countries and communities, each with 
different challenges and opportunities, we tailor our local 
content approach for each location based on specific needs. 
We base our strategy on local factors such as the development 

goals outlined by the government, stakeholder expectations, 
the regulatory environment, the existence and quality of infra-
structure, the business environment and social capacity.

the Baytown Expansion Project

ExxonMobil is working to expand our Baytown Olefins and 
Mont Belvieu Plastics Plants located near Houston, Texas. This 
large-scale expansion, which will add a new ethane cracker 
and premium product facilities to capitalize on abundant 
supplies of natural gas, will create new jobs, spur economic 
development and generate additional tax revenue. As part of 
our planning process, we conducted an economic benefits 
study to understand the potential impacts of this project. 
In the greater Houston area, the expansion is estimated to 
create approximately 10,000 construction jobs, 350 perma-
nent ExxonMobil jobs in the Baytown area and 3,700 related 
jobs in the local community. Nationally, the project will create 
18,000 jobs during its three-year construction phase and 
more than 22,000 permanent jobs when the expansion’s 
facilities become fully operational. These jobs are not limited 
to the petrochemical and supporting industries, but will 
spread throughout the entire U.S. economy, including many 
consumer product and service industries. This project could 
generate regional economic benefits of $870 million annually 
and $3.3 billion each year nationally.

of local employment opportunities wherever we do business. 
We made significant progress in hiring host country nationals 
in 2013. 

•  In Angola, 80 percent of our personnel are Angolan, 14 per-
cent of whom are in supervisory and managerial positions.

•  In Equatorial Guinea, nearly 70 percent of employees are 

Equatoguinean, 13 percent of whom are in supervisory and 
managerial positions.

•  In Indonesia, nearly 90 percent of employees are Indonesian, 

27 percent of whom are women; local staff hold nearly  
75 percent of supervisory and managerial positions.

•  In Nigeria, 91 percent of employees are Nigerian, 15 percent 
of whom are women; 21 percent of local staff are in supervi-
sory and managerial positions.

Our ability to increase local employment depends on the 
supply of qualified individuals. Generally, as economic activity 
in an area increases, the demand for local, skilled workers also 
increases. This can result in a shortage of available workers. 
To address this challenge, we support education and training 
initiatives aimed at increasing the number of individuals from 
which we can select.

Further, in order to help develop the skills of locally hired 
employees, we place experienced ExxonMobil expatriates — 
individuals working in a country other than their country of 
permanent residence — in countries where they can share their 
expertise and train and mentor nationals for operational and 
leadership roles.

Workforce Development in Angola

In the countries where we work, our strategy is to develop a 
strong and high-performing national workforce to meet business 
requirements through appropriate training, challenging and 
rewarding career opportunities, and sustainable succession 
plans. At the early stages of our work in Angola in 2004, we 
brought in a group of experienced ExxonMobil employees who 
were already familiar with our company’s standards of project 
execution. We immediately established training programs and 
hired local individuals, bringing economic benefits to the country. 
Since 2004, as more Angolans received training and on-the-job 
experience, the hiring of nationals has accelerated, resulting in a 
significant reduction in the number of expatriates working in the 
country. At the end of 2013, we had 75 Angolans in leadership 
positions, including 16 offshore supervisors. National workers 
now account for 80 percent of our workforce in the country.

Felicio Neves was the first Angolan to join Esso Angola  
18 years ago. He started his career in the accounting depart-
ment and worked in various roles over the next seven years. 
After two years on an expatriate assignment in Houston, Texas, 
he returned to Angola and held supervisory positions for the 
next 10 years. Since 2012, he has assumed leadership respon-
sibilities as a planning manager. 

“My career development process was hard work but reward-
ing. I encourage everyone that would like to pursue a leader-
ship position within ExxonMobil to have a good attitude and 
to perform your best at all times. It is very important to be 
curious and always willing to learn.”

experience, Yuni said, “I hope every youth around the Banyu 
Urip project is able to participate in this training so that he or 
she has the opportunity to enhance his or her skills and the 
internship to develop his or her skills and attitude.” 

Training a local workforce is one of our priorities. In Indonesia, 
Mobil Cepu Ltd. and ExxonMobil Oil Indonesia Inc.,  
ExxonMobil subsidiaries, offer an Industry Vocational Training 
Program for local men and women to hone their skills. To 
date, we have helped train more than 1,200 young people 
from areas nearby our Arun and Banyu Urip fields in weld-
ing, plumbing, carpentry, forklift operation and electrical 

ExxonMobil’s approach to training and hiring Indonesians has 
led to a workforce composition that is more than 90 percent 
Indonesian. In addition, we have 110 Indonesian trainees, 
some of whom are working as expatriates in Angola, Cam-
eroon, Malaysia, Nigeria and the United States to expand 
their skills before returning to join their fellow graduates and 
support our operations in Indonesia.

we are able to nurture entrepreneurship and foster globally 
competitive businesses. Our goal is to build and maintain a 
qualified, competitive and sustainable supply chain wherever 
we operate. 

In some of the more remote locations where we operate, local 
suppliers sometimes do not have the experience or capacity to 
provide competitive goods and services to support our busi-
ness. We use a number of tools to overcome this challenge. 
For example, in areas where we are growing our business, 
we conduct business process training covering topics such 
as health, safety and security; business ethics; costing and 
tendering; finance and credit; and international standards and 
codes. We look for opportunities to reach out to new suppliers 
either through membership in chambers of commerce or 
similar organizations, or through advertising. In some cases, 
we also advertise supplier requirements early in the contract-
ing process in order to allow local suppliers sufficient time to 
prepare their bids.

At our Sakhalin-1 project in Russia, Exxon Neftegas Limited 
(ENL), a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, has developed an effective 
program to increase participation of Russian companies. We 
use a systematic outreach program to inform Russian compa-
nies of the opportunities and project requirements in advance 
of when goods and services are required. The end result is a 
healthier and more competitive supply chain for the project, 
increased business opportunities for Russian companies and 
more jobs in the regional economy. Approximately $13.3 billion 
in contracts — two-thirds of the total contract value with third-
party vendors — has been awarded to Russian companies or 
joint ventures from 1996 to 2013.

Helping to Improve Supplier  
Safety Performance

ExxonMobil’s high standards for safety extend to those with 
whom we do business, and our suppliers are no exception. 
In addition to using safety performance as a screening tool 
for potential suppliers, we consider safety in the bid evalua-
tion. Standard procurement language provides us the ability 
to suspend or cancel work if a vendor is not meeting our 
safety expectations. We constantly engage with our suppliers 
and share our expectations regarding safety. Many of our 
suppliers have improved their safety performance and have 
established a stronger safety culture after working  
for ExxonMobil. 

For example, AMEC Black & McDonald (ABM), a Canadian 
company that provides project management, engineering, 
construction and maintenance services, has been a supplier to 
ExxonMobil Canada since 2004. In that time, the company has 
adopted a number of ExxonMobil’s safety programs to improve 
its safety culture and performance. The Step Back 5x5 program, 
one of the first programs adopted and still used today as an 
integral part of ABM’s employee orientation, is a brief hazard 
assessment program completed before each task. ABM also 
introduced this program to a number of its own contractors, 
driving the culture of safety further down the supply chain.

ABM personnel conducting safety assessments and job observation 
reporting at an ExxonMobil Canada site. 

“AMEC Black & McDonald Limited has been working with  
ExxonMobil Canada for almost 10 years as a contractor. 
Our cultural growth in safety performance has been pow-
erfully impacted by our relationship with ExxonMobil in an 
extremely direct and positive way. Our world-class safety 
record would have not been possible without ExxonMobil’s  
guidance and support. We have a very strong safety culture, 
with a belief that all incidents are preventable and zero total 
recordable incident rate is achievable. We have proven this 
with our record only because of our involvement with  
ExxonMobil and their expectation that Nobody Gets Hurt.”

Supply Chain Management

The success of our business 
depends on how well we manage 
those who work on our behalf.

Anyone who does business with ExxonMobil can affect our 
operations and our reputation. Our global footprint often 
reaches beyond our own fence line. We rely on our approxi-
mately 160,000 suppliers of goods and services to uphold our 
commitment to operational integrity. Purchases from these sup-
pliers have made a significant positive impact on the economies 
and living standards in the countries where we operate.

Our supply chain management process begins when any  
ExxonMobil business line identifies project or operational needs 
requiring the procurement of third-party goods, services or 
materials. We apply a standardized procurement approach that 
allows us to share the same rigorous standards, accountability 
and good practices worldwide. Our staff is trained to conduct 
supplier prequalification assessments (which include anti-  
corruption due diligence screening where appropriate), perform 
restricted-parties screening and incorporate standard legal terms 
and conditions into contracts. After prequalification, we commu-
nicate project expectations or operational requirements that a 
potential or existing supplier must meet. We then assess poten-
tial suppliers and their capabilities based on operational criticality 
and the level of risk associated with the material or service being 
procured. Considerations can include elements such as:

•  Health, safety, security and environmental requirements

— Mark Healy, President, AMEC Black & McDonald Limited

•  Technical qualifications

•  Design, construction and project assurance and procedures

exxonmobil.com

48

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT2013 Corporate Citizenship Report•  Product quality assurance, including product stewardship

•  Supplier operational, maintenance and control processes

•  Financial qualifications

Additionally, supplier selection can take into account other issues, 
such as the increased participation of the local community and 
of historically underrepresented segments of the population, 
including, but not limited to, women, minorities and indigenous 
peoples. We comply with specific supplier-related require-
ments in each country where we do business. We engage with 
suppliers and provide feedback where they may need to correct 
deficiencies. In certain cases, we terminate our contracts with 
third parties if their performance does not meet ExxonMobil’s 
standards. For information about how ExxonMobil expects sup-
pliers to uphold labor laws and human rights, see page 68. 

In 2013, we began enhancing our detection of potential 
issues, such as forced labor, in our supply chain. We devel-
oped a structured approach that includes screening of our 
supply chain, considering issues like the risk status of particular 
countries and high-risk commodities, coupled with targeted 
interviews. In 2013, we analyzed our supply chain and com-
pleted our first field assessment with a vendor; we did not 
identify any issues. In 2014, we plan to evaluate our program 
and enhance it as appropriate.

Ensuring we have a diverse supply chain is another one of our 
priorities. In the United States, we have a supplier diversity pro-
gram that proactively includes minority- and women-owned 
business enterprises (MWBEs) in our procurement process. In 
2013 alone, we purchased $744 million in goods and services 
directly from MWBEs in the United States. In addition, our sup-
pliers spent $280 million on procurement from MWBEs on our 
behalf, bringing our total expenditure to more than $1 billion. 
For the past eight years, the Women’s Business Enterprise 
National Council has recognized ExxonMobil as one of America’s 
Top Corporations for Women’s Business Enterprises.

Sustainability in the Supply Chain

Collaborating with our suppliers to find efficiencies throughout 
our supply chain benefits everyone involved. Over the past 
several years, we have engaged with our marine vessel suppliers 
and operators to reduce fuel consumption of the vessels used off 
the east coast of Canada. We installed fuel-monitoring equip-
ment on board the vessels to help operators reduce the amount 
of fuel used. So far, we have seen an average reduction in fuel 
consumption of approximately 10 percent. This initiative has 
not only reduced fuel costs, but has decreased associated GHG 
emissions and reduced maintenance costs for these vessels. 

“Maersk Supply Service has benefited greatly from working 
closely with ExxonMobil Canada. Initiatives such as adjusting 
vessels’ operations based on feedback from newly installed 
fuel-monitoring systems on our N class vessels, continued 
focus from both onboard management and shoreside manage-
ment to ensure new ideas such as the benefits of hull cleaning, 
and the close communication between the vessels and the 
Hibernia platform in conducting daily operations as efficiently 
as possible, have led to lower fuel consumption on board, less 
maintenance on vessels’ engines and increased productivity.”

“In early 2009, Secunda Canada was approached by  
ExxonMobil Canada East and challenged to develop a fuel 
stewardship program and improve our fuel consumption 
efficiencies within our fleet. This program has exceeded 
all expectations, with a realization alone in the first year of 

implementation of a decrease in airborne pollutants of  
30 percent and reduced fuel consumption by an average of 
10 percent. This program has proven to be successful and 
sustainable, realizing improved efficiencies year over year.”  

— Darrell Sheppard, VP Operations, Secunda Canada

Transparency

Revenue transparency can reduce 
corruption and make the benefits 
of resource development more 
widely available.

ExxonMobil is committed to the highest standards of business 
conduct and anti-corruption wherever we operate. Our efforts 
to promote revenue transparency have helped fight corruption, 
improve government accountability and promote greater eco-
nomic stability around the world. We believe the most success-
ful transparency initiatives are those that ensure each relevant 
public, private and societal entity is fully engaged and properly 
represented. In addition, the initiatives must respect national 
sovereignty and local norms and apply to every company in 
all sectors working in a country. ExxonMobil has supported 
multistakeholder engagement to achieve revenue transparency 
for many years.

We continuously monitor public policy and local regulatory 
requirements with respect to transparency initiatives. The 
U.S. Dodd-Frank Act requires companies like ExxonMobil to 
undertake certain supply chain due diligence with respect to 
any “conflict minerals” (currently including gold, tantalum, 
tin and tungsten) that may be necessary for the production 
or functionality of the company’s products. Tin and tungsten 
are ingredients in certain catalysts we use in our refineries 
and chemical plants. Accordingly, we have established due 
diligence procedures with our conflict mineral suppliers and 
amended our relevant supply contracts to help ensure the 
conflict minerals we use do not originate from the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjacent countries. Based on 
our due diligence program, we have no reason to believe any 
of the conflict minerals used in the manufacture or function of

sensitive information, while at the same time giving citizens 
of resource-producing countries the information they need 
— in a form that is readily usable — to hold their governments 
accountable. This approach is consistent with ExxonMobil’s 
long history of leadership in pioneering transparency efforts, 
such as through EITI.

In July 2013, the European Union (EU) approved a revised 
accounting directive that mandates government payment 
reporting, similar to the now-vacated SEC rules. Each of 
the EU member states has 24 months to implement rules at 
least as stringent as but not limited to the directive. We are 
concerned about the inconsistency between the new EU rules 
and the direction given to the SEC to revise its rules, which 
will result in multiple and potentially contradictory reporting 
requirements in different jurisdictions. Such a fragmented 
approach would not give civil society a means to compile and 
analyze government revenue or give companies protection of 
commercially sensitive information.  

We will continue to work constructively with the proponents 
of increased revenue transparency toward fair and equitable 
policies and programs that reduce corruption and improve 
governance. Initiatives that pursue those goals provide for a 
more stable business climate, which in turn supports stronger 
and more sustainable economic development.

any ExxonMobil product in 2013 may have originated in the 
DRC or any adjoining country.  

One important global program that encourages transpar-
ency and collaboration among governments, companies, civil 
society and financial institutions is the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is dedicated to strengthen-
ing governance by improving transparency and accountability 
in this sector. Companies and governments participating in 
EITI separately report payments and revenues, respectively, 
allowing EITI to reconcile any differences between the totals 
and publish validated total government revenues.

ExxonMobil has actively participated in EITI since the pro-
gram’s inception in 2002, at both the secretariat and country 
levels, including continuous participation on the EITI board as 
either a primary or alternate member. Our efforts related to 
EITI during the past year have focused on working with the 
board to develop and implement its new standards for mem-
ber country participation. Numerous countries where we 
have operations are working on becoming, or have become, 
EITI members. ExxonMobil supports the EITI application, 
validation and implementation processes of Azerbaijan, 
Cameroon, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakh-
stan, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Ukraine and the 
United States, and of potential new applicant EITI countries 
including Australia, Colombia, Papua New Guinea and the 
United Kingdom.

In August 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) published new rules for global government payment 
reporting as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The initial SEC 
rules were vacated by a U.S. District Court, so the SEC must 
now develop new reporting rules. The American Petroleum 
Institute (API), of which ExxonMobil is a member, has devel-
oped and submitted recommendations to the SEC outlining 
a new approach to transparency reporting that we believe 
is superior both to the original SEC approach and to other 
approaches currently being considered around the world. The

Mitigating Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions

In 2013, we continued to  
manage our greenhouse gas 
emissions through enhanced 
equipment reliability and  
increased energy efficiency.

Since energy use is pervasive in every aspect of life around the 
world, and since policies to address GHG — and more specifi-
cally CO2 — emissions will tend to raise the cost of energy and 
related activities, many countries are taking care in structuring 
both the nature and the pace of GHG policy initiatives. This 
approach is understandable as a way to manage climate risks 
associated with GHG emissions while also minimizing related 
policy impacts on local economies, industrial competitiveness, 
energy security and people’s ability to pay higher costs.

mechanism. For example, in most OECD nations, we assume 
an implied cost of CO2 emissions that will reach about $80 per 
metric ton in 2040. OECD nations are likely to continue to lead 
the way in adopting these policies, with developing nations 
gradually following, led by China.

At the operational level, we work to lower GHG emissions by 
increasing energy efficiency and managing flaring and venting 
in our operations in the short term, implementing proven 
reduction technologies in the medium term, and developing 
breakthrough, game-changing technologies in the long term.

MANAGING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS2013 Corporate Citizenship Report 
 
in the world, ExxonMobil is well-positioned to provide 
access to this clean energy source for power generation.

In 2013, ExxonMobil’s net equity GHG emissions were  
126 million metric tons, which is essentially flat compared with 
our 2012 performance. We continue to seek opportunities 
to lower our GHG emissions. For example, the new steam 
cracker at our Singapore refining and petrochemical complex 
can process an unprecedented range of feedstocks, includ-
ing crude oil. Converting crude directly into chemicals saves 
energy and reduces emissions by eliminating the refining steps 
required to produce naphtha.

FLARING AND VENTING
During crude oil extraction, a blend of hydrocarbon gases 
often accompanies oil to the surface. In certain situations, we 
flare or vent this gas either as a safety measure or as a means 
of disposal when there are no economic options for capturing 
and using it. In order to pursue commercial alternatives 
for utilizing associated gas, we need business environments 
with the right conditions, including available markets, nearby 
infrastructure and appropriate regulations. Many of these 
conditions are not currently available in some locations where 
we operate, particularly in Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.

Therefore, the reduction of gas flaring is an ongoing challenge 
for ExxonMobil’s operations in these areas. Since 2007, 
ExxonMobil has reduced its rate of flaring in Nigeria by  
74 percent due to significant investments in oil production 
enhancement projects with flaring reduction benefits, the 
implementation of an improved equipment maintenance program 
and the application of a senior management-supported 
Flaring Reduction Protocol. Mobil Producing Nigeria Limited, 
an ExxonMobil affiliate, is also active in the Nigeria Flare 
Reduction Committee, a collaboration between international 
oil and gas companies operating in the country, the Department 
of Petroleum Resources and the federal government.

Venting is the release of methane without flaring. We minimize 
venting volumes to ensure the safety of our personnel and 
facilities, and to reduce our impact on the environment. Meth-
ane emissions from all sources, including venting, represent 
less than 4 percent of our direct GHG emissions. 

In accordance with the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Initiative, 
of which ExxonMobil is a charter member, and as specified in 
our Upstream Flaring and Venting Reduction Environmental 
Standard for Projects, our aim is to avoid routine flaring and 
venting of natural gas in new projects. We also design new 
projects to avoid venting reservoir CO2 that is produced, where 
practical. In 2013, our combined Upstream, Downstream 
and Chemical flaring volume was 3.7 million metric tons, or 
approximately 10 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent GHG 
emissions. This performance is essentially flat compared with 
2012, but represents a reduction of approximately 50 percent 
over the past decade.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY
In 2013, energy used in our operations totaled 1.5 billion giga-
joules, which is consistent with our 2012 energy usage. Over 
the past decade, we improved energy efficiency by approxi-
mately 10 percent in refining and chemical manufacturing. We 
pursue a variety of projects to improve energy efficiency. Since 
2000, we have used our Global Energy Management System 

(GEMS) in the Downstream and Chemical business lines to 
identify and act on energy-savings opportunities. The GEMS 
equivalent in the Upstream business is the Production Opera-
tions Energy Management System (POEMS).

ExxonMobil’s Global Real Estate and Facilities Group has been 
working on an initiative to analyze energy use, water use and 
waste generation across our office facilities. In 2013, we contin-
ued construction of our new energy-efficient 383-acre campus  
in Houston, Texas. The new office buildings are designed 
to be 40 percent more energy efficient than a typical Houston 
office building.

Developing Cutting-Edge 
Technology

We invest in new technologies with 
transformative potential to increase 
energy supplies, reduce emissions 
and improve operational efficiency.

We have spent nearly $5.2 billion on research and develop-
ment since 2009, including on technologies specifically related 
to reducing GHG and other air emissions. Our research port-
folio includes a wide range of technologies, such as carbon 
capture and storage, cogeneration, biomass conversion and 
biofuels. We continue to monitor the competitive environment 
for game-changing opportunities.

CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) involves capturing, 
transporting and storing CO2 in underground geologic 
formations such as saline reservoirs, depleted oil or gas 
reservoirs, or deep coal beds. In the future, CCS could be 

one of several important technologies needed to help reduce 
CO2 emissions, with the greatest opportunity being in the  
coal- and natural gas-fired power sector. However, the 
application of CCS will likely be limited in the nearer term by the 
high cost of carbon capture and the need for effective legal 
and regulatory frameworks — including long-term responsibil-
ity for stored CO2 — public acceptance, industry infrastructure 
and the commercial demonstration of the entire CCS process 
in power sector applications. CCS economics can be improved 
when the CO2 is applied to enhanced oil recovery in some 
amenable locations. ExxonMobil has extensive experience in 
the critical components of CCS, and we continue to conduct 
in-house research to improve the economics of this technology.

or industrial manufacturing facilities.

STEP 2: TRANSPORTING CO2
The second step is transporting the captured CO2 to the stor-
age site — underground geologic formations such as depleted 
oil or gas reservoirs.

STEP 3: INJECTING CO2

The third and final component of CCS is injecting CO2 into 
underground reservoirs for storage.

COGENERATION

Through ongoing incorporation of cogeneration into  
our facilities, ExxonMobil is able to generate power more  
efficiently than many local utilities. Cogeneration captures  
heat generated from the production of electricity for use  
in production, refining and chemical processing operations. 
Due to its inherent energy efficiency, the use of cogeneration 
also leads to reduced GHG emissions. We have interests  
in approximately 5,300 megawatts of cogeneration  
capacity in more than 100 installations at more than  
30 locations around the world. This capacity is equivalent  
to the annual energy needs of 2.5 million U.S. homes.  
In 2013, we added 42 megawatts of additional capacity  
at our Augusta refinery in Italy. We plan to add  
approximately 300 megawatts by 2015 through other 
projects. Since 2004, we have invested more than $1 billion  
in cogeneration projects.

Up Close: 
Life Cycle Assessment 

We use life cycle assessment (LCA) in accordance with 
the guidance set by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006). 
ExxonMobil’s experts contribute to studies and training 
programs related to LCA. In the past three years, our 
experts have published three peer-reviewed articles on 
LCA and have collaborated with well-known academics 
and other third-party experts on the development of new 
approaches to improve LCA methodologies. We partici-
pated in the United Nations Environment Programme’s Life 
Cycle Initiative to encourage the increased use of life cycle 
thinking globally. In addition, ExxonMobil experts spear-
headed the development and publication of the Interna-
tional Council of Chemical Association’s LCA Executive 
Guide, a short educational document for executives and 
decision-makers. 

In 2013, ExxonMobil experts conducted an LCA to determine 
the GHG emissions associated with the production of 
natural gas in the Marcellus Shale region of the United 
States. This analysis accounted for all phases of the shale 

gas life cycle — from drilling and production to transmis-
sion and generation of electricity. The study concluded that 
activities associated with hydraulic fracturing contributed less 
than 2 percent of the life cycle GHG emissions associated with 
the produced gas. Approximately 87 percent of emissions 
are attributable to power generation, and approximately 11 
percent are associated with the use of natural gas to fuel com-
pressors. The combustion of gas at power plants to generate 
electricity is the primary source of emissions. Investment in 
increased efficiencies and new technologies throughout the 
entire life cycle will continue to reduce emissions. In total,  
the GHG emissions and freshwater consumption associated 
with the production of shale gas are about 50 percent lower 
than that of coal, regardless of the source or composition  
of the gas. In addition, hydraulic fracturing operations  
only account for approximately 6 percent of the life cycle 
freshwater consumption.

We also conducted a comparative LCA to quantify the poten-
tial environmental impacts of synthetic passenger vehicle and 
industrial gear lubricants. The scope of this study included 
the entire lubricant life cycle, from raw materials extraction to 
the end-of-life phase. The results indicate there are significant 
environmental advantages associated with the use of synthetic 
lubricants due to improved equipment efficiency and long 
drain intervals. The longer drain intervals translate into reduced 
material use and waste generation. For example, by using 
Mobil SHC 600 in gearboxes, a typical industrial plant could 
save up to 250 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, equal 
to the power consumed by 22 U.S. households in one year.

OTHER RESEARCH INVESTMENTS
ExxonMobil also invests in research to reduce energy use and 
emissions related to the use of our products. We recognize  
the responsibility to assist our customers in reducing emissions 
throughout their activities. For example, our Fuels & Lubricants 
business has started to embed sustainability throughout the 

entire customer engagement process. Products such  
as Mobil Delvac 1TM LE 5W-30 and Mobil DTE 10 Excel™  
allow for reduced energy consumption and operating costs  
for our customers, as well as reduced GHG emissions.

MANAGING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS2013 Corporate Citizenship ReportEngaging on Climate Change 
Policy and Planning

We engage with policymakers 
directly and through trade 
associations around the world 
to encourage sound policy 
solutions for addressing the 
risks of climate change.

PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT

Reducing GHG emissions hinges on appropriate public 
policies that seek to reduce the risks posed by climate change 
at minimum cost to society, while recognizing the importance 
of abundant, reliable, affordable energy for global economic 
development. Developing countries already account for more 
than half of current GHG emissions globally, and by around 
2020, cumulative historical GHG emissions from developing 
and developed economies will be equal. Therefore, both 
developed countries and the major developing economies 
need to participate in crafting policies aimed at mitigating 
global CO2 emissions. Policy discussions in developed  
countries should also recognize the role of energy in  
economic development.

physical risks associated with climate change. While most 
scientists agree climate change poses risks related to extreme 
weather, sea level rise, temperature extremes and precipitation 
changes, current scientific understanding provides limited 
guidance on the likelihood, magnitude or time frame of these 
events. Anticipating the likelihood of an event at the regional 
or local level in comparison to global averages is even more 
difficult. Nevertheless, our facilities are designed, constructed 
and operated to withstand a variety of extreme conditions, 
with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering 
uncertainties, including those associated with potential climate 
change impacts. We continue to engage with major engineer-
ing societies, international organizations and industry groups 
to develop sound engineering perspectives on managing the 
risks of climate change.

A variety of policy strategies can contribute to GHG emis-
sions reductions, such as cap-and-trade rules, carbon taxes, 
increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for 
renewable energy. ExxonMobil participates in GHG emissions 
trading when cost-effective, in areas of our operations where 
regulated trading schemes exist. However, we believe a 
well-designed, revenue-neutral carbon tax program provides 
a more cost-effective alternative to a cap-and-trade regime for 
reducing GHG emissions. We believe this approach ensures 
a uniform and predictable cost of carbon, lets market prices 
drive solutions, maximizes transparency to stakeholders, 
reduces administrative complexity, promotes global participa-
tion, and is easily adjusted to future developments in climate 
science and policy impacts.

Our scientists have been involved in climate change research 
and related policy analysis for nearly 30 years. This undertaking 
has yielded more than 45 papers in peer-reviewed publica-
tions. Experts from our organization have served on the United 
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change since 
its inception, and continue to be engaged today. ExxonMobil 
funds or collaborates on climate-related research at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, the University of California at Riverside, Pacific 
Northwest National Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy, Stanford University and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean 
Sciences. In 2013, we collaborated with the University of 
California at Riverside on a study aimed at improving computer 
modeling of black carbon in the atmosphere. ExxonMobil also 
played an integral role in organizing a major industry workshop 
through IPIECA on short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). The 
workshop explored the basic science of SLCFs, natural and 
anthropogenic emission sources of SLCFs, and the role of the 
oil and gas industry.

Advancing the 
Environmental, 
Socioeconomic  
and Health Impact 
Assessment Process

ExxonMobil employees and contractors meeting with stakeholders in northern Cameroon as part of a review of the process used to develop 
the Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessment for the Chad/Cameroon pipeline project.

Although our projects and operations offer a variety of 
benefits to local communities and host countries, they can 
also carry environmental, socioeconomic and health (ESH) 
risks and challenges that need to be addressed during project 
planning, implementation and operations. Our goal is to 
maximize the benefits and prevent or manage the risks. Impact 
assessments help us do this — when starting major Upstream 
projects, we identify and evaluate ESH risks and opportunities 
by conducting an Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health 
Impact Assessment (ESHIA). 

When conducting an ESHIA for a project, we first study and 
understand the ESH setting. We then identify how our activities 
will or could interact with the physical, biological and 
human environment; consult with stakeholders; identify and 
evaluate positive and negative actual and potential impacts; 
determine the risks associated with these impacts; avoid the 

identified risks or reduce the level of risk to an acceptable 
level; and develop an appropriate monitoring plan. We 
capture the findings and recommendations from the impact 
assessment process and translate them into a management 
plan, most often referred to as an Environmental, Socio-
economic and Health Management Plan (EMP). The EMP is 
implemented, tracked and modified as necessary throughout 
the life of the activity. 

Since 2007, ExxonMobil has conducted or participated in  
169 ESHIAs for projects and activities of varying scopes 
around the world. Conducting impact assessments is integral 
to implementing a project successfully and developing long-
term, positive relationships with the communities and host 
countries where we operate. In 2013, we developed an ESHIA 
Guide for our Upstream professionals to help ensure a consis-
tent approach when conducting these assessments. 

We recently performed a review of the process used to 
develop the ESHIA and EMP for the Chad/Cameroon pipeline 
project, which encompasses activities and facilities in the 
west-central African countries of Chad and Cameroon. 
Construction began in 2000, and full production commenced 
in 2004. ExxonMobil conducted an ESHIA for the project 
between 1993 and 1999, and we produced the EMP there-
after. The ESHIA and EMP development process included 
nearly 900 village-level stakeholder engagement sessions 
in both countries, and public consultation and engagement 
continues to this day. 

Our review of the ESHIA/EMP development process for the 
Chad/Cameroon pipeline project allowed us to capture lessons 
learned, identify opportunities to improve the overall process, 
and develop and implement enhanced risk management strat-
egies and measures. The review team included ExxonMobil

Based on the review, the team determined a key strength 
of the ESHIA/EMP development process for the project 
was its far-reaching and sustained stakeholder engagement 
process. The extensive multiyear consultation process helped 
build support for the project, avoid disruptions and schedule 
delays, develop and implement appropriate environmental 
and socioeconomic safeguards, and deliver compensatory 
and social development programs for the most affected 
communities. The review team also identified several areas 
of improvement for the company ’s ESHIA/EMP development 
process, including:

•  The need for a greater emphasis on full life cycle land use, 
supported by a comprehensive and continuously updated 
environmental, health and social database that can better 
inform compensation and social development programs 

•  The design and delivery of compensation, resettlement and 
social development programs that have a higher probability 
of long-term sustainability and success

•  A more detailed evaluation of the ESH ramifications of 

obtaining certain construction materials such as water, sand, 
gravel and rock

Overall, the review demonstrated the ESHIA/EMP 
development process for the Chad/Cameroon pipeline 
project was successful in identifying and evaluating the 
highest-level ESH risks and appropriately managing them. 
We have subsequently applied this information to improve our 
overall ESHIA process for new opportunities going forward.

We work in communities all over the world, each with their 
own unique cultures, needs and sensitivities. Responsibly 
managing our economic and social impacts on communities, 
maintaining a fundamental respect for their human rights and 
making valued social investments in their livelihoods help us 
maintain our license to operate. 

Managing Community Impacts

We aim to develop human,  
social and economic capacity 
in a way that benefits people, 
communities and our business. 
Achieving this goal requires  
us to manage our social and 
economic impacts actively and 
responsibly in the communities  
where we live and work. 

CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Consulting with communities during the early stages of a 
project allows us to identify opportunities and concerns and 
design effective risk management measures during the project 
planning phase. By endeavoring to avoid or mitigate as many 
concerns as possible at the onset, we are able to avert project 
disruptions, avoid delays, reduce costs and prevent the  
escalation of issues. Our Best Practices in External Affairs 
(BPEA) governs our community awareness programs and 

Stakeholder Engagement: 
Community Engagement in  
South Africa and Colombia

As we extend our reach into new areas, it is imperative that we 
engage with local communities from the onset. For example, 
in 2013, ExxonMobil began considering new operations in 
the Transkei/Algoa Exploration Area on the South African 
coastline. In partnership with our co-venturer, Impact Africa, 
a team of ExxonMobil employees and consultants led a series 
of community engagement meetings in the area. The key 
objectives were to communicate currently envisioned project 
options, develop relationships with community members 
and discuss environmental sensitivities with key stakeholders. 
Audience members included local environmental authorities, 
NGOs, marine researchers and community members. Three 
stakeholder meetings were held in Port St. Johns, East London 
and Port Elizabeth in June. Through this process, we were able 
to open communication channels between the project team 
and these communities. We were also able to collect informed 
comments about how the public could be impacted by the 
proposed exploration activities. We look forward to advancing 
potential exploration activities in South Africa and growing our 
presence in that country.

We are also progressing plans to start onshore exploration in 
the Middle Magdalena Valley region in Colombia. To address 
local citizens’ potential concerns, ExxonMobil led a team 
to begin community engagement in this area. Community 
engagement specialists have held more than 100 meetings to 
date in three different regions, focusing on social engagement, 

environmental studies and other topics. More than 3,600 local 
citizens have attended these meetings to date. The meetings 
have helped establish an ongoing dialogue and identify key 
community needs, such as potable water treatment systems, 
which ExxonMobil may be able to provide. ExxonMobil strives 
to have a positive impact in each community in which we 
operate. We believe strong, informed communities pave the 
way for a successful business environment.

the specific needs, expectations and interests of host  
communities and align those needs with our community 
investment programs. 

Ensuring mutual understanding, trust and respect in our  
stakeholder relationships means that interested parties are 
represented as agreements are established. It also helps us 
establish constructive relationships with stakeholders who can 
provide valuable input into the decision-making process over 
the long term. Once a project starts, we provide local groups 
and individuals with a communication channel to voice and 
resolve concerns without fear of retribution. For information 
about our grievance process, see page 66. 

MANAGING SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS AND RISKS
Oil and gas-related projects have the potential to impact indi-
viduals, communities and the environment. Early identification, 
planning and engagement are essential to optimize opportuni-
ties for creating and enhancing positive socioeconomic effects 
and for successfully implementing appropriate avoidance and 
risk mitigation measures. 

In 2012, we endorsed and implemented our Upstream Socio-
economic Management Standard for Projects. This Standard is 
designed to help ExxonMobil identify potential socioeconomic 
issues and risks early in the Upstream life cycle and develop 
and implement appropriate avoidance and prevention, control, 
mitigation, compensation and monitoring measures. 

The Standard outlines different expectations that are intended 
to be implemented based on the identification of relevant 
socioeconomic risks, including indigenous peoples, impact 
assessment and mitigation, human rights, transparency and 
corruption, cultural heritage and diversity, community rela-
tions, land use and resettlement, and economic development. 

INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 

Our operations can take place in areas inhabited by indige-
nous peoples. We respect and engage indigenous communi-
ties, and we work to protect their cultures and customs. We 
believe developing opportunities for indigenous communities 
to participate in training and employment benefits these 
communities and our business. Our approach to interacting 
with indigenous peoples around the world is consistent with 
the principles of the International Labor Organization (ILO) 
Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries, the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the International Finance Cor-
poration (IFC) Performance Standards on Environmental and 
Social Sustainability, and the World Bank Operational Policy 
and Bank Procedure on Indigenous Peoples. Our operations 
in Alaska, Cameroon, Canada, Indonesia, Nigeria, Papua New 
Guinea and Sakhalin Island involve working directly with indig-
enous peoples. Our first objective is to determine how each 
group prefers to be engaged. The community establishes its 
preference for how often and how long their members meet 
with ExxonMobil representatives, and whom the community 
chooses to provide its viewpoints or represent its wishes.

We are sensitive to local communities’ concerns about 
balancing their cultural heritage with the desire for economic 
development, even after our operations have ceased. Wher-
ever we work with indigenous peoples, we support both local 
employment initiatives and cultural heritage programs through 
local content and strategic community investments.

LAND USE, RESETTLEMENT  
AND GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS

We employ a number of practices for respecting property 
rights in communities where we operate, and we pay particu-
lar attention to those areas where indigenous peoples live. The 
revised IFC Performance Standards, effective in 2012, require 
companies to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of 
indigenous peoples before initiating development activities on

prior and informed consent to gain clarity on its definition and 
best practices for implementation. An ExxonMobil employee 
is part of this task force, which is ongoing. Our Upstream 
Socioeconomic Management Standard for Projects includes 
expectations for free, prior and informed consultation with 
indigenous peoples. 

We strive to work collaboratively and transparently with 
local communities, including indigenous peoples, to foster 
ongoing support for our activities. We minimize involuntary 
resettlement through consultations with local communities 
and project design and implementation. When resettlement is 
unavoidable, like for our Papua New Guinea Liquefied Natural 
Gas Project, we seek to ensure restoration of the livelihoods of 
displaced persons, and we apply international best practices 
aligned with the IFC’s Performance Standards. All of our  
activities are authorized by law and are conducted in  
consultation with and subject to approval by appropriate  
government agencies.

When physical and economic displacement occurs, we 
develop and implement Resettlement Action Plans that are 
informed by landowner consultation and surveying and 
mapping of housing structures, gardens and other assets. If it 
is determined a household does not want to move, or wants 
to move but may have some reservations related to moving, 
ExxonMobil works to identify alternatives or provide additional 
assistance, as needed. There are several cases where we have 
rerouted infrastructure or chosen an alternative site for  
a facility to address resettlement-related concerns.

As part of this process, we work with the landowners to 
confirm what assets are to be compensated, agree to the rates 
and establish the final compensation amount. In Papua New 
Guinea, the process also included the presence of an inde-
pendent advocacy professional who ensured the landowner 
understood his or her rights, what would be compensated and 

Stakeholder Engagement: 
Learning from Our Stakeholders  
in Papua New Guinea

The Papua New Guinea Liquefied Natural Gas Project spans a 
large geographic area of challenging terrain, including remote 
locations with either limited or no forms of telecommunica-
tion, electricity or infrastructure. In addition, there are approxi-
mately 800 different languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, 
along with a wide range of culturally acceptable engagement 
protocols that apply to tribal clans. We have found the use of 
nontraditional methods of stakeholder engagement to over-
come geographic, language and cultural boundaries is advan-
tageous in Papua New Guinea. This approach has helped us 
identify new opportunities and adjust field activities to better 
meet the needs of our stakeholders. 

To engage effectively with landowners, community orga-
nizations, NGOs, multiple levels of government and other 
interested stakeholders, we use diverse methods of stake-
holder engagement, including a combination of both formal 
group meetings and informal engagements as we encounter 
members of the community along roads and in villages  
near project sites. We learned about the value of using  
a variety of engagement methods — such as drama, a  
common form of learning in Papua New Guinea — to  
deliver important construction and safety messages to  
communities more effectively. 

Community members in Papua New Guinea participate in stake-
holder engagement meetings. 

we have implemented a grievance mechanism that allows 
stakeholders to register their concerns with field officers, who 
then enter the details into a central information management 
system. The grievance mechanism features a five-step process: 
publicizing the process; receipt and registration of grievances; 
grievance review and investigation; resolution and response; 
and monitoring and evaluation. Through the grievance 
mechanism and the project’s broader stakeholder engagement 
process, we have been able to identify trends and work with 
people to find solutions. Issues and grievances received during 
the construction phase related mainly to concerns about 
compensation for land use, the resettlement of some residents, 
access to land, impacts on food resources and perceived 
threats to the environment and cultural sites. 

The project’s stakeholder engagement process, including its 
related grievance mechanism process, has also helped us learn 
about what we did well in communities and where people 
wanted us to extend community-based programs. It has also 
enabled stakeholders to contribute to continuous improve-
ment. For example, members of one village raised an issue, 
so project personnel and local community members worked 
together to establish water catchment facilities that benefited 
both the villagers and the project.

We also give community members the opportunity to provide 
input. In some cases, communities have raised concerns about 
project activities, so as part of our stakeholder engagement

the rates of compensation. In developing countries, resettled 
landowners or users then identify a location to build their new 
home, and we provide assistance to re-establish their house-
hold at the new location. We also monitor and evaluate their 
livelihood restoration progress for up to two years. We have 
an assessment team identify resettled individuals or groups 
who may be more vulnerable to not being able to re-establish 
their livelihoods than others, such as single-parent households, 
handicapped individuals or the elderly. We provide special 
assistance to these vulnerable households.

Respecting Human Rights

Human rights are fundamental to 
society; we strive to respect human 
rights everywhere we do business 
through training and compliance 
with guiding principles.

Our approach to human rights is consistent with the policy 
framework outlined in the 2008 report of John Ruggie, the 
United Nations Special Representative on Business and Human 
Rights. This framework recognizes the distinctly different but 
complementary roles of government and business with regard 
to human rights — the government’s duty to protect human 
rights and corporations’ responsibility to respect them.

The United Nations Framework and Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights was released in 2011 to provide 
further guidance on implementing the “protect, respect, 
remedy” framework. These Guiding Principles emphasize 
operational due diligence; in other words, corporations should 
be aware of potential adverse impacts with human rights

Working with Indigenous  
Peoples in Northern Alaska

In the vicinity of our Point Thomson Project in northern Alaska, 
we work with the local communities and government authori-
ties to understand their concerns and avoid conflicts with their 
traditional lifestyle. Through a comprehensive assessment and 
regular engagement, we have identified several areas of con-
cern to the local people, and we have adopted corresponding 
measures to address these concerns. 

For example, the Kaktovik community — located 60 miles to 
the east of the Project — relies, in part, on hunting and fishing 
for its food supply. The 22-mile Point Thomson Export Pipe-
line runs through caribou habitat, which occurs in many loca-
tions throughout northern Alaska. Consequently, we designed 
the pipeline to be 7 feet high to minimize the deflection of 
caribou migration patterns. Additionally, we have applied a 
non-glare metallic coating on the outside of the pipeline to 
reduce visual effects to wildlife in the area. Through consul-
tation with the residents of Kaktovik, we also designed the 
pipeline with thicker walls in certain areas to provide protec-
tion against accidental strikes from coastal hunters.

implications and implement prevention measures as appropri-
ate. The IFC’s revised Performance Standards on Environmental 
and Social Sustainability, published in 2012, reflect the  
Guiding Principles regarding human rights matters. In 2013, 
IPIECA issued a guidance document with suggestions for 
implementing the Guiding Principles in the oil and gas industry.  
ExxonMobil recognizes the importance of successful voluntary 
human rights initiatives and supports IPIECA’s proactive efforts 
to address the expectations of the Guiding Principles for  
our industry.

We provide a human rights awareness training program for 
personnel who work in high-risk areas. This training includes 
information about the Voluntary Principles on Security and 
Human Rights, the requirements of ExxonMobil’s Statement 
and Framework on Security and Human Rights and expecta-
tions regarding the implementation of the Framework in a given 
country. In 2013, we provided security and human rights train-
ing to approximately 500 ExxonMobil employees and security 
personnel in Chad, Colombia, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Papua 
New Guinea, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, 
we are in the process of working with a consultant to develop a 
computer-based human rights training program. We expect to 
roll out a pilot of this instructional module later this year. 

Since 2002, ExxonMobil has actively participated in the  
Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Most 
countries where ExxonMobil works rely on the use of unarmed 
private security providers. However, in some locations, the local 
governments provide security personnel. In these cases, we still 
expect these personnel to uphold human rights. Our State-
ment and Framework on Security and Human Rights helps 
implement the Voluntary Principles, and includes guidance on 
working with host government security personnel, developing 
approaches for working with private security providers, report-
ing and establishing recordkeeping templates. Over the past 
five years, the portion of our private security contracts contain-
ing specific requirements to uphold human rights has increased 
from 60 percent to approximately 99 percent.

Our commitment to human rights extends to our workforce 
and is supported by our Standards of Business Conduct and 
Statement on Labor and the Workplace, which articulates  
our support for the principles of the ILO 1998 Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, namely the 
elimination of child labor, forced labor and workplace discrim-
ination. We also seek business partners that observe similar 
standards. Our standard contract language requires adher-
ence to all applicable laws and regulations related to safety, 
security, health and the environment. ExxonMobil’s procure-
ment group also includes clauses in requests for quotations 
that require our business partners to abide by the prohibition 
of child and forced labor and the payment of wages in accor-
dance with local regulations.

Strategic Community Investments 

Our strategic community 
investments are aligned with a 
country’s economic and social 
goals, and complement our 
business focus. In 2013, we 
contributed $269 million to 
communities around the world.

We engage in public-private partnerships and ongoing 
stakeholder engagement to improve social and economic 
conditions. We do so by focusing the majority of our spend-
ing on our signature, corporate-led initiatives to advance 
economic opportunities for women, improve education and 
combat malaria. We supplement our corporate-led initiatives 

with community-specific programs, ranging from improving 
access to clean, potable water to tackling public health issues. 
We consider the development goals of each community when 
deciding when, where and how best to invest.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND MANAGING COMMUNITY IMPACTS2013 Corporate Citizenship ReportWOMEN’S ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE
Research shows that when women have control over their 
incomes, they are able to invest more fully in the health,  
education and well-being of their families. They also tend to 
reach out and propel other women forward, creating a  
powerful multiplier effect that benefits society as a whole.   
In 2013, ExxonMobil invested more than $10 million in pro-
moting economic opportunities for women. This support  
has reached tens of thousands of women in more than  
90 countries. Over the past nine years, we have provided  
more than $70 million worldwide. In 2012, we partnered  
with the UN Foundation to produce a report about the most 
effective interventions that directly advance women’s  
economic opportunities. For information about the UN  
Foundation Research Partnership report, see page 72.

MATH AND SCIENCE INITIATIVE

Scientists and engineers are critical for addressing the chal-
lenges of the 21st century. From medicine to energy develop-
ment to computing, we need a strong global workforce that 
helps solve problems and creates new opportunities. This is 
why we invest in education programs that focus on inspiring 
students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics (STEM), including programs that focus on 
teacher development and training. Over the past 14 years, we 
have contributed $937 million for education programs globally. 
In 2013 alone, we directed $100 million toward education 
initiatives worldwide, with $38 million specifically for math and 
science education in the United States. 

MALARIA INITIATIVE
Significant progress has been made in the global fight against 
malaria. Between 2000 and 2012, the scale-up of prevention 
interventions and enhanced access to proper diagnosis and 
treatment helped to reduce the global malaria mortality rate 
by 45 percent. However, there are still more than 200 million 

A microfinance mentor in Indonesia provides

One meaningful step to improve U.S. educational outcomes is 
to ensure the Common Core State Standards are fully imple-
mented across the country so we can begin to encourage 
deeper learning and more critical thinking among students. 
The Common Core State Standards establish expectations for 
critical mathematics and language arts knowledge and the 
skills that students from kindergarten to 12th grade should 
master for college and career readiness. They stipulate what 
each student should know and be able to do, but how students 
are taught is determined at the local level. 

We are working with many others to advocate for successful 
implementation of the Common Core because we recognize 
improving U.S. educational performance is vital to the success 
of our industry and to broader national competitiveness in the 
years to come. Our chairman and CEO has publicly voiced 
ExxonMobil’s support for the Standards and their potential 
to improve all students’ ability to succeed, regardless of race, 
gender or socioeconomic status. His leadership on the issue 
serves as a model for other business leaders to emulate. To

astating impact across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. We have 
been working to help build a better future for communities in 
affected regions by investing in the fight against malaria — a 
preventable and treatable disease. Working with a variety of 
partners, between 2000 and 2013 our funding has reached 
more than 105 million beneficiaries. Our support has helped 
distribute more than 13 million bed nets, nearly 2 million doses 
of antimalarial drugs, more than 1 million diagnostic tests and 
training for more than 355,000 workers. Since 2000, we have 

invested more than $120 million in cash grants to organizations 
fighting malaria. In 2013 alone, we provided $13 million to  
18 organizations, benefiting 22 million people in 12 countries. 

A number of factors, including heavier than normal rainfall, 
led to a spike in malaria cases in Chad and Cameroon in 2013. 
ExxonMobil has a strong presence in these countries, and we 
worked with our partners to coordinate an effective response 
strategy. We provided additional funding to replenish bed net 
supplies, increase utilization of bed nets through public messag-
ing campaigns, and advocate for treatment of pregnant women 
in clinics and health posts. For more information about our 
response in Chad, see page 71.

Measuring Our Impact

We continually strive to improve our understanding of the 
impact of our community investments in order to ensure 
their sustainability and maximize the benefits of our efforts 
and resources. In 2013, we invested new resources into 
our measurement work and began conducting a thorough 
internal analysis of our philanthropic programs and mea-
surement frameworks. Working closely with our partners, 
we are designing a more robust system to capture outcomes 
— beyond dollars spent and activities conducted — and 
develop transparent, data-driven methods to maximize  
the design of our philanthropic activities to have the  
greatest impact.

Employee Participation

ExxonMobil and our employees 
support community projects  
through financial contributions  
and volunteer time.

Our worldwide spending includes contributions to  
nonprofit organizations, but we also invest in social  
projects through collaboration with other organizations.  
In 2013, Exxon Mobil Corporation, our divisions and affili-
ates, and the ExxonMobil Foundation provided a combined 
$228 million in cash, goods and services worldwide. Of  
that total, $118 million supported U.S. communities and  
$110 million supported communities in other countries.

Through company-sponsored volunteer programs, more 
than 21,200 ExxonMobil employees, retirees and their  
families donated approximately 711,500 volunteer hours  
to more than 5,100 charitable organizations in 32 coun-
tries in 2013. Employees and retirees donated $41 million 
through ExxonMobil’s matching gift, disaster relief and

WOMEN’S ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE

In the summer of 2013, ExxonMobil partnered with the 
George W. Bush Institute to host the African First Ladies  
Summit — “Investing in Women: Strengthening Africa.” The 
summit served as a useful platform for Africa’s first ladies as 
they work to cultivate change for millions of women in their 
respective nations and around the world. First ladies from 
Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, South 
Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia attended the event, as 
well as government officials, academics, business leaders and 
a variety of representatives from organizations worldwide. 
President and Mrs. Bush kicked off the two-day event, and 
First Lady Michelle Obama participated in a question-and- 
answer session. Among other topics, representatives  
discussed the role of technology in creating new economic 
opportunities for women. For more information, see

MALARIA INITIATIVE

The 2013 emergency malaria outbreak in Chad and the 
Extreme North Province of Cameroon affected more  
than 600,000 people. Officials from Esso Chad and the  
ExxonMobil Foundation met with local, national and  
international health authorities to assess the impact of the 
epidemic on our employees and the communities where we 
live and work. They specifically discussed strategies to  
coordinate the response and reduce malaria cases in the  
Komé area of Chad, where 46 percent of our Chadian work-
force lives. ExxonMobil awarded a grant to Malaria No More 
(MNM) to design an emergency response plan aimed at  
preparing and training health practitioners to detect and 
respond to malaria outbreaks. Working with the Chad  
National Malaria Control Program, MNM is updating the 
National Malaria Health Care Handbook and is training  
health care professionals in the 1,238 health centers in  
Chad on how to use the handbook. For more information,

Corporate Signature Initiatives 
2013 Highlights

MATH AND SCIENCE INITIATIVE
To improve math and science education in the United States, 
ExxonMobil has supported the National Math and Science 
Initiative (NMSI) since its inception in 2007. Thus far,  
ExxonMobil has committed $125 million to this important 
endeavor. Over the past six years, the program has reached 
551 schools in 22 states, improving the lives of more than  
2 million students who have had the opportunity to learn 
from a NMSI-trained instructor. Each year, a growing number 
of schools benefit from NMSI. The schools that implemented 
NMSI’s Advanced Placement (AP) program in the 2012–2013 
school year saw immediate results; the average first-year 
increase in the number of qualifying AP math, science and 
English scores at NMSI schools was 72 percent — 10 times  
the national average. In addition, the number of qualifying 
scores on AP math and science exams achieved by female 
students has tripled from 2007 to 2013. For more information,

HUMAN RIGHTS AND MANAGING COMMUNITY IMPACTS2013 Corporate Citizenship ReportUp Close: 
UN Foundation  
Research Partnership 

Research has demonstrated that when women are econom-
ically empowered, communities and nations benefit. Yet 
practitioners still faced a crucial knowledge gap regarding the 
most effective interventions that directly advance women’s 
economic opportunities. To address this gap, the UN  
Foundation and the ExxonMobil Foundation joined forces 
in 2012 to produce A Roadmap for Promoting Women’s 
Economic Empowerment. The study, led by Mayra Buvinic, an 
international expert on gender and social development issues, 
brought together the work of more than 35 economists and 
other professionals from universities, international agencies 
and nonprofit groups. 

The report summarizes the findings of 18 research studies 
with a focus on programs in four categories: entrepreneurship, 
farming, wage employment and young women’s employment. 
Based on these studies, the project compiled a database of 
136 published empirical evaluations of programs and policies. 
The report systematically evaluated the evidence through three 
lenses: what works, for whom and where. It also looked at the 
cost-effectiveness and sustainability of programs. Key findings 
from the report include: 

Proven and promising interventions: Based on empirical 
evidence, the roadmap identifies nine proven and nine prom-
ising interventions; they include savings accounts, proven to 
increase women’s productivity and earnings, and the use of 
mobile phones, which promise to deliver financial services and 

market information in a cost-effective way to women farmers 
and entrepreneurs. 

The very poor need more: Very poor women need a more 
intensive package of services than less poor women to break 
out of subsistence production. 

In-kind assistance: Providing in-kind assistance rather than 
cash can help nudge women microentrepreneurs to keep cap-
ital in their businesses and avoid pressure to divert it to family 
members or to meet other household needs. 

Wage employment: Access to child care increases women’s 
wage employment levels and earnings, but design and delivery 
matter to ensure affordable care. 

Young women: Cash grants to poor and very poor young 
women may increase their employment options and resulting 
income, which can have sizeable social benefits. 

Country context: Whether an intervention works depends on 
the economic situation of a woman and the context in which 
she lives. In high-fertility, agrarian economies, for example, 
programs for women farmers need to be complemented 
by interventions seeking to reduce women’s work and time 
burdens, including access to quality family planning and repro-
ductive health services. In resource-rich economies and small 
island nations, programs should seek to identify and develop 
domestic and niche export markets that are accessible to 
women producers. 

The report provides funders, NGOs and governments with a 
framework for making investment decisions and recommen-
dations on evidence-based programs. At ExxonMobil, we are 
using the report’s findings to help us develop and fund more 
effective women’s economic empowerment programs around 
the globe. For more information, see womeneconroadmap.org 
and exxonmobil.com/womensinitiative.

“There is no silver bullet. The investments that work depend 
on the characteristics of the woman and her environment. 
We discovered a simple truth: The very poorest women need 
more interventions because they face so many constraints.”

— Mayra Buvinic, UN Foundation Senior Fellow and lead author

HUMAN RIGHTS AND MANAGING COMMUNITY IMPACTS2013 Corporate Citizenship ReportCountry-Led Initiatives  
2013 Highlights

BRAZIL

Thanks to support from ExxonMobil, the Refazer Institute in Brazil was able to expand its 
support to low-income families with chronically ill children in Rio de Janeiro. The institute’s vol-
unteers had been providing quality-of-life improvements to the families with hospital supplies, 
medicine, food and discussions about health and wellness. Now, under an ExxonMobil- 
sponsored program called Grife Refazer, the group is offering professional training to patients’ 
mothers with the goal of developing skills that can lead to work-from-home income. The first 
class of 18 mothers began training in September 2013, learning crafts such as embroidery and 
making jewelry, purses and home decorations. The products are sold from a recently rented 
building near the institute. Local businesses also place orders for specific products they design, 
which the mothers then produce at home. Participants say the program is an uplifting experi-
ence. “With a chronically ill child, we are unable to enter the workforce and this hurts our fami-
lies financially,” one mother in the program said. “We have the capacity to be productive  
as we care for our families, and now we have the tools to make it happen.” 

SAUDI ARABIA

ExxonMobil Saudi Arabia is one of the founding members of the Prince Salman Center for 
Disability Research (PSCDR), which provides disabled individuals in Saudi Arabia with the tools 
and support they need to become productive members of society. PSCDR’s mission is to advance 
insights into the causes of disabilities and develop new strategies to prevent or reduce their 
impacts. The center conducts basic and applied research and promotes the application of new 
knowledge to benefit individuals living with disabilities. Last year, ExxonMobil Saudi Arabia joined 
PSCDR to celebrate its 20th anniversary and to commemorate the center’s many national and 
international accomplishments related to disability research.

Board of Directors

The ExxonMobil board of  
directors and board committees 
provide oversight of the 
corporation’s operations.

Our board of directors provides independent oversight of the 
corporation’s affairs. All directors are required to stand for 
election at our annual meeting of shareholders. At year-end 
2013, 12 of 13 directors, including the presiding director and 
all members of key board committees, were independent 
as defined by New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) guidelines. 
In 2013, the board of directors met 11 times and visited an 
integrated refining and chemical plant in Europe to review 
affiliated operations.

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE

Each year, the independent board members select an inde-
pendent director to serve a minimum of two years as presiding 
director. The presiding director chairs executive sessions of  
the independent directors and coordinates with the chairman 
on board agendas, topics and schedules. Any director may 
request agenda topics for board or board committee meetings 
and has the authority to call special meetings of the indepen-
dent directors.

At this time, the board believes the best interests of the share-
holders are served through a leadership model that combines 
the roles of chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
(CEO). With more than 38 years of service in both domestic  
and international positions, our current CEO possesses 
in-depth knowledge of the corporation and the challenges  
of an evolving energy industry.

BOARD APPOINTMENT PROCESS

The diversity of our board members as it relates to gender, race, 
geography, experience and fields of expertise is important to 
succeeding in a globalized market. The Board Affairs Committee 

nominates director candidates in accordance with the Guidelines 
for the Selection of Non-Employee Directors, and diversity is 
a key consideration. The committee looks for highly qualified 
non-employee candidates with demonstrated leadership and 
competency in a particular field and a commitment to repre-
sent the interests of our shareholders. Other desirable qualities 
include:

•  Financial expertise

•  Experience as the CEO or senior executive of a significant 
company or organization with responsibilities for global 
operations

•  Experience on one or more boards of significant public 

organizations or NGOs

•  Expertise resulting from significant professional or  
academically based scientific or research activities

In 2013, the board included female, African-American and 
international perspectives. William C. Weldon joined the board 

Our board of directors provides independent oversight of the corporation’s affairs. Board members from left to right: Steven S Reinemund, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Jay S. Fishman, William W. George, Henrietta H. Fore, Kenneth C.

BOARD COMMITTEES 

Corporate citizenship topics fall under the purview of the 
Public Issues and Contributions Committee, the Board Affairs 
Committee and the Compensation Committee, and are rou-
tinely reviewed at board committee meetings. Only indepen-
dent directors serve on these committees, each of which met 
between four and seven times in 2013.

The entire ExxonMobil board of directors receives in-depth 
briefings at least annually that cover updates on public policy 
and energy-related scientific and technical research, as well as 
company positions and actions in these areas. While risk over-
sight is the responsibility of the entire board, committees help 
the board focus on risk aspects relevant to each committee. 

    View our committees’ charters

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
AND STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE 

At ExxonMobil, our compensation program is carefully  
structured to support long-term shareholder value given the  
capital-intensive nature of our business, long investment lead 
times and the critical importance of managing risks. The most 
senior executives — including the CEO, Named Executive  
Officers and more than 1,000 other executives in the United 
States — participate in a common compensation program. 

Compensation for executives is based on a rigorous annual 
individual performance assessment process taking into 
account several key performance factors, including results 
in the areas of safety, security, health and environmental 
performance. ExxonMobil executives understand that their 
compensation will reflect how effectively they manage risk. 

The design of the compensation program, including long 
holding periods for stock-based awards and risk of forfeiture 
of these awards, ensures that senior executives have a strong 
financial incentive to focus on the long-term integrity of our 
operations. This in turn protects the safety and security of our 
employees, the communities and environments in which we 
operate and the long-term sustainable value of the company 
for shareholders.

The Compensation Committee carefully considered the results 
of the 2013 advisory vote on executive compensation, in 

which 70.6 percent of the votes cast were “for” the company’s 
compensation program. The committee considered share-
holder feedback on executive compensation received  
through management engagement with shareholders,  
including the company’s largest shareholders, many of whom 
have held ExxonMobil stock for more than a decade. The  
committee determined that the company’s current compen-
sation program continues to support ExxonMobil’s business 
model. See pages 60–62 of ExxonMobil’s proxy statement 
issued on April 11, 2014, for a more in-depth discussion of  
the say-on-pay vote.

Board Visit to the Gravenchon  
Platform in Europe

ExxonMobil’s Gravenchon Platform is an integrated Down-
stream and Chemical facility strategically located approximately 
15 miles from the deep-sea port of Le Havre on the English 
Channel in France. ExxonMobil and its predecessor firms have 
operated the site for more than 80 years. Today, refined fuels, 
lubricants and chemicals are produced at the facility.

In June 2013, ExxonMobil directors and executives visited the 
Gravenchon Platform. During the visit, which encompassed 
tours of various production facilities such as the automated 
lubricant oil blending plant, participants viewed how  
ExxonMobil’s competitive advantages have been successfully 
implemented in this major, mature industrial site. The visit also 
included a tour of the state-of-the-art offsite operations hub 
and control room, and presentations by site employees.

COMMUNICATING WITH DIRECTORS

ExxonMobil’s directors encourage open and transparent 
communication on corporate citizenship topics. Individuals 
can email our non-employee directors through the Corporate 
Governance page of our website or send written correspon-
dence in care of the Secretary of the Corporation. ExxonMobil 
employees work closely with directors in responding to these 
letters and emails. Directors sometimes request that senior 
managers meet with shareholders to address particular topics.

Shareholder Relations

Constructive engagement with our 
shareholders allows us to identify 
areas of opportunity and improve-
ment throughout our business.

We engage in constructive dialogue with our shareholders on a 
variety of topics throughout the year. In 2013, we had 32 share-
holder dialogues with labor unions, religious organizations, state 
pension funds, socially responsible investors and institutional 
shareholders. At ExxonMobil’s 2013 annual meeting, sharehold-
ers owning approximately 3.7 billion — or more than 82 percent 
— of outstanding shares were represented. Shareholders voted 
on directors, independent auditors, executive compensation and 
eight shareholder proposals.

Every year, shareholders submit suggestions on ways to 
improve the company. Management and the board consider 
these suggestions and engage with the proposal sponsors. 
The Corporate Citizenship Report, Energy Outlook, Carbon 
Disclosure Project response and ExxonMobil’s website content 
have been helpful in building understanding regarding the

company’s achievements. We report transparently on issues 
important to our shareholders through these and other 
sources. Over the past five years, shareholders have with-
drawn 17 proposals on governance, social and environmental 
issues as a result of our engagement efforts.

When agreement on a shareholder proposal is not reached, 
the proposal and the board’s response and recommenda-
tions are published in our proxy statement for review at the 
annual meeting. For example, a proposal submitted in 2013 
requested ExxonMobil to report on its lobbying policies and 
procedures, as well as lobbying expenses beyond what we 
currently do in conformity with applicable laws. After careful 
consideration, the board determined the company ’s current 
transparency and accountability around lobbying activities 
were appropriate. Shareholder support for this proposal was 
approximately 25 percent. 

Ethics and Integrity

ExxonMobil’s Standards of Business 
Conduct guide the daily actions of 
each employee — from our board 
to our personnel working in front-
line operations — and ensure we

ethical and operational integrity.

country of the world requires training of employees, officers, 
directors and those acting on our behalf on U.S. anti-corruption, 
anti-trust, anti-boycott, trade sanctions and export controls 
laws, as well as those in other countries applicable to our 
business. All directors, officers and employees are expected to 
uphold the highest ethical standards of business integrity.

Employees are subject to disciplinary action, including termi-
nation, for violations of our policies. Employees receive training 
on our ethics policy every four years through business practice 
reviews, including a detailed review of our Standards of Business 
Conduct, implementation guidelines and procedures, including 
the corporation’s anti-trust, anti-corruption, gifts and enter-
tainment, and international operations policies. In addition to 
these business practice reviews, our law department conducts 
live, comprehensive training sessions annually on anti-trust and 
anti-corruption compliance for directors, officers, employees 
and third parties acting on ExxonMobil’s behalf. In addition, 
regular training is provided on anti-boycott, trade sanctions and 
export controls for employees with relevant job functions.

STANDARDS OF BUSINESS CONDUCT

Our Standards of Business Conduct define the global ethical 
conduct of the corporation and its majority-owned subsidiar-
ies. These Standards, adopted and administered by the board 
of directors, cover labor, the environment and anti-corruption, 
among other topics. While ExxonMobil is not a formal signatory 
of the United Nations Global Compact, its values represent key 
elements of our Standards. No one has authority to make excep-
tions or grant waivers to the Standards. Each year, employees 
complete a certification process confirming they have reviewed 
and are familiar with the Standards. We take disciplinary action 
against any employee who violates the Standards. 

INTERNAL AUDITS

Regular internal audits and self-assessments help ensure 
the rigorous implementation of our control systems and the 

Standards of Business Conduct. ExxonMobil’s internal team  
of more than 200 auditors annually audits approximately  
one-third of ExxonMobil’s operations, conducting detailed 
assessments of facilities, business units, personnel and records, 
and thoroughly investigating noncompliance with the  
Standards. These audits are conducted across all functions  
of the corporation.

BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION

The Anti-Corruption Legal Compliance Guide outlines 
ExxonMobil’s commitment to comply with the U.S. Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdom Bribery 
Act and global anti-corruption standards in our business 
relationships. It also describes elements of the corporation’s 
anti-corruption compliance program. 

ExxonMobil employees and contractors are prohibited from 
making payments to, or engaging in transactions with, gov-
ernment officials to influence the performance of their official 
duties improperly. Maintaining internal controls and keeping 
accurate and complete transaction records are required. 
Our standard language for procurement contracts includes 
a requirement to comply with all laws and keep accurate 
books and records, and, where appropriate, contains specific 
anti-bribery commitments. 

TRAINING

The nature of our business often takes us to remote parts of 
the world with changing political and regulatory climates; this 
makes it imperative we train our employees on ethics and 
integrity topics. In 2013, approximately 18,000 employees 
took part in anti-corruption training. This training covers the 
basics of the FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, global 
anti-corruption standards, recent developments in enforce-
ment, and compliance with our internal anti-corruption policy, 
guidelines and processes. Employees in positions assessed 
to be higher-risk receive training every year and within three 

Stakeholder Engagement: 
Learning from Our Shareholders

Engaging our shareholders is an important way to receive 
feedback and participate in a dialogue regarding their 
concerns. In December 2013, we met with approximately  
25 climate proponents and advocates from state and city 
pension funds, socially responsible investors and other 
interested parties. The meeting focused on topics such as 
our Energy Outlook, carbon assets, public policy and GHG 
emissions goals. Following our presentation, we received 
questions related to investments in sustainable energy, 
planning scenarios for outcomes different from those in the 
Energy Outlook and carbon asset risk. 

The group requested we take an even more active public 
role in explaining the consequences of climate change. The 
attending shareholders said they came away with a better 
understanding of ExxonMobil’s actions and positions. They 
also gained a keener appreciation for energy industry supply 
and demand and the consequences, especially for the less 
fortunate, if needed energy were arbitrarily capped. We 
will continue to communicate with these groups regarding 
climate-related shareholder proposals.

months of entering their positions. Every two years, we pro-
vide training to managers and professional employees not in 
higher-risk positions. Additionally, we monitor legal and regu-
latory developments and advise employees as appropriate.

SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES FOR REPORTING VIOLATIONS
We reinforce our commitment to ethics and high standards 
of business conduct by encouraging employees to report 
suspected violations of law and company policies or any 
other concerns. The corporation provides several confiden-
tial mechanisms for reporting, including a 24-hour phone 
number and a mailing address. Employees can also report 
violations during supervisory reviews. Confidentiality is 
respected throughout the investigation process, subject to 
legal requirements; retaliation against an employee for filing 
a report is strictly prohibited. A Hotline Steering Committee 
comprising security, internal audit, law and human resources 
personnel reviews reports of suspected violations. Internal 
audit provides a quarterly report to the Audit Committee that 
summarizes the Steering Committee’s findings, including 
any violations or major issues. Violations lead to disciplinary 
actions, including dismissal. 

Political Advocacy and 
Contributions

Annually, ExxonMobil lobbies in 
support of policies that are in the 
best interest of the company.

ExxonMobil continues to support policies that promote stable 
investment climates for long-term business viability. We make 

political contributions to candidate committees, political par-
ties, political associations and other political organizations as 
permitted by applicable laws in the United States and Canada, 
as well as authorized by the board of directors. The corpora-
tion refrains from making political contributions in any nation 
other than the United States and Canada. In 2013, Exxon 
Mobil Corporation contributed a total of $269,850 to  
legislative and gubernatorial candidates and caucuses in  
16 U.S. states. Information about our Political Activities Policy 
and Guidelines, and an itemized list of corporate political con-
tributions to national political organizations and state candi-
dates and caucuses, is available on our website. 

    Learn more about our political contributions 
    and lobbying

ExxonMobil’s employee- and retiree shareholder-funded politi-
cal action committee (PAC) disbursed $640,003 to federal and 
state candidates in 2013. Based on these contributions, CQ 
Moneyline listed the ExxonMobil PAC No. 57 in size compared 
with other corporate PACs. The ExxonMobil PAC ranked  
No. 41 in terms of receipts from employees and retiree  
shareholders. The rankings are compiled from publicly  
available data filed with the Federal Election Commission.

ExxonMobil, like many U.S. companies, labor unions and other 
entities, lobbies the U.S. Congress and state legislatures. We 
comply fully with regulations by reporting federal lobbying 
expenses in quarterly disclosure reports to Congress. In 2013, 
ExxonMobil reported lobbying expenses of $13.4 million. We 
lobbied on a number of issues last year, including the Keystone 
XL pipeline, onshore development of domestic resources, tax 
policy, international trade and education.

Keystone XL pipeline: ExxonMobil fully supports the permit-
ting of the Keystone XL pipeline project to bring Canadian oil 
to U.S. refineries. This will help grow the economy, provide 
jobs for our workers and increase American energy security.

Hydraulic fracturing: The United States sits atop tremendous 
natural resources, many of which have been locked away 
in difficult-to-reach formations. ExxonMobil supports the 
combined use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to 
enable the safe and economical production of these import-
ant energy sources. These technologies have been in use for 
decades; by combining them, the United States has seen a 
significant increase in domestic oil and gas production.

Tax policy: Tax policy can either help or hinder the ability of 
U.S. oil and gas companies to develop worldwide energy 
resources. ExxonMobil supports stable tax policies that enable 
the industry to remain competitive in the global marketplace. 
Energy development clearly benefits our economy, and sound 
tax policy that encourages investment and capital formation 
bolsters productivity and fosters job creation.

International trade: International trade is an important U.S. 
policy issue. ExxonMobil supports free trade of all products, 
including energy products such as oil and natural gas. Increasing 
trade benefits U.S. consumers and encourages more invest-
ment, sustains high-paying jobs and fosters economic growth.

Education: Improving U.S. educational performance is vital to 
the success of our industry and to national competitiveness. 
We applaud sensible, forward-looking efforts to raise aca-
demic standards and help teachers and students. We support 
STEM education initiatives and the Common Core State Stan-
dards as part of a path to renewed competitiveness.

There is widespread interest from many constituent groups on 
how the United States pursues sound policy on these issues. 
We anticipate and look forward to many active discussions 
with those who have an interest in these areas.

ABOUT THIS REPORT

This report was created in accordance with the reporting guidelines and indicators of the International Petroleum 
Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), the International Oil and Gas Producers Association 
(OGP) and the American Petroleum Institute (API) Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability 
Reporting (2010). The majority of these indicators are also consistent with the indicators used by the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) in the G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

Increasingly, we receive requests for corporate citizenship- 
related information from customers, suppliers, investors and 
external ranking institutions. To help these stakeholders easily 
access this information, we have mapped relevant GRI and IPIECA 
indicators on page 13 of this report and at exxonmobil.com. 
The report covers ExxonMobil’s operations from Jan. 1, 2013, 
through Dec. 31, 2013, unless otherwise indicated. The report 
uses both qualitative descriptions and quantitative metrics to 
explain our policies, programs and practices.

For environmental performance data, units of measure are 
metric where noted. Financial information is reported in  
U.S. dollars. Exxon Mobil Corporation has numerous  
affiliates, with many names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, 
Mobil, Esso and XTO Energy. For convenience and simplicity, 
those terms (and terms such as corporation, company, our, 
we, us and its) are sometimes used as abbreviated references 
to specific affiliates or affiliate groups. ExxonMobil includes 
the above-mentioned operations as part of company perfor-
mance data (see page 11).

The term “project” as used in this publication can refer to a 
variety of different activities and does not necessarily have 
the same meaning as in any government payment transpar-
ency reports.

This document is subject to the provision below:

This Assurance Statement is only valid when published with the 
Report to which it refers. It may only be reproduced in its entirety.

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited, its affiliates and subsidiaries 
and their respective officers, employees or agents are, individually and 
collectively, referred to in this clause as the “Lloyd’s Register Group.” 
The Lloyd’s Register Group assumes no responsibility and shall not be 
liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense caused by reliance 
on the information or advice in this document or howsoever provided, 
unless that person has signed a contract with the relevant Lloyd’s 
Register Group entity for the provision of this information or advice, and 
in that case, any responsibility or liability is exclusively on the terms and 
conditions set out in that contract.

Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control, it is possible 
that fraud, error or noncompliance with laws and regulations may 
occur and not be detected. Further, the verification was not designed 
to detect all weakness or errors in internal controls so far as they relate 
to the requirements set out above, as the verification has not been per-
formed continuously throughout the period and the verification carried 
out on the relevant internal controls was on a test basis. Any projection 
of the evaluation of control to future periods is subject to the risk that 
the processes may become inadequate because of changes in condi-
tions, or that the degree of compliance with them may deteriorate.

The English version of this statement is the only valid version. The 
Lloyd’s Register Group assumes no responsibility for versions trans-
lated into other languages.
